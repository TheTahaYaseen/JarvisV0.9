name,line
ANT,"</b> No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no."
ANT,</b> I'm lost! Where's the line? It just went away. What do I do?
ANT,</b> Help! 
ANT,</b> We'll be stuck here forever!
 SOIL,"</b> Do not panic! Do not panic! We are trained professionals! Now, stay calm. We are going around the leaf."
ANT,</b> A-Around the leaf? I-I don't think we can do that.
 SOIL,"</b> Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of '93."
 SOIL,</b> That's it. That's it. Good! You're doing great! There you go. There you go!
 SOIL,</b> Watch my eyes. Don't look away. And here's the line again.
ANT,"</b> (gleeful shout) Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Soil!"
 SOIL,"</b> Good job, everybody!"
 FLORA,"</b> Oh, my. There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil. Shouldn't we tell the queen?"
 SOIL,"</b> I don't think we need to involve the queen in this. She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter."
 FLORA,"</b> Oh, yes, Princess Atta. The poor dear."
ATTA,</b> Oh... Wind's died down. They'll be here soon.
QUEEN,"</b> Just be confident, dear. You'll be fine."
ATTA,</b> Ah! There's a gap. There's a gap in the line! What are we gonna do?!
THORNY,"</b> It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen. We just lost a few inches, that's all."
ATTA,"</b> Oh, right."
THORNY,"</b> Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that."
ATTA,"</b> Oh, of course. I'm sorry. (chuckle) Go ahead."
QUEEN,"</b> Guys, go shade someone else for a while. Okay, Atta. Now what do we do?"
ATTA,</b> Oh! Don't tell me. I know it. I know it. What is it?
QUEEN,</b> We relax!
ATTA,</b> Right.
QUEEN,"</b> Oh, it'll be fine. It's the same, year after year. They come, they eat, they leave. That's our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life. (laughs) Isn't that right, Aphie? Oh, you're such a cute little aphid."
VIOLET ANT BOY,</b> Ditch Dot!
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> Yeah, yeah!"
DOT,"</b> Hey, come back here!"
DOT,</b> (grunts)
QUEEN,</b> Dot!
DOT,"</b> Yes, Mother."
QUEEN,</b> What did I tell you about trying to fly?
DOT,</b> Not until my wings grow in.
QUEEN,</b> Right.
DOT,"</b> But, Mom--"
ATTA,"</b> Dot, you're a young queen ant, and your wings are too little to be--"
DOT,"</b> I was talking to Mother. You're not the queen yet, Atta."
QUEEN,"</b> Now, Dot, be nice to your sister."
DOT,</b> It's not my fault she's so stressed out.
ATTA,"</b> (sigh) I know, I know. (sigh) I'm always acting like the sky is falling."
 SOIL,</b> Look out!
ATTA,</b> Ah!
QUEEN,</b> Atta!
THORNY,</b> Princess Atta!
 FLORA,</b> Princess Atta! Princess Atta!
ATTA,</b> Oh!
 SOIL,</b> Look out!
 FLORA,</b> Hey! Stop that!
 SOIL,</b> What do you think you're doing?
 FLORA,</b> You could have killed somebody over here!
FLIK,</b> (gasp) I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
THORNY,"</b> Oh, it's Flik."
CORNELIUS,</b> (groan)
FLIK,"</b> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! Please forgive me. I'm sorry! "
FLIK,</b> (scream) Princess Atta!
ATTA,"</b> Flik, what are you doing?"
FLIK,"</b> Oh... Oh, this! This is my new idea for harvesting grain. No more picking individual kernels. You can just cut down the entire stalk!"
ATTA,"</b> Flik, we don't have time for this."
FLIK,"</b> Exactly! We never have time to collect food for ourselves, because we spend all summer harvesting for the offering. But my invention will speed up production."
ATTA,</b> (groan) Another invention?
FLIK,"</b> Yeah, and I've got something for you, too."
ATTA,</b> (sigh) Flik!
FLIK,"</b> Since you're gonna be queen soon, you could use this to oversee production. Dr. Flora, if I may."
 FLORA,</b> (gasp) Oh!
ATTA,"</b> This is all very nice, but--"
THORNY,</b> What?
FLIK,"</b> Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right?"
ATTA,"</b> Flik, please."
FLIK,"</b> Wrong! It is, in fact..."
FLIK,</b> ...A telescope!
 DOT,</b> (laughing)
ATTA,"</b> It's very clever, Flik, but--"
FLIK,"</b> Hello, princess! My, aren't you looking lovely this morning! Not, of course, that you would need a telescope to see that--"
THORNY,"</b> All right, listen! The princess doesn't have time for this! You want to help us fill this thing? Then get rid of that machine, get back in line and pick grain like everybody else!"
CORNELIUS,</b> Like everybody else!
ATTA,"</b> Please, Flik. Just go."
FLIK,</b> I'm sorry. I was-- I was really just trying... Trying to help.
CORNELIUS,"</b> Harvester. Why, we've harvested the same way ever since I was a pupa."
ATTA,</b> (exasperated sigh) Where were we?
 SOIL,"</b> The food pile, Your Highness."
ATTA,"</b> Oh, yes. Yes."
DOT,"</b> Hey, Flik! Flik, wait up!"
FLIK,"</b> Oh. Hello, princess."
DOT,"</b> You can call me Dot. Here, you forgot this."
FLIK,</b> Thanks. You can keep it. I can...make another one.
DOT,</b> I like your inventions.
FLIK,"</b> Really? Well, you're the first. I'm beginning to think nothing I do works."
DOT,</b> This works.
FLIK,</b> Great. One success. (sigh) I'm never gonna make a difference.
DOT,"</b> Me, neither. I'm a royal ant, and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little."
FLIK,"</b> Oh, being little's not such a bad thing."
DOT,"</b> Yes, it is."
FLIK,"</b> No, it's not."
DOT,"</b> Is, too!"
FLIK,</b> Is not.
DOT,"</b> Is, too."
FLIK,</b> Is not. Is not. Is not.
DOT,"</b> Is, too. Is, too. Is, too."
FLIK,</b> Is not-- Oh... A seed. I need-- I need a seed. Uh... (grunts)
FLIK,"</b> (groan) Uh, here, here."
FLIK,</b> Pretend-- Pretend that that's a seed.
DOT,</b> It's a rock.
FLIK,"</b> Oh, I know it's a rock. I know. Uh, but let's just pretend for a minute that it's a seed, all right? We'll just use our imaginations. Now-Now do you see our tree? Everything that made that giant tree is already contained inside this tiny little seed. All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and voila!"
DOT,</b> This rock will be a tree?
FLIK,"</b> Seed to tree. You've got to work with me, here, all right? Okay. Now, you might not feel like you can do much now, but that's just because, well, you're not a tree yet. You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed."
DOT,</b> But it's a rock.
FLIK,</b> I know it's a rock! Don't you think I know a rock when I see a rock? I've spent a lot of time around rocks!
DOT,"</b> (laughing) You're weird, but I like you."
FLIK,</b> (gasp) They're here.
ANTS,</b> They're here!
ANT,</b> Run!
DOT,</b> Mom! Where are you?
ANTS,</b> They're coming! Run!
QUEEN,</b> Dot! Dot!
DOT,</b> Mom! Mom!
ATTA,</b> Single file!
QUEEN,</b> Thank heavens!
ATTA,"</b> Please, everyone. Uh, food to the offering stone."
QUEEN,"</b> (whistle) Okay, everyone, single file. Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go!"
ANT,"</b> Go, go, go, go!"
ATTA,"</b> Come on! Keep moving, keep moving! Good!"
ATTA,</b> Okay. That's everyone.
FLIK,"</b> Hey! Hey, wait for me!"
FLIK,"</b> Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill."
FLIK,</b> Huh?
FLIK,"</b> (scream) Ah! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! "
FLIK,</b> No! Oh! Oh! (grunts)
FLIK,"</b> Oh, no..."
FLIK,</b> Princess Atta! Princess Atta! Princess Attaaaa!
ATTA,"</b> (whispering) They come, they eat, they leave. They come, they eat, they leave."
FLIK,"</b> Excuse me. 'Scuse me, pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me, coming through. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta, there's something I need to tell you."
ATTA,"</b> Not now, Flik."
FLIK,"</b> (whispering) But, Your Highness, it's about the offering!"
ATTA,</b> Shh!
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Hey, what's goin' on?"
MOLT,</b> Yeah! Where's the food?
ATTA,</b> (whispers) What did you do?
FLIK,</b> It was an accident?
GRASSHOPPER,</b> (cackling)
GRASSHOPPERS,</b> (whooping)
MOLT,</b> Boo! (laugh) Where's the food?
FLIK,</b> (shuddering) Hopper.
HOPPER,</b> So where is it?
HOPPER,</b> Where's my food?!
ATTA,</b> Uh... I-Isn't it up...there?
HOPPER,</b> What?
ATTA,</b> The food was in a leaf sitting on top--
HOPPER,</b> Excuse me?
ATTA,</b> Are you sure it's not up there?
HOPPER,</b> Are you saying I'm stupid?
ATTA,</b> No.
HOPPER,"</b> Do I look...stupid...to you? Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Let's just think about it for a second. If it was up there, would I be coming down here, to your level, looking for it?!"
ATTA,</b> I-- 
HOPPER,</b> Why am I even talking to you? You're not the queen. You don't smell like the queen.
QUEEN,"</b> She's learning to take over from me, Hopper."
HOPPER,"</b> Oh, I see. Under new management. So it's your fault."
ATTA,"</b> No, i-it wasn't me. It was--"
HOPPER,</b> Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership: everything is your fault.
ATTA,"</b> But, but I--"
HOPPER,"</b> It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess. One of those circle-of-life kind of things. Now, let me tell you how things are supposed to work. The sun grows the food. The ants pick the food. The grasshoppers eat the food--"
MOLT,"</b> And the birds eat the grasshoppers. Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you 'member? You 'member-- Oh, you should've seen it."
HOPPER,</b> Molt.
MOLT,"</b> This blue jay, he has him halfway down his throat, okay? And Hopper, Hopper's kicking and screaming, okay? And I'm scared, okay? I'm not going anywhere near, okay? Oh, come on! It's a great story!"
MOLT,</b> Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow-ow--
MOLT,</b> Oof!
HOPPER,"</b> I swear, if I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you."
MOLT,"</b> And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do."
HOPPER,</b> Shut up! I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island. Do you understand me?
MOLT,</b> (whimper)
HOPPER,"</b> I said, do you understand me?!"
MOLT,"</b> Well, how can I answer? You said I couldn't say another word."
HOPPER,</b> (growl)
MOLT,</b> Ah! Remember Ma!
HOPPER,"</b> (panting) Hey, I'm a compassionate insect. There's still a few months 'til the rains come, so you can all just try again."
QUEEN,"</b> But, Hopper, since it's almost the rainy season, we need this time to gather food for ourselves."
HOPPER,"</b> Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain, then I can't guarantee your safety. And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you. Someone could get hurt. (snaps fingers)"
DOT,</b> (shivering)
THUMPER,"</b> (snarling, roars)"
DOT,"</b> (gasps, panting, yelps)"
HOPPER,</b> What's the matter? You scared of grasshoppers?
DOT,</b> (panicking)
FLIK,</b> Dot!
HOPPER,</b> You don't like Thumper?
DOT,</b> (whimpering)
THUMPER,</b> (snarling)
FLIK,</b> Leave her alone!
HOPPER,</b> You want her? Go ahead. Take her.
DOT,</b> (whimpering)
HOPPER,</b> No? Then get back in line.
HOPPER,</b> It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place. So let's double the order of food.
FLIK,</b> (gasp)
ATTA,"</b> No! But, but, but--"
HOPPER,</b> We'll be back at the end of the season...
HOPPER,</b> ...When the last...leaf...falls.
HOPPER,</b> You ants have a nice summer. Let's ride!
GRASSHOPPERS,</b> Yee-haw! (whooping)
MOLT,"</b> (laughs, pained grunt)"
FLIK,</b> (nervous chuckle)
ATTA,"</b> Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?"
FLIK,"</b> Sorry. I-- I'm sorry for the way I am. I didn't mean for things to go so wrong. I...especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess."
ATTA,"</b> Well, Flik, you did."
FLIK,</b> I was just trying to help.
 SOIL,</b> Then help us. Don't help us.
FLIK,</b> Help? Help? Help?
ATTA,"</b> Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels."
THORNY,"</b> Uh, excuse me, Your Highness. Need I remind you of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?"
FLIK,</b> Helpers to help us. That could-- That's it! We could...
THORNY,</b> It took the whole engineering department two days to dig him out. Send him to Health and Ant Services.
 FLORA,"</b> Heavens, no!"
FLIK,"</b> We could leave the island. The riverbed's dry right now. We could just walk right across the riverbed. We could go get helpers. We could! We could leave, sure. We could go find helpers to help us. It's perfect!"
QUEEN,</b> Perfect? What's so perfect?
FLIK,"</b> Your Highness, don't you see? We could send someone to get help!"
ANT COUNCIL,</b> (gasps)
ATTA,</b> Leave the island?
QUEEN,"</b> Now, why didn't I think of that? Oh! Because it's suicide!"
THORNY,</b> She's right! We never leave the island!
CORNELIUS,</b> Never leave!
THORNY,</b> There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there!
FLIK,</b> Exactly! Bigger bugs! We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight and forever rid us of Hopper and his gang!
 SOIL,</b> Ludicrous!
 FLORA,</b> Who would do a crazy thing like that?
FLIK,</b> I'll volunteer. I'd be very happy to volunteer.
QUEEN,"</b> (laughs) You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants."
 FLORA,"</b> At least we could try. Oh, I-I could-- I could travel to the city. I could search there!"
ATTA,"</b> If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks."
THORNY,</b> Royal huddle.
THORNY,"</b> (whispering) Great idea, princess. It's perfect."
CORNELIUS,</b> Exactly.
ATTA,</b> Wait a minute. What did we just decide here?
 SOIL,</b> To let Flik leave.
CORNELIUS,</b> While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands.
 FLORA,"</b> You see? With Flik gone, he can't --"
ATTA,</b> He can't mess anything up!
ATTA,"</b> Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided...to grant you your request."
FLIK,</b> Really?
QUEEN,</b> Really?
ATTA,"</b> Uh, really."
FLIK,"</b> Oh! Thank you, princess. Thank you so much for this chance. I-I-I won't let you down, I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise."
ATTA,"</b> Yeah, yeah, that's fine, that's fine. No, forget it, forget it."
FLIK,"</b> But I should probably help repair some of the damage before I go, don't you think--"
ANT COUNCIL,"</b> No! No, no!"
ATTA,</b> Just go. Just go.
CORNELIUS,</b> Just leave!
FLIK,</b> (suavely) Hey.
FLIK,"</b> Don't worry! The colony is in good hands! Bye, now."
ANTS,</b> (cheering)
FLIK,</b> (breathes in) All right.
FLIK,"</b> Hey, fellas. Beautiful morning, huh?"
BLUE ANT BOY,</b> My dad says he gives you one hour before you come back to the island crying.
FLIK,"</b> Does he, now?"
VIOLET ANT BOY,</b> My dad doesn't think that.
FLIK,"</b> He doesn't, huh?"
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> Nah, he's bettin' you're gonna die. "
FLIK,</b> Oh.
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> Yeah, he says if the heat doesn't get you, the birds will."
DOT,"</b> Well, I think he's gonna make it."
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness."
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> Yeah, Dot. What do you know?"
FLIK,"</b> Hey, hey, hey. Ease up, all right? Come on. She's entitled to her opinion, too. Ohh..."
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> So go, already."
BLUE ANT BOY,</b> Hey!
VIOLET ANT BOY,</b> The city's that way!
FLIK,</b> I know.
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions!"
DOT,</b> You leave him alone. He knows what he's doing.
FLIK,</b> That's right! Here I go! For the colony and for oppressed ants everywhere!
FLIK,</b> Whoa...
DOT,</b> Wow!
FLIK,</b> Hey!
DOT,"</b> Bye, Flik!"
FLIK,</b> Wow. Whoa!
DOT,"</b> Good luck, Flik!"
FLIK,</b> Bye! (pained grunt)
DOT,</b> Flik!
FLIK,</b> (muffled) I'm okay!
BLUE ANT BOY,</b> Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
DOT,"</b> You just watch. He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen!"
DIM,</b> (roaring)
ROSIE,"</b> Get back! Get back! Get back, you horrible beast! I have no fear!"
DIM,</b> Oh! (whimpers)
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, my goodness."
DIM,</b> (crying)
FLIES,</b> (booing)
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim."
DIM,"</b> Owie! Owie, owie! (sobs)"
ROSIE,"</b> An owie? Okay, show Rosie the owie. All right, Dim. It's okay."
FLY MOM,</b> (frustrated sigh) I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad. This is ridiculous. What a disappointment.
 FLEA,</b> (gasp) No!
FLY,</b> You! Come here! I want my money back!
 FLEA,"</b> Uh, no refunds after the first two minutes."
ROACH,</b> Popcorn! Stale popcorn!
 FLEA,</b> We're losin' the audience! You clowns get out there now!
HEIMLICH,</b> (groan) I hate performing on an empty stomach!
 FLEA,"</b> Do your act, Heimlich. Then you can eat."
SLIM,"</b> P.T., what's the point?"
 FLEA,"</b> Not now, Slim."
SLIM,</b> What's the point of going out there? They'll only laugh at me.
 FLEA,</b> That's because you're a clown!
SLIM,"</b> No, it's because I'm a prop! You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick!"
SLIM,</b> A splinter!
 FLEA,</b> You're a walking stick. It's funny! Now go!
SLIM,</b> You parasite.
FLIES,</b> (booing)
SLIM,</b> Tra-la-la-la-la. Spring is in the air. And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say.
FRANCIS,</b> (high-pitched) Ah!
SLIM,</b> A bee!
HEIMLICH,</b> I am a cute little bumblebee!
HEIMLICH,</b> Here I come!
 FRANCIS,</b> (dramatically screaming)
HEIMLICH,"</b> (panting) Slow down, you flowers!"
HEIMLICH,</b> Oh! Candy corn! (pants) Here. Let me help you to finish it.
FLY,"</b> Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate with a real bug? (laughing raucously) Ooh! Come to Papa, yeah!"
FRANCIS,"</b> So! Being a ladybug automatically makes me a girl! Is that it, fly boy?! Huh?!"
FLY,</b> Yikes! She's a guy!
HEIMLICH,"</b> Francis, leave them alone. They are poo-poo heads!"
 FLEA,</b> Not again.
FRANCIS,"</b> Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzin' around a dung heap all day!"
SLIM,"</b> Come on, Francis. You're making the maggots cry."
MAGGOTS,</b> (wailing)
GYPSY,</b> (operatic vocalizing)
 FLEA,"</b> All right, we're dying out there. Gypsy, quick, you and Manny--"
GYPSY,</b> Shh. He's in a trance.
 FLEA,"</b> Well, get him out of it! You and your husband are up now!"
GYPSY,"</b> Manny, we're on."
MANNY,"</b> Oh? Yet again it is up to me to rescue the performance. Gypsy, come."
GYPSY,</b> (humming)
MANNY,"</b> (crashes, groans)"
GYPSY,"</b> Stage is the other way, dear."
MANNY,"</b> Yes, of course."
FRANCIS,"</b> Anytime, pal! I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one!"
FLY,</b> Take your best shot!
FRANCIS,</b> You name the place!
FLY,"</b> Oh, yeah?"
FRANCIS,"</b> Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead!"
SLIM,"</b> Francis, let me handle this. That's no way to speak to a lady."
FRANCIS,"</b> I heard that, you twig!"
 FLEA,"</b> Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!"
MANNY,"</b> From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia, I give you the Chinese Cabinet of Metamorphosis!"
 FLEA,"</b> Rosie, whole troupe! On stage! Finale! Now!"
ROSIE,"</b> Okay, I just need a little time to--"
 FLEA,</b> Now!
ROSIE,"</b> Coming. Coming. Tuck, Roll. Let's get moving, guys. We're up next."
 ROLL,</b> (speaking foreign language)
ROSIE,</b> Don't you understand? We are up!
 ROLL,</b> Up-a! Up-a! (speaking foreign language)
 ROLL,</b> Hey!
ROSIE,</b> Hey! They don't understand me.
MANNY,</b> I summon the voice of Confucius...
FLY,"</b> Get off the stage, you old hack!"
MANNY,</b> (yelps) I demand to know who said that! (grunts)
MANNY,</b> How dare you! (yelps)
FLIES,</b> (booing)
MANNY,</b> Ingrates!
GYPSY,</b> (muffled) Manny? Manny!
FLY,"</b> I only got 24 hours to live, and I ain't gonna waste it here! Come on!"
 FLEA,</b> (screams)
 FLEA,</b> I've just about had it with these losers!
 FLEA,</b> Flaming death!
 FLEA,</b> I hold in my hand...the match! The match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening.
 FLEA,"</b> In a moment, I will light this trail of matches, leading to a sheet of flypaper doused in lighter fluid! Aimed directly at the flypaper are Tuck and Roll, the pill-bug cannonballs! The cannon will be triggered by Dim, trained to jump at the sound of this bell, set to go off in 15 seconds."
 FLEA,"</b> Our pill bugs' only hope of survival is our mistress of the high wire, Rosie! Secured to a web line of exact length, Rosie will plummet down to these two posts, spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds!"
 FLEA,"</b> Not good enough, you say? Well, what if they were all blindfolded?"
 FLEA,"</b> Ladies and gentlemen, may I suggest that those of you with weak constitutions leave the arena, for this act is so dangerous that if the slightest thing should go wrong..."
 FLEA,</b> No!
ROSIE,"</b> Go? Whoa! Okay, through the tunnel..."
GYPSY,</b> Whoa!
DIM,</b> (laughs)
ROSIE,"</b> Okay, that's done!"
 FLEA,</b> Whoa!
HEIMLICH,</b> (screams)
FRANCIS,</b> P.T.!
SLIM,"</b> Oh, no!"
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, dear..."
 FLEA,"</b> (panics, grunts)"
FRANCIS,</b> Water! We need some water!
SLIM,"</b> Water, water, water, water!"
FLIES,</b> (laughing)
 FLEA,</b> (panicking) Help! (grunting) Get me out of here!
 FLEA,</b> (laughs triumphantly)
FLY,</b> Wow!
ROSIE,</b> It's the-the web. I'm sorry. It's--
 FLEA,</b> You're all fired.
FRANCIS,</b> We got the water!
HEIMLICH,"</b> Here we come, P.T.!"
SLIM,</b> We'll save you!
FLY,</b> (clapping) Whoo! Whoa!
FLY,</b> Burn him again!
FLY,"</b> No! Harry, no! Don't look at the light!"
HARRY,</b> I can't help it... It's so beautiful!
HARRY,</b> (screams)
FLIK,</b> Try not to look like a country bug. Blend. Blend in.
BUG,"</b> Hey, buggy! Hey, buggy!"
BUG,</b> What do you expect? The guy's a tick.
BUG,</b> (laughing)
FLIK,</b> Wow! The city!
FLIK,</b> (impressed laugh)
BEETLE CAB,"</b> Makin' all stops to the septic tank, including standing water, empty bean can and dead rat. Watch your stingers. All aboard!"
BUG,"</b>  Hey, watch it."
BUG,</b>  Get out of the way!
FLIK,"</b> Oh, sorry."
SNAIL,</b> Ow! Watch where you're goin'!
FLIK,"</b> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't-- Oh, sorry!"
FLIK,"</b> Oh. I'm really, really sorry. That was an... An accident."
MOSQUITO,"</b> Hey, tough guy!"
FLY,"</b> Hey, let go of me!"
BEE,</b> I'll show you who's tough! And stay out!
FLIK,</b> Tough bugs!
ROACH,</b> I knew an old lady who swallowed a fly...
FLIK,</b> Wow...
FLY,</b> Move it!
FLIK,</b> Whoa!
BUG,"</b> Hey, waiter! I'm in my soup!"
BUG,</b> I've been working out. Feel my wing.
FLY,</b> Yo! Two Black Flags over here!
FLY,</b> All right.
ROACH,</b> (chuckles) Hair of the dog you bit.
BEETLE WAITRESS,"</b> Hey, who ordered the poo-poo platter?"
MOSQUITO WAITER,"</b> Here you go, slick. Enjoy."
SLUG,"</b> Ow-Oww! Hey, I said no salt!"
BUG,</b> Buzz off!
FLIK,"</b> Pardon me, sir, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment. I represent a colony, uh, of ants, and I'm looking for tough bugs, you know, mean bugs, the sort of bugs..."
SLIM,</b> Fired by a flea! How humiliating!
FRANCIS,</b> Let's face it. We stink.
ROLL,</b> You fired!
TUCK,</b> You fired!
ROLL,</b> You fired!
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, will you shut up?"
ROLL,</b> Hey! (laughs)
TUCK,</b> You fired!
HEIMLICH,"</b> Someday I will be a beautiful butterfly, and then everything will be better."
GYPSY,</b> I can't believe the troupe is breaking up. We've always been together.
MANNY,"</b> Farewell, my friends."
FRANCIS,</b> To the audience we'll never have.
SLIM,"</b> (gasps, whispers) Francis! Your boyfriends from the circus are here!"
FRANCIS,</b> (gasp)
FLY,</b> There she is.
FRANCIS,</b> (nervously popping lips)
FLY,"</b> Hello there, girlie bug."
FRANCIS,"</b> Shoo, fly. Don't bother me."
FLY,"</b> Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud..."
THUD,</b> (growl)
FLY,</b> ...What you said to us at the circus?
FLY,</b> Yeah. Something about buzzing around a dung heap?
FLIK,"</b> Excuse me. Hi. I represent an ant colony, and we're just--"
MOSQUITO,"</b> Hey, bartender! Bloody Mary, O-positive."
FLIK,</b> Sir?
FLIES,"</b> Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home! (laughing)"
FLY,"</b> Not so tough now, are you? All right, clown. Get up and fight like a girl."
FRANCIS,</b> (whispers) Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
HEIMLICH,</b> (giggles) I want to be Little John!
SLIM,</b> What part can I play?
FLIK,</b> I'm looking for tough warrior bugs.
FRANCIS,"</b> Stand back, ye flies! We are the greatest warriors in all bugdom!"
FLIK,</b> Warrior bugs!
FRANCIS,</b> My sword!
SLIM,"</b> Swish, swish. Clang, clang."
FRANCIS,</b> Little John?
HEIMLICH,"</b> What ho, Robin? Justice is my sword and truth shall be my quiver!"
FLIK,"</b> Wait, wait! No, no! I-I want to watch this!"
SLIM,"</b> Thrust, parry, lunge!"
THUD,</b> (growls)
SLIM,</b> Me thinketh it's not working!
HEIMLICH,"</b> (screams) Back to Sherwood Forest! Schnell, schnell!"
FLIK,</b> What's going on in there?
CIRCUS TROUPE,"</b> (clamoring, screaming)"
SLIM,</b> (muffled) Help! Help! Get me out!

FLIK,</b> Wow.
CIRCUS TROUPE,</b> (groaning)
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, ow-ow-ow..."
FLIK,"</b> You're perfect! Oh, great ones! I have been scouting for bugs with your exact talents!"
GYPSY,</b> (gasp) A talent scout.
FLIK,</b> My colony's in trouble. Grasshoppers are coming! We've been forced to prepare all this food.
MANNY,</b> Dinner theater!
HEIMLICH,</b> Food?
FLIK,</b> Please! Will you help us?!
THUD,</b> (groan)
FLY,</b> Where are they?
SLIM,</b> We'll take the job!
FLIK,</b> Really?
HEIMLICH,"</b> Yah, yah!"
BUG,"</b> Hurry, hurry! Make haste!"
SLIM,</b> You can explain the details on the way.
ROLL,</b> Hey-hey-hey!
TUCK,</b> (chuckles)
ROLL,</b> (grumbles in foreign language)
ROSIE,"</b> Okay, come on, everyone! Break a leg!"
FLIK,"</b> Whoa, you're vicious!"
DIM,"</b> Hold on, Mr. Ant."
FLIK,</b> Amazing! This is too good to be true!
FLIK,"</b> So you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back. But then, Princess Atta... Boy, is she one in a million. She let me go out and find you. And after seeing you fight off those flies... Boy, are those grasshoppers in for a big surprise! (LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY)"
TUCK,</b> (asks question in foreign language)
ANT,</b> (moans)
ATTA,</b> Dr. Flora!
 FLORA,"</b> Oh, dear. Not another one."
THORNY,</b> This is insane.
CORNELIUS,</b> Insane.
THORNY,</b> There's just not enough food left on the island! No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes!
ATTA,"</b> Well, we have to try, Thorny. We don't have any choice."
THORNY,</b> Yeah. I know.
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> Hey, look who's playing lookout again. Little Speck!"
DOT,</b> The name is Dot.
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> Well, Spot, you still looking for Flik?"
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> Forget it, Dot. That loser's never coming back."
DOT,</b> Flik! He did it! He did it!
VIOLET ANT BOY,</b> What?
BLUE ANT BOY,</b> Quit shoving!
FLIK,</b> This is it! This is Ant Island!
DOT,</b> Flik! Over here! Flik! Flik!
FLIK,</b> Hey!
DOT,</b> He did it! He did it! Yay! He did it! He did it!
VIOLET ANT BOY,</b> Cool!
 BLUE ANT BOY,</b> (yelp)
THORNY,"</b> At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle."
CORNELIUS,</b> That's right! We need a miracle!
CORNELIUS,</b> Run for your lives!
FRANCIS,</b> Ta-da!
MANNY,"</b> (sighs) Once again, our reputation precedes us."
FLIK,"</b> Hey, everybody! Hey! I'm back!"
FLIK,"</b> Hey, guys! Hey! Look. Look!"
FLIK,</b> Look who's here with me!
DOT,</b> Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
DOT,</b> I knew you could do it!
 SOIL,</b> Flik has returned!
ATTA,</b> He's back?
 SOIL,</b> And he's accompanied by savage insects!
ATTA,</b> What? How? He wasn't supposed to actually find someone!
CORNELIUS,"</b> Oh, my ticker!"
BLUE ANT BOY,"</b> So, what are you supposed to be?"
VIOLET ANT BOY,"</b> He's a stick, stupid. You hit bugs with him."
SLIM,</b> That's an oversimplification.
FRANCIS,"</b> That's right, kids. Like this!"
SLIM,</b> No! Put me down! Oh!
 ROLL,</b> Hey!
 FLORA,"</b> My, you just pop right open there, don't ya?"
ANT KIDS,</b> Ooh! Wow!
ROSIE,"</b> Kids, he's kind of ticklish."
DIM, (laughing)
ROSIE,</b> Let's come on out. Careful.
ANT KIDS,</b> (screaming and laughing)
QUEEN,"</b> Well, my boy, you came through! Aphie and I are very impressed."
FLIK,</b> Princess Atta! Hey!
FLIK,"</b> Hey, guys, this is Princess Atta! She's the one that sent me to find you!"
 SOIL,</b> He looks absolutely ferocious!
THORNY,</b> They're our ticket out of this mess!
 FLORA,</b> They came just in time!
ATTA,"</b> No, no, no, wait! This was not supposed to happen."
SLIM,"</b> Mayday, mayday. We're losing the job."
ATTA,</b> We don't fight grasshoppers!
THORNY,"</b> We don't, but they will."
CORNELIUS,</b> Bingo!
FRANCIS,</b> (pops lips) We've gotta sweeten the deal.
FRANCIS,"</b> Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, our troupe here guarantees a performance like no other! Why, when your grasshopper friends get here, we are gonna knock them dead!"
SLIM,</b> These folks are sure hard up for entertainment.
ANT KID,"</b> Come on, come on. Hurry!"
QUEEN,"</b> Honey, relax. You should be proud of yourself. Your instincts on that boy were right on the money."
QUEEN,</b> And to make our official welcome complete... Mr. Soil?
 SOIL,"</b> Yes, Your Highness?"
QUEEN,</b> He's our resident thespian. Last year he played the lead in Picnic.
 SOIL,"</b> The children, and myself, have quickly put together a little presentation in honor of our guests. Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?"
GYPSY,</b> Aren't they adorable! They're cute!
GIRL ANT,"</b> The South Tunnel Elementary School second-grade class would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn of you bugs helping us fight the grasshoppers away."
ROSIE,"</b> Oh, look at the beautiful colors of the blood."
DOT,</b> We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.
CIRCUS TROUPE,</b> (gasps)
HEIMLICH,</b> (whimpers)
 SOIL,"</b> I tell you a tale of heroes so bold, who vanquished our grasshopper enemies of old."
ANT BOY,"</b> Look, the last leaf has fallen."
ANTS IN GRASSHOPPER COSTUMES,</b> We are the grasshoppers! Where's our food?!
ANT BOY,</b> Who will come to save us poor ants?
ANTS IN WARRIOR COSTUMES,"</b> We are the warriors, here to defend you!"
ANT KID,</b> I die! Die! Die!
TUCK," Hey, hey, hey!"
FRANCIS, I say we go.
QUEEN," Okay, honey. You're up."
FLIK,"</b> Here, here."
ATTA,</b> (amplified) ...The warriors--
ANTS,</b> (laughing)
ATTA,</b> Thanks.
ATTA,"</b> (amplified) First of all, I'd like to thank the warriors for helping us in our fight against the grasshoppers."
ATTA,"</b> Secondly, I would like to thank Flik..."
ATTA,</b> ...For his forthright thinking--
FLIK,"</b> (amplified) Thank you, Your Highness. Sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but, well, that wouldn't be right. Because it was you, Princess Atta. You believed in me and you sent me on my quest."
SLIM,</b> You tell that ant that we need to talk to him right now.
ROSIE,"</b> Okay, okay. All right."
FLIK,"</b> Now, I know that I've made a lot of mistakes in the past. And I hope that this will make up..."
ROSIE,</b> (whispers) Flik!
FLIK,"</b> (quietly) Not right now, Rosie. I'm making a speech. (amplified) Now, I truly believe that these bugs are the answer to our..."
ROSIE,</b> (whispers)
FLIK,"</b> (quietly) No, there's no circus around here. (amplified) So I..."
FLIK,</b> (whimpers)
FLIK,"</b> Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus-- CIRCUMventing the oncoming hordes, so they can trapeze-- TRAP them with ease!"
ATTA,"</b> Shouldn't I come, too?"
FLIK,"</b> No! (laughs nervously) Sorry, no, you see, it's classified in the DMZ. Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!"
FLIK,"</b> Sorry. Sorry I have to take the warriors away so early, but, you know, they have a lot to get done, with the battle looming and all. So, please, everyone, enjoy the party."
ATTA,</b> B.Y.O.B?
FLIK,</b> Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.
FLIK,"</b> Okay, just... Just... Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!"
FLIK,</b> Circus bugs?! How can you be circus bugs?!
HEIMLICH,</b> What?
FRANCIS,"</b> Hey, hey, hey. You said nothing about killing grasshoppers, pal. You lied to us!"
FLIK,"</b> Are you kidding? Do you know what this is? This, my friends, is false advertising."
MANNY,"</b> How dare you! You, sir, are the charlatan in this scenario, touting your wares as a talent scout, preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes. Good day to you, sir."
FLIK,"</b> Wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go. You have got to help me. Give me some time. I'll come up with a plan."
HEIMLICH,</b> Just go tell them the truth!
FLIK,"</b> They can't... They can't know the truth. The truth, you see, is bad. I will be branded with this mistake for the rest of my life. My children's children will walk down the street, and people will point and say, ""Look! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!"" Oh... Oh, you know, all right, fine. Yeah, okay. Just go. But if you could just do me a little favor before you leave."
FLIK,"</b> If you could just squish me, that would be great, because when they find out, I'm as good as dead."
ATTA,</b> Flik!
FLIK,</b> Huh?
ATTA,</b> I really do think I should be part of this meeting. Flik!
FLIK,</b> Princess Atta! What a nice surprise.
ATTA,"</b> Just what exactly is going on? I would like to speak with the so-called ""warriors."""
FLIK,"</b> You can't! They are in the middle of a top-secret meeting right now, and they really should not be disturbed now. Right, guys?"
FLIK,"</b> (gasps) Could you excuse me, please?"
FLIK,"</b> Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!"
ATTA,</b> I'm not going anywhere. What is going on? Flik?
ATTA,</b> Flik! (groans) I knew it!
FLIK,"</b> Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!"
FLIK,"</b> No! No, no, no!"
SLIM,"</b> Quick, he's losing it!"
FLIK,</b> You can't go! I'm desperate!
SLIM,</b> Really? I couldn't tell.
DOT,</b> Hmm.
DOT,"</b> Come on, wings."
DOT,</b> (screaming) Help!
ATTA,"</b> Mother, Flik is up to something."
FLIK,</b> No! No!
SLIM,"</b> Okay, Flik, time to put you down now."
SLIM,</b> Get him off me. He's cutting off the circulation to my foot.
FLIK,"</b> No, no, no, no!"
SLIM,</b> Let go!
FLIK,"</b> Oh, please! Please! Don't go!"
ROSIE,"</b> Put the stick down. Flik, I mean it now. Drop the stick. Drop it."
FLIK,</b> Run!
HEIMLICH,"</b> Boy, he runs fast for a little guy."
BIRD,</b> (chirping)
 ROLL,</b> Tweet-tweet! Tweet-tweet!
ATTA,</b> This way.
ATTA,</b> There they are.
ATTA,</b> (gasp) A bird!
DOT,</b> (screams) Flik!
Queen, -Dot!
ADDA, -Dot!
Queen,-My baby!
FRANCIS, I gotcha! I gotcha!
QUEEN, I can't see!  Somebody do something!
SLIM, Are they all right?
HEIMLICH, Can anyone see?
ROSIE, I can't see!
SLIM, What is happening?
MANNY," Good heavens, they're in trouble!"
SLIM," Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis, Francis..."
flick," You guys, I've got an idea! "
ADDA, Here! I've got it!
DOT," Please, ma'am, wake up! Wake up! (DOT SCREAMS) Help! Help!"
HEIMLICH," Yoo-hoo! Mr. Early Bird! How about a nice, tasty worm on a stick?"
Slim, I'm going to snap. I'm going to snap.
HEIMLICH," Nice and juicy, succulent..."
FLIK, Let's go!
DOT, Flik! Help!
FLIK, Okay.
DOT, Flik!
FLIK,"-It's going to be okay, Dot."
HEIMLICH," Bye-bye, birdie! Help! I'm stuck! Pull me down! Schnell, schnell, schnell!"
ADDA, The caterpillar's using himself as live bait!
MR SOIL, How brave!
SLIM," Suck it in, man!"
FRANCIS, Ow! My leg!
DOT, Flik! (GASPS)
ROLL," Up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a! Up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a, up-a! (SCREAMS) (ALL SCREAMING)"
ROSIE, What is that?
MANNY," That, my friends, is the sound of applause!"
FRANCIS, Applause... I'm in heaven!
BLUEBERRY TROOP," Our Blueberry troop salutes you bugs for rescuing our smallest member, Princess Dot."
DOT, We voted you our honorary den mother!
FRANCIS, What? Great.
DR FLORA," All right, girls. Let's move your little keisters out of here now. The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on."
FLIK," Oh, sure."
ADDA," Again, thank you all very, very much."
HEIMLICH," Oh, stop. You're too kind."
ALL, Thank you.
ADDA," You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you?"
FLIK, You? No.
ADDA," Oh, good. Because, you see, when you first brought them here, I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns."
FLIK, You did?
ADDA," Don't tell them I said that. Boy, that's all I'd need, another royal blunder like that."
FLIK," Princess, you're doing a great job."
ADDA," Thanks. You're sweet. You're wrong, but sweet."
ADDA, I know what everyone really thinks.
FLIK, I don't follow you.
ADDA," Everyone, the whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job."
FLICK, Waiting for you to screw up.
ADDA," Flik, I owe you an apology."
FLIK, For what?
ADDA," Well, I haven't been that nice to you, and I'm sorry. If there's any way I can make it up to you... Hey! I know! How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs?"
FLIK, Me?
ADDA," Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport going with them, especially after that rescue. It was very brave."
FLIK," Really? No, no..."
ADDA," Well, not every bug would face a bird."
ADDA," mean, even Hopper's afraid of them."
FLIK," Yeah, well, I guess maybe I have..."
FLIK, Say that again?
ATTA," I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds."
FLIK, Thank you.
FLIK, Hopper's afraid of birds!
FRANCIS, And I don't blame him!
FLIK," Oh, oh, oh, this is perfect. We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up. You just keep pretending you're warriors."
ROSIE," Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, okay?"
FLIK, You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. It'll be easy. Here's what we do.
MANNY," Not another word. I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours, but we'll have no part of it."
VIOLET ANT BOY, Excuse me? Could we get the warriors' autographs?
HEIMLICH, Autographs? Yeah!
BLUE ANT BOY," -Oh, wow! Great!"
FRANCIS, So you fellas catch the action today?
BLUE ANT BOY, The bird went... and it just missed you!
GYPSY, Aren't you sweet?
VIOLET ANT BOY, And the way you pretended to be stuck in that huge crack!
HEIMLICH, That's just all part of the plan.
BLUE ANT BOY," Yeah, yeah."
BLUEANT BOY, And then you dive-bombed into the bush!
MANNY," There you go, my boy."
VIOLET ANT BOY, Wow! Thanks!
BLUE ANT BOY," ""Major..."""
MANNY," That's Major Manny, young cadet. I outrank everyone here, remember that "
MANNY, Dismissed!
VIOLET ANT BOY, Wow!
BLUE ANT BOY," When I grow up, I'm gonna be a praying mantis!"
VIOLET ANT BOY, I'm gonna be a stick bug!
BLUE ANT BOY," Oh, they're all so cool, I can't pick!"
MANNY," (CHUCKLES) Delightful lads. You were saying, Flik?"
FLIK," All right. We are going to build a bird, a bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be hoisted..."
MANNY," ...Hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree. Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below, we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers. Now it's going to take..."
ADDA," ...Everyone's involvement to make this plan a reality. I know it's not our tradition to do things differently, but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill, we can certainly rally together to build this bird!"
ADDA, Perfect!
ADDA," Okay, hit your marks!"
ADDA," (CHUCKLES) Hi, Flik."
FLIK, Oh?
DR FLORA," Oh, look. She's a natural mother."
FRANCIS," All right, that's it! Out! Out! Everybody out!"
FRANCIS," Now you're gonna cry, right? You're gonna cry. See if I care. Go ahead and cry. Go ahead."
FRANCIS," Please, don't cry. Please."
FRANCIS, Ta-da! (KIDS CHEERING)
BLUEBERY TROOP," Yeah, Francis!"
THORNY," Okay, lower, lower..."
TUCK," Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!"
ROOL," Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up!"
ROSIE," Rabbit through the hole, chicken in the barn, two by two by, there's the yarn."
ROSIE, Done!
ROLL, Ruben Kincaid!
ALL, Hey! Hey!
ATTA," Good job, guys! Nice work!"
HEIMLICH," Up, down. Up, down. Up, down."
FRANCIS, Huh?
HEIMLICH," Flik, watch out!"
HEIMLICH, Look! I'm a beautiful butterfly!
ADDA," There you go. Good job, fellas."
ADDA, Keep up the good work.
TUCK, You fired!
ROLL, You fired!
WATERSKIING GRASSHOPPER,</b> Look at me! I'm barefooting!
SUNBATHING GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Yo, bugito! Dos granitos, pronto!"
WATERSKIING GRASSHOPPER,"</b> You gotta try this, man!"
GRASSHOPPERS,"</b> La cucaracha, la cucaracha, da da da da da da..."
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> We have more than enough food, and if we go all the way back there and it starts to rain, we might as well be suckin' bug spray."
MOLT,"</b> Ooh! Don't even say that! You know somethin'? You're making a lot of sense. I mean, why take the risk? You should tell Hopper."
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Good idea! But, you know, it's really not our place. I mean, you're his brother. That makes you, like, uh... The vice president of the gang."
MOLT,"</b> Wow! It kind of does, doesn't it? Okay, I'll tell him. Boy, I should talk to you guys more often."
GRASSHOPPER,</b> What if Hopper doesn't like it?
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Then at least the genius will get smacked, and not us."
MOLT,"</b> Vice President Molt. Yeah, that's good. Oh, that's good."
HOPPER,"</b> A little lower. Lower, lower."
MOLT,"</b> Heya, Hop."
HOPPER,</b> Go away.
MOLT,</b> That's fine. Then I won't tell you my idea.
HOPPER,</b> Good!
MOLT,"</b> Okay, okay. I'll tell you anyway. You see, I've been thinking, okay, which is something that I do. You know, being vice president and all. And thi-this is a thought, and it was mine: why go back to Ant Island at all? I mean, you don't even like grain."
HOPPER,</b> What?!
MOLT,"</b> You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea, myself. Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was Axle and Loco's! They talked fancy to me. I got confused!"
HOPPER,"</b> Guys... Order another round, because we're stayin' here!"
HOPPER,"</b> What was I thinking? Going back to Ant Island. I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter, right? Why go back?"
HOPPER,</b> But...there was that ant that stood up to me.
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Yeah, but we can forget about him!"
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Yeah, it was just one ant."
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Ooh! One ant! 
HOPPER,"</b> (laughs) Yeah, you're right! It's just one ant!"
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Yeah, boss! Heh. They're puny!"
HOPPER,"</b> Hmm. Puny. Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant."
HOPPER,</b> Did that hurt?
GRASSHOPPER,</b> (chuckles) Nope.
HOPPER,"</b> Well, how 'bout this one?"
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Are you kiddin'?
HOPPER,"</b> Well, how 'bout this?"
GRASSHOPPERS,"</b> (screaming, fades)"
HOPPER,"</b> You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. That's why we're going back!"
HOPPER,</b> Does anybody else want to stay?
MOLT,"</b> He's quite the motivational speaker, isn't he?"
HOPPER,</b> Let's ride!
ANT, To the bird!
ALL, The bird!
ALL, (CHANTING) Hey!
DR FLORA," Get down, rolly boys!"
SLIM, How low can you go?
SLIM, How low can you go?
SLIM," Do it, princess. How low can you go?"
ROSIE," And that's how my 12th husband died. So now I'm a widow. I mean, I've always been a black widow, but now I'm a black-widow widow."
MR SOIL, Thorny! Any sign of those fiends?
THORNY, Let me check.
THORNY," No, not yet. But we'll be ready for them."
FRANCIS," Blueberries, dismissed! And quit beating the boys up. Those little raisins do grow on you."
FLIK," Hey, how you guys doing? Some party, huh? Is that grain dip fresh or what? Okay. I've told everyone you'll be stationed deep in the command bunker. Party quiets down, I sneak you out the back way, and then you're out of here forever."
ROSIE," Well, if Dim stays, he's gonna need me here. He's not fully trained. I mean, house-trained."
FRANCIS, I... I kind of promised the Blueberries I'd teach them canasta.
GYPSY, It seems we've been booked for an extended engagement.
ADDA, Will you look at this colony? Will you just look at this colony? I don't even recognize it.
CORNELIUS, I feel 70 again!
QUEEN," Work that ab, baby!"
ADDA," And I have you bugs to thank for it. So, thank you! And thank you for finding them, Flik."
FLIK, Me?
FLIK," Oh... I'll get it. I mean, if you don't mind, I'll just, I'll just... "
ADDA, It's all tangled up.
FLIK, There.
ADDA, I think I'll go check on the bird.
ADDA, Bird's this way.
FLIK," Yeah, the bird's that way."
THORNY, Jiminy H. Cricket!
FLIK, They're back!
ADDA," Get ready, everybody! Get to your posts!"
ADDA," Battle stations, everyone. This is not a drill!"
ADDA," Come on, everyone. You know your jobs!"
ADDA," et's go, go, go, go!"
ANT, Look out!
DIM, It's P.T.
CORNELIUS, Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?
FLIK," Nope! No, no, no. I'm sorry, no. I've never seen anyone like that around here."
SLIM, Be quiet!
FLIK, No one has ever seen anyone like that around here.
FLIK," So you'll probably want to get going. I guess you've got a lot of other anthills to check into, so bye!"
FRANCIS, P.T.!
 FLEA," I'm serious! Word of mouth got around. The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent, went on forever!"
ROSIE," P.T., no!"
ADDA," You mean, you're not warriors?"
THORNY, You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy was concocted by clowns?
FRANCIS, We really thought Flik's idea was gonna work.
FRANCIS, Oops.
ANNA, Tell me this isn't true.
FLIK," No, you don't..."
FEMALE ANT, We haven't collected any food for the grasshoppers!
THORNY, If Hopper finds out what we almost did--
QUEEN, Hopper is not going to find out. We're going to hide all this and pretend it never happened. You bugs were never here. So I suggest you all leave.
FLIK, But the bird! The bird will work.
QUEEN , I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself before the rest of his colony.
FLIK, What?
QUEEN ," The point is, Flik, you lied to us."
FLIK," No, no, no! I... I just..."
ADDA," You lied, Flik. You lied to her. You lied to the colony! You lied to me! And like an idiot, I believed you."
FLIK, But I... I was just afraid that if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...
FLIK, I just wanted to make a difference.
ATTA," I want you to leave, Flik. And this time, don't come back."
DOT, Flik!
ADDA, That's it? But there's got to be more food on the island!
THORNY,"  If we give up any more, we'll starve. "
ADDA, Hopper won't accept this!
ADDA," Mother, it's not enough. What do we do?"
QUEEN, I... I don't know.
HOPPER," You little termites! I give you a second chance, and this is all I get? (ALL SCREAM)"
ADDA," But, Hopper, we ran out of time!"
HOPPER, Have you been playing all summer? You think this is a game?
ADDA," No, no, please!"
hOPPER," Well, guess what? You just lost."
MOLT, Just do what he says. You don't want to make him mad. Believe me!
HOPPER," No, no, no."
HOPPER," You're staying with me, Your Highness."
GRASSHOPPER, Where do you think you're going? (ALL SCREAMING)
GRASSHOPPER, Get over there!
DOT, Quick! To the clubhouse.
DOT, (GASPS) Hurry!
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Shut up a minute, will you?"
GRASSHOPPER,</b> I think I heard something over here.
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Have you checked over there?
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> No, not yet."
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Well then, get over there and check it out!"
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Wait a minute.
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> Hey, I think I found something."
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> (chuckle) Cool. Hey, how do I look?"
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Like an idiot.
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> I don't know, maybe it'll keep me dry in the rain."
GRASSHOPPER,"</b> You moron! We'll be out of here before it rains. Didn't you hear Hopper? After the ants pick all the food, he's gonna squish the queen to remind them who's boss. Then she's dead, they cry, boo-hoo, we go home. End of story."
GRASSHOPPER,</b> Oh. Cool. I love our job.
DOT,</b> Stay here. I'm gonna get help.

FRANCIS, Here! Like this.
DOT, Flik!
FLIK, Dot?
DOT," Flik, wait! Wait!"
FLIK," Dot, you're flying!"
DOT, (PANTING) You have to go back.
HEIMLICH," Oh, no!"
MANNY, Good heavens!

HEIMLICH," Oh, not the queen!"
ROSIE, We got to do something!
SLIM, How?
ROSIE," Come on, you guys, think!"
GYPSY, I know. The bird.
MANNY," Yes, of course."
SLIM, The bird! That's brilliant.
FLIK, The bird won't work.
DOT, What are you talking about? It was your idea.
DOT, But you said that everything...
FLIK," Forget everything I ever told you. All right, Dot? Let's face it. The colony is right. I just make things worse. That bird is a guaranteed failure. (SIGHS) Just like me."
MANNY," You listen to me, my boy. I've made a living out of being a failure. And you, sir, are not a failure!"
ROSIE," Oh, but Flik, you've done so many good things."
FLIK," Oh, yeah? Okay, show me one thing I've done right."
DIM, Us.
MANNY," Dim is right, my boy. You have rekindled the long-dormant embers of purpose in our lives."
SLIM," And if it wasn't for you, Francis would have never gotten in touch with his feminine side."
FRANCIS," Oh, yeah?! Well... (CHUCKLES) You know what? He's right."
GYPSY, Lieutenant Gypsy reporting for duty.
FRANCIS," Kid, say the word, and we'll follow you into battle."
MANNY," We believe in you, my boy."
DOT,"</b> Flik, please?"
DOT,"</b> Pretend it's a seed, okay?"
FLIK,"</b> Thanks, Dot."
FRANCIS," Hey, what's with the rock?"
SLIM, Must be an ant thing.
FLIK,"</b> All right, let's do it."
GYPSY, That's the Flik we know and love.
MANNY, We're on!
ROSIE," So, what do we do first?"
 FLEA,</b> ♪ Bugs will pay big bucks to see a bonfire that is starring me! ♪
FRANCIS,"</b> P.T., look! Money!"
 FLEA,</b> Where? Where? (screams)
GRASSHOPPER, All right. Get moving! Get going.
FLIK,</b> They're rounding everyone up.
FRANCIS, Hey! Turn your butt off.
FLIK,"</b> Oh, no! They've finished collecting the food. We've got to get the queen now."
FLIK,"</b> Hello, kids! Ready to make some grasshoppers cry?"
DOT," It's payback time, Blueberry-style."
DOT, All right!
SLIM, Ladies and gentlebugs! Larvae of all stages! Rub your legs together for the world's greatest bug circus!
HEIMLICH, I think I'm going to wet myself.
FRANCIS, Steady.
HOPPER, What's going on here?
ADDA, Well...
SLIM, (CHUCKLES) Yes. We were invited by Princess Atta as a surprise for your arrival.
HOPPER, Squish them.
HOPPER, Now that's funny.
HOPPER," I guess we could use a little entertainment. Looks like you did something right for once, princess."
SLIM, On with the show!
MOLT," The circus, the circus, I love the circus"
HEIMLICH, ..all gone! Baby wants pie!
FRANCIS, Pie? He asked for it. Should I give it to him?
MOLT, Yeah! Give him pie! Give him pie!
MOLT, Yeah!
SLIM," Thank you, gentlemen. Always an intellectual treat. How many roaches does it take to screw in a light bulb? Can't tell. As soon as the light goes on, they scatter!"
FLIK, Almost there.
MANNY, From the most mysterious regions
FLIK,"</b> Come on, girls. Quick. Quick."
MANNY, ..of Metamorphosis!
MOLT, Pick me!
MANNY," Aha! Why, Your Majesty!"
QUEEN, Me?
HOPPER," No, no. Thumper, down. Let her go. Maybe he'll saw her in half."
MANNY," As you ascend the dung beetle to the unknown, put your trust in the mysteries that are beyond mere mortal comprehension."
HOPPER, This is gonna be good!
FLIK,</b> Blueberries ready?
FLIK, ALL: Ready.
BLUEBERRY TROOP, Ready!
MANNY, I call upon the ancient Szechuan spirits
FRANCIS," No, no."
MANNY, Transformation.
FRANCIS, Wow. Manny's getting good.
DR SOIL, (GASPS) Not now.
CORNELIUS," If it rains, that bird'll get ripped to shreds!"
MANNY," And now, insectus... transformatus!"
MOLT, Pretty!
MANNY," Thank you, thank you."
FLIK,"</b> That's the signal. That's the signal! This is it, girls. Get ready to roll."
BLUE ANT BOY, It's stuck!
MOLT, That was amazing!
MOLT, I have no... How did they do that?
MOLT, I have no idea where she went.
GYPSY," Thank you. Thank you, thank you."
GRASSHOPPERS, More! More!
HOPPER, Wait! Where is she?
MANNY," Well, now... Actually..."
GYPSY, I'm sorry. A magician never reveals his secrets.
MOLT," That's very true, Hoppy. I mean, where would the mystery be if we all knew how it was... Shutting up."
FLIK, You can do it! You've got to make it work!
VIOLET ANT BOY, Hey!
HOPPER," I said, where is she?"
MANNY, Ohh!
FLIK, Hold on!
HOPPER, Bird! It's a bird! (YELLING AND SCREAMING)
ADDA, Yes!
GRASSHOPPER, Let's get out of here! Go!
HOPPER, Don't let it get me! Don't let it get me!
GRASSHOPPER, Help me! Aaah! (LAUGHING)
DOT," Up, down, up, down. And turn!"
SLIM, My eye! Help me! (SCREAMS) (SCREAMS) Get out! (SCREAMING)
HEIMLICH, Hmm! Boysenberry!
FLIK," Huh? Aah! No, no, no, no, no! (GRUNTS) Aaah!"
MANNY," Oh, the pain!"
SLIM, No! P.T.! (YELLING)
DOT, Flik! Flik! Help us! (GROWLS)
ADDA, (GASPS) Dot!
FLIK, Okay! Everyone out! Hurry! (COUGHING)
ADDA, Where's Dot? Has anyone seen Dot? DOT: Aah!
HOPPER," Whose idea was this? Huh? Was it yours, princess?"
FLIK,"</b> Leave her alone, Hopper. The bird was my idea. I'm the one you want."
FLIK,</b> You were... You were gonna squish the queen.
FLIK,"</b> (weakly) You're wrong, Hopper."
FLIK,"</b> Ants are not meant to serve grasshoppers! I've seen these ants do great things. And year after year, they somehow manage to pick food for themselves and you. So who is the weaker species? Ants don't serve grasshoppers. It's you who need us."
FLIK,</b> We're a lot stronger than you say we are.
FLIK,"</b> And you know it, don't you?"
HOPPER," Well, princess!"
MOLT," Hopper? I hate to interrupt, but..."
HOPPER, You ants stay back!
MOLT," Oh, this was such a bad idea!"
ADDA," You see, Hopper, nature has a certain order. The ants pick the food, the ants keep the food and the grasshoppers leave! (ALL YELLING AND SHOUTING)"
ADDA," I'm so proud of you, Flik!"
HOPPER, Where are you going? They're just ants!
DOT, No! Bad grasshopper!
DOT, Yeah!
HOPPER," Come back here, you cowards! Don't leave!"
FLIK, To the cannon!
ALL, To the cannon!
FLIK,"</b> Happy landings, Hopper!"
FLIK, Rain! (SHOUTING AND SCREAMING) (SCREAMING)
ADDA, Flik!
SLIM, Quick! After them! 
FRANCIS, (YELLS) Slim!
SLIM, Francis! Francis!
FRANCIS, Where are you?
SLIM, I'm over here!
FRANCIS, Where?
SLIM, Here!
FLIK, Help! Help! Help!
HEIMLICH, Get him! (HOPPER YELLING) 
ROLL, Yes! Yes!
FLIK, No!
FLIK,</b> Go that way!
ATTA,</b> But the anthill's--
FLIK,</b> I've got an idea!
ADDA, Flik!
FLIK, Come on!
FLIK, There!
FLIK,</b> Come on! We've got to hide!
FLIK,"</b> No matter what happens, stay down!"
FLIK,</b> Hopper!
HOPPER, You think it's over?
FLIK,"</b> No, no, no! No, I can explain!"
HOPPER,</b> All your little stunt did was buy them time!
FLIK,"</b> No, please! Please, Hopper!"
HOPPER,"</b> I'll get more grasshoppers and be back next season, but you won't!"
BIRD,</b> (chirping)
HOPPER,"</b> Well, what's this? Another one of your little bird tricks?"
FLIK,</b> Yep.
HOPPER,"</b> Are there a bunch of little girls in this one, too? Hello, girls!"
BIRD,</b> (screams)
HOPPER,"</b> (yell) No! No! No, no, no, no!"
HOPPER,"</b> No! No! Oh, no!"
HOPPER,"</b> Oh, no! No, no, no!"
HOPPER,</b> (screaming)
THORNY,"</b> Come on, boys!"
ANT KID,"</b> Hey, Princess Dot! Wait up!"
QUEEN,"</b> I finally get a second to relax, and I got to get out of my chair. Come on! You can rub lotion on me later, shade boy."
CORNELIUS,"</b> Yeah, hubba-hubba."
CIRCUS TROUPE,"</b> Oh, thank you!"
MANNY,</b> Thank you.
GYPSY,</b> You're too kind.
SLIM,</b> The least we could do.
MANNY,</b> All in a day's work.
SLIM,</b> Any time.
ROSIE,</b> Dim!
DIM,</b> Oh...
ANT KIDS,</b> (moan)
ROSIE,"</b> I'm so sorry, kids. I wish you could come along, too."
BLUEBERRY ANTS,</b> (sobbing)
FRANCIS,</b> (quavering) I'm not gonna cry. I'm not gonna cry.
 ROLL,</b> (speaking foreign language)
 FLEA,"</b> Hey, let's go. We got a schedule to keep. Come on. Let's go."
CARTWHEELING ANTS,"</b> Hup, hup, hup, hup, hey!"
 FLEA,"</b> Hey, Tiny! Let's get this show packed up! We got paying customers hatching!"
MOLT,"</b> Yes, Mr. Flea. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. Right away, sir. And, um, I just wanted to thank you for giving me a chance, because it's an honor to work with creative giants such as yourself."
MOLT,</b> Shutting up.
 FLEA,</b> You sure you can't come on tour with us?
FLIK,</b> Sorry. My place is here.
ATTA,</b> (quietly) Good answer.
 FLEA,"</b> Oh, well. Your loss. One minute, insects!"
ATTA,"</b> I want to thank all of you for giving us back our hope, our dignity...and our lives."
SLIM,"</b> And to you, Princess Atta. You have given us so much. Please accept this gift from us bugs to you ants."
MANNY,</b> For you!
ATTA,</b> Oh! (chuckles) It's a rock.
CORNELIUS,</b> What's with the rock?
THORNY,</b> Must be a circus thing.
DOT,</b> (giggles)
ROSIE,"</b> Well, Flik, you really goofed up. (quavering) Thanks."
FLIK,"</b> (quavering) Yeah. You, too."
DOT,</b> (giggles)
 FLEA,</b> (sniffles) All right. Now it's getting mushy. We're out of here!
BLUE ANT BOY,</b> Whoa!
ROSIE,</b> See you next season!
SLIM,"</b> See you, Flik!"
GYPSY,</b> Bye! We miss you already!
TUCK,</b> You fired!
ROLL,</b> You fired!
SLIM,</b> (gasps) We forgot Heimlich!
HEIMLICH,"</b> I'm finished! Finally, I'm a beautiful butterfly!"
HEIMLICH,</b> (grunt)
HEIMLICH,"</b> Mein wings! Oh, they're beautiful!"
FLIK,</b> Heimlich! The wagon's taking off! You better start flying!
HEIMLICH,"</b> But I am flying! And from way up here, you all look like little ants!"
HEIMLICH,</b> Auf Wiedersehen!
FLIK,</b> Bye!
THORNY,</b> Present stalks!
THORNY,"</b> Harvester, salute!"
Penny, That one.
Shop owner," Here, boy. (picks him up and hands him to Penny."
Penny, (holds him) You're heavy. (the puppy licks her) And slobbery. (Penny puts a collar on the puppy that reads Bolt) There. You're a good boy. You're my good boy.
Penny, Hello?
s father," Penny, I don't have much time."
Penny, Daddy? Are you okay?
s father," Something's come up at work, honey. Daddy's not gonna be home for a while."
Penny, I... I don't understand.
s father," You can't go back to the house, Penny. Okay?"
Penny, What's happening?!
s father," It's all right. You won't be alone. You have Bolt. I've altered him. (Bolt is being experimented on to make him stronger, faster, and more powerful, unlike any other dog. A lightning bolt appears on his flank.) He can protect you now."
 Calico," The doctor has been taken care of, which, of course, is wonderful news. Everything is positioning nicely."
Penny, There he is. Dr. Calico.
Bolt, (growls)
Agent, Any luck getting our guest to spill his guts?
 Calico," Oh! His guts will spill, one way or another."
s father, Never! I'll never talk.
Cat, (hisses)
Penny, (gasp) Daddy!
 Calico," You're beginning to irk me, professor.<br/>I am irked, and that will not do. Has the package arrived? I think it might make our dear friend a bit more communicative."
Agent, I'm sending an agent to pick it up.
 Calico, Gorgeous! Have him bring it to me on the first flight.
Penny," Bolt, let's go!"
 Calico, We only need the girl.
Agent, What?
Penny, Where's Calico?
Agent, I'm talking to you.
Agent, Bolivia! Calico Bolivia! Near Lake Rogaguado!
Penny," Lake Rogaguado! I should've known. (Sees attack choppers flying in on them) Come on, Bolt. Let's go!"
Bolt, (drops the car)
Penny, (grabs her motor scooter and drives off while the choppers fly after them) Bolivia. There's a flight leaving in 10 minutes.
Penny," Bolt! Zoom, zoom!"
Penny," Bolt, fetch!"
Penny," Good boy. Airport. Uh-oh! (A whole battalion of Calico's minions charge after them both) Bolt, speak."
Bolt, (growls)
Penny," Okay, okay. Good job, buddy. Mission accomplished. (takes a selfie) That's a keeper. (Bolt continues to growl and bark) It's alright, tough guy. You got them all. Don't worry, Bolt. You saved the day again."
Director, Boom mike!?
Director, That's sloppy. The dog could've seen that. He could've seen that!
Mindy," Uh, who cares if the dog sees a boom mike?"
Director," Forgive me for answering a question with a question, but who are you?"
Mindy," Mindy Parker, from the network."
Director," Of course. Let me ask you, Mindy from the network, what do you see here?"
Mindy, Uh... the dog?
Director," ""The dog,"" she says. Oh, Mindy. Poor, poor, Mindy."
Mindy, Am I missing something here?
Director," You're missing everything, Mindy. You see a dog. I see an animal who believes with every fiber of his being, every fiber, that the girl he loves is in mortal danger. I see a depth of emotion on the face of that canine the likes of which has never been captured on screen before! Never, Mindy from the network! We jump through hoops to make sure that Bolt believes everything is real. It's why we don't miss marks. It's why we don't reshoot, and it's why we most certainly do not let the dog see boom mikes! Because, Mindy from the network, if the dog believes it, the audience believes it."
Mindy, Wow. Okay.
Penny," There. Perfect. You saved me again, Bolt."
Bolt, (There's banging outside and Bolt growls)
Penny," It's okay. It's nothing. No more bad guys. Do you want some food, Bolty? Are you hungry? (Puts some dog food in a bowl while accidentally dropping the cup. Bolt jumps) You got them, Bolt. No one's gonna hurt me. Bolt, look at me. I'm fine, see? Come here, buddy. Come here. (Tosses a ball) Go get it, Bolt. Go get it. Yeah, that one's no fun either. Well, what do we have here? Your old buddy, Mr. Carrot! (Squeaks)"
Bolt," (shows interest for a moment, but ignores it.)"
Penny," Bolt. You know I have to go. (Bolt nuzzles into her) Yeah, you're my good boy. (Goes out the door while Bolt whines)"
Agent, There she is. My little superstar. Let's get to that Teen Vogue cover shoot.
Penny," Mom, I wanna take Bolt home this weekend."
s mom," Well, I... That would be..."
Agent, That'd be nice. That'd be great. That would. A little girl and her dog. Nothing better than that.
Penny, So I can bring Bolt home?
Agent," As your friend, I say, ""Yes, absolutely,"" but as your agent, I have to remind you this is Bolt's world. He has to stay right here. Okay, let's go."
Penny," But he never gets to be a real dog, and it would only be for the weekend, and I just want..."
Agent," Well, you know what? It's a fair question. Let's do this, let's put a pin in it. Boop! Pin in. There you go. Now, let's let that hang there a bit, and then we'll address that when we've thought things through. Okay? Good enough for everybody? Smiles all around? Let's get out of here. Come on."
Penny, I don't need to think it through. I wanna take Bolt home.
Agent," Look at this face. I have a little girl at home, love of my life. I would do anything for her, and I would trade her for you in a heartbeat. True story. That reminds me, we need to be getting over to wardrobe."
Siamese cat, So the dog thinks this is all real?
Black cat," Oh, yeah, you're new. Guy never leaves the set. It's unbelievable. Whenever I get the chance, this is the perfect way to unwind. I like to start with an evil laugh. (looks down at Bolt and laughs evilly)"
Bolt," Hello, hairballs."
Black cat," You may have won today, Bolt, but in the end, we will get your little Penny."
Bolt," Not likely, cat, for you've chosen to follow the path of evil. Ultimately, it will destroy you, along with your fiendish puppet master!"
Siamese cat, Wow!
Black cat," I know, right? Okay, watch this. She's a goner, dog. The Green-Eyed Man has a plan, and soon, he will execute it."
Siamese cat," Yeah, and then he will execute her."
Black cat, Nice.
Bolt," I would super bark you both back into the hole you crawled out of, but I need you alive because I've got a little message for you to take back to your Green-Eyed Man. You tell him his old friend Bolt said he better--"
Black cat, Is it long?
Bolt, Is... Is what long?
Black cat, The message. Is it a long message? Because I have a horrible memory.
Bolt," Yeah, I'll make it brief, all right? You tell him I said I'm gonna--"
Black cat," You know what? Why don't we do this? You remember the first half of the message, and then I'll remember the second, and then we can pass it on to the Green-Eyed Man together."
Bolt," Now, I don't care how the message is translated, all right? Just do it, okay. Tell the Green-Eyed Man that I will not sleep, I will not rest until my Penny is safe from his evil clutches! You tell the Green-Eyed Man that reckoning--"
Black cat," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Way too many words. I was like, ""What?"" And then I was, like, ""Huh?"" And then, well, I got a little bored and... Something about clutches? Anyway, I'll do my best. Ciao."
Siamese cat," By the way, huge fan. Love it, love you. Gotta go. Thank you."
Bolt," Get back here, you sick, revolting, loathsome little-- (to the cats, it's just barking.)"
Black cat, Dogs.
Bolt," Cats... (sits down) I'll never let them get you, Penny."
Penny," Are you ready, Bolt?"
Bolt, (growls)
Director, Let's widen out camera three. Ready four. Go four! And driver.
Gaurd," (gets his helmet wiped clean) Thanks, Larry."
Director," All right, Scooter. Find the grate. Ready on the rubber bars. (Bolt bends through the bars) And track with them."
Penny," The Calico supercomputer. If we can access it, we'll finally learn where they're keeping my father. (Orders Bolt to go take care of the guards. Penny throws a coin to distract one of them while Bolt knocks them out)"
Penny," Bolt, stare!"
Penny, Nice move. (tries hacking into the computer) Come on. Come on.
 Calico, Such devotion. It brings tears to my eyes!
Penny, Calico!
 Calico, Your father's discoveries could be of great use to our organization. I'm sure he'll be more accommodating now that I've got his lucky Penny!
Penny, (gets captured) Bolt!
 Calico, World domination is within my grasp! (flies off laughing)
Director," How did your focus groups feel about cliffhangers? You ask for unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds, I give you unhappy 18-to-35-year-olds."
Penny," Bolt! It's okay, Bolt! I'm fine!"
Director," Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Guards, stop her!"
Penny, Bolt! Listen to him. He needs to know I'm okay.
Agent," Nope, you're not okay. You've been kidnapped by the fiendish Dr. Calico. At least that's what the dog needs to think, but just imagine, close your eyes and imagine how excited he'll be when he saves you tomorrow. Okay?"
Penny," But he's gonna be freaking out all night. Please, just let me--"
Agent," What... Wait a second, what's that behind your ear? Is that a... Yes, it is, it's a pin. Let's do this. Let's take the pin and put it in this conversation. Boop! And we will not take it down, no, ma'am, until this matter is resolved."
Penny, But I just--
Agent, Do you know what that reminds me of? The DVD release junket. Let's get going.
Siamese cat, I've been working on my evil laugh. 'Cause everybody has an evil laugh. (Makes an odd noise) Like that.
Black cat," Okay, here's the thing. You're not ready for the evil laugh. You could do a chuckle, like a mildly upset chuckle, after my evil laugh. Listen to mine. (cackles maniacally) Hey, Bolt."
Bolt, (looks at the supercomputer) I'm too late.
Penny," Bolt, help!"
Bolt," I'm coming Penny Hold on, Penny! Hold on!"
Bolt," Okay, Bolty! Okay. Stay cool. You're cool, Bolty. (Runs around town to find Penny until he sees a man that looks like Dr. Calico from behind.) The Green-Eyed Man. (tries headbutting the fence but gets bounced back. He goes through the fence and tries to knock out the man. But it doesn't work. He sees that it's not the green-eyed man.) Penny! Penny! (Runs across town to find her. He tries jumping over sidewalk construction only to fall in. He comes out with a cone on his head. Through the hole, he sees a symbol that looks like the Green-eyed man's) Penny! Target acquired!"
Bolt, It ends here.
Bolt, Penny! Penny? They moved her.
Bolt," There's no time for formalities, brothers. My person's in danger, and I... (one dog sniffs his butt) Whoa! What are you doing?"
Small dog, Oh! I'm sorry. You wanna sniff mine first?
Bolt, What? (another dog sniffs his butt)
Big dog," Not from around here, are you?"
Bolt," Hey, stop it! This is serious! (the dog walker puts him on a leash)"
Dog walker," Hey there. Are you lost, sweetie? (Bolt runs off) Hey! Wait!"
Bolt, (Runs off and gets his head stuck in the bars. He looks up to see he's lost in the city. He tries to pull his head out.) Why can't I bend these stupid bars?
Vinny," Oh, buddy. You got your head stuck pretty good, huh, guy? Hey, guys, come here. Check this out. He's got his melon stuck."
Joey," Yup, that is one stuck melon."
Bolt, (tries yanking himself out)
Vinny," Hey, hey, buddy. Take it easy. Slow down."
Bolt," I will not take it easy, pheasant. I'm missing my person."
Vinny," Hey, buddy, relax. Like this. Turn and pull. Turn and pull. Forget about it. You'll be out, no time."
Bolt, (Twists and pulls his head out) What are these things? They've weakened me.
Vinny, Oh! Those are Styrofoam packing peanuts.
Bolt, Styrofoam? This has the Green-Eyed Man written all over it. Have you seen the man with the green eye?
Vinny," You know, I gotta say something, if I could say something here. You look familiar. Joey, look at this guy's mug."
Joey," Yeah. You know, I could've sworn I've seen this guy before."
Bobby," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
Vinny," I gotta tell you, I never forget a face."
Joey, He never does.
Bobby," Oh, yeah, yeah. Yeah, he's real good with the faces and such."
Bolt," Listen, listen! The man with the green eye, tell me what you know, birds!"
Vinny, I know this dog.
Bobby," Yeah, yeah, me too!"
Vinny," I gotta remember. It's gonna kill me. Hold on. (a bus with Bolt's logo drives by.) No, I don't know. I thought I knew."
Bobby," Hey, you ever hang out down on 14th Street with a stray named Kelvin?"
Joey," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kelvin, the Labradoodle."
Bolt, What?
Vinny," You gotta give me something here,<br/>'cause this is ridonculous."
Bobby, Absolutely ridonculous.
Vinny," Capisce, ridonculous. You know what that means?"
Bolt," (sighs) You pigeons are useless. I need someone on the inside, someone close to the Green-Eyed Man. A cat."
Vinny, Oh... A cat?
Bolt," Yeah, a cat. And when I find him, ooh, when I find him, I'm gonna make that cat wish he were never born."
Vinny, (Smirks) I think we know just the cat.
Mittens," Right on time, Saul. Come on in. (Saul lays a bit of hot dog down) Okay, Saul, nice work. Let's find some mustard next time. Okay, babe?"
Saul," Yes, Mittens. Thank you, Mittens."
Mitten," Ooh! Is that an everything bagel, Ted? Attaboy."
Ted," Good day, Mittens."
Louie, (lays down a single seed but gets caught)
Mittens, Louie? What is this?
Louie," Well, It was a slow week. That's half of what I got."
Mittens," (Stomach starts growling) You hear this, Louie? I'm starving here. And when the old stomach starts talking, it ain't talking to me. It's talking to the claws."
Louie, Not the claws! Please!
Mittens," I'm holding these bad boys back, best I can, but the thing is, it's not up to me. The stomach's got a direct line to these babies, and I'm picking up a lot of chatter. So, I'll talk to the claws, but in exchange, next week all your food comes to me."
Louie," But that's not our deal. I bring you half, you give me protection. That's our deal."
Mittens," Yeah, well, the deal just expired. Now get lost."
Louie," Mark my words, Mittens. One day someone's gonna stand up to you. Someone's gonna teach you a lesson."
Mittens, Yeah. I'm really scared now. (gets tackled)
Bolt, You should be!
Mittens, (screaming) Okay! Yeah!
Bolt, Where is she?
Mittens, Uh... Who?
Bolt, You know why I'm here. Where is she?!
Mittens," Okay, okay. Look, buddy, I don't know what you're getting at, but--"
Bobby, (laughing)
Vinnie," Come on, Mittens. Just tell the guy where she is. Tell the dog, make him happy."
Bobby," Yeah, yeah, come on, Mittens. Tell him!"
Joey, (laughs)
Mitten," Joey, Vinnie, Bobby, my boys! Would you tell the crazy canine that he's got the wrong cat?!"
Vinnie, ... You got her pal!
Joey, She's the one!
Vinnie, That's her!
Joey, That is definitely the right cat.
Mittens, (looks scared) Heh.
Bolt, Looks like we're gonna do this the hard way.
Mittens," (screams) Whoa! Hey, you're crazy, man!"
Vinnie," ... Hey, Joey. Did you go too far in this?"
Joey, You kidding? This is the best day of my life.
Bolt," You work for the men in black, who work for the man with the green eye. They've taken Penny. Where is she?"
Mittens, I don't know what you're talking about.
Bolt," This is becoming tiresome, cat. In fact, I feel a yawn coming on."
Mittens," Okay! Okay! Okay! Okay, I'll talk! I'll talk! I know where Penny is. Yeah. They have her. Yes! The men in black and the guy, the guy with the blue eyes!"
Bolt, Blue eyes?
Mittens," Um... Oh! Green! Yes, green! The one green eye!"
Bolt," You just can't stop lying, can you, cat? It's in the genes. It's just gross."
Mittens," I know. It's disgusting. I disgust myself. (Sees Bolt's collar) Hollywood. But if you put me down, I'll show you where she is."
Mittens," (digging in the trash) You know, I hope you appreciate the risk I'm taking here. Every bone in my evil cat body is telling me not to betray the trust of the Green-Eyed Man. Okay. This is a top, top-secret map of the entire Earth. Now we're over here, by the green lady with the big torch, and my boss has Penny locked up... Uh... Right... Right over... Here, here! By the waffle with the sunglasses. Now all you need to do is get from here to there. Well, I told you where to find her so if you'll just untie me, I'll be on my way."
Bolt," I'll release you, cat, when we find Penny."
Mittens, Excuse me? That wasn't the deal. We had a deal!
Bolt, Your deal just expired.
Louie, She said that to me not 10 minutes ago. (chuckles) The irony.
Bolt, Ooh! Perfect. (the trunk is locked) Hmm. Padlocked. (stares at it)
Mittens," (keeps yanking) Listen, Cujo, I got some pretty wicked claws under these mitts. Do not, I beg of you, do not make me bring out these bad boys. It gets ugly... What are you doing?"
Bolt," Stay back! If I stare at the lock really hard, it'll burst into flames and melt."
Mittens, ... Now I'm concerned on a number of levels.
Bolt, (hears others) Intruders!
Mittens, (gets yanked) Slow down! You're scraping the fur off my-- (faceplants into a mailbox and passes out.)
Vinnie," It's on the tip of my tongue. I know that dog. I'm telling you, Joey. Bobby, you guys are looking at me like, ""Heh, I don't know."" Telling you, I know this dog. I've seen him somewhere."
Joey," Hey, you'll remember it tonight when you're preening."
Vinnie," Right, that's what'll happen."
Agent, I have got some good news.
Penny, (gasp) Really?!
Agent," Yes, I do. I just booked you on The Tonight Show, lead guest. (Penny sighs sadly) That's right... Which means just absolutely nothing if Bolt is still missing. It's not even good news, like, ""Whatever,"" ""So what?"" The Tonight Show, who cares? I don't care."
s mom," Aw. It's okay, baby."
Penny, He must be so scared.
s mom," Scared? Well, this is Bolt we're talking about. He's not scared of anything."
Agent, I bet Bolt would want you to do The Tonight Show. (The mother sneers at him) Or maybe not. (squeaks Bolt's carrot squeaky toy.)
s mom," Bolt loves you very much, sweetie, and you're here. He couldn't have gone far."
Mittens," So, if you got superpowers, I guess that would make you, what, like, some kind of superdog?"
Bolt, That information's classified.
Mittens," Aw, come on. Like, what's your best power? Your go-to move. How about flying? Can you fly?"
Bolt, Don't be silly. I can't fly.
Mittens," Okay, okay, fine. If you don't have any powers, you don't have any powers. What's it to me?"
Bolt, ... I have a superbark.
Mittens, A superbark? Wow! You're kidding me. (Sees a bat) What exactly does one do with a superbark?
Bolt, I really can't talk about it. It's classified. So I suggest you pipe down and take me to Penny.
Mittens," You're awfully attached to this Penny character, huh, Wags?"
Bolt, She's my person.
Mittens," Oh, please. She's a person. And if you ask me, the only good person is a-- (falls backwards while knocking over one of the boxes. It spills styrofoam all over Bolt.)"
Bolt, Styrofoam! (opens the door) Tuck and roll!
Mittens, Tuck and what?!
Bolt, Ow! (looks at his paw) What? What is this red liquid coming from my paw?
Mittens," It's called blood, hero."
Bolt, Do I need it?
Mitten," Yes! So if you wanna keep it inside your body, where it belongs, you should stop jumping off trucks doing 80 on the interstate!"
Bolt," Yeah, well, normally, I'm a tad more indestructible. Must've been the... (gasp) Styrofoam! That stuff, it weakens me."
Mittens, (Grabs it) Ah-ha!
Bolt, What are you doing? Put that down!
Mittens," All right, that's it. I've had it with you. Untie me, pooch. Or I'm gonna... I'm gonna... I'm gonna seriously wound you! I'm gonna seriously wound you with this Styrofoam."
Bolt, Are you mad? You don't know the power of Styrofoam!
Mittens," Oh, you bet I'm mad, baby, and I'm about to unleash it. The power of the Styrofoam."
Bolt," Whoa! All right, cat! Okay. You win. I'll untie you... That's a weird place to put a piano. (smacks the styrofoam out of Mittens' paw.) Are we gonna have any more problems, cat?"
Mittens," No! No, no. No more problems. I'll take you to Penny."
Bolt, (sniffs the air and his stomach starts to growl.) Ah! What is that?!
Mittens, What?
Bolt," (Stomach growls) That! Okay. You have two seconds to tell me what you've implanted in me, cat! Poison? A parasite? Poison? Oh, no, I just said that, didn't I? See, I'm all discombobulated. I can't think straight."
Mittens, I don't believe this. You're hungry.
Bolt, (Stomach growls) Where is the antidote?!
Mittens," Okay, okay! All right."
Mittens," There's your antidote. Food. Go on, use the dog face. This is gonna be beautiful... You know, beg... Do the dog face!"
Bolt, What... The dog face? What does that mean?
Mittens," Figures I'm tied to the one dog on Earth who doesn't know how to beg. Okay, if you want the... The antidote, you're gonna have to do exactly what I say."
Bolt, No. Not likely. You're a degenerate creature of darkness.
Mittens," Yeah, yeah. Granted. But, that said. All I'm asking you to do is just tilt your head a little. You can do that, can't you? Come on. (Bolt tilts his head) More. (tilts) More."
Bolt, This is stupid!
Mittens," No, no, no, come on. Work with me on this, please. You're almost there."
Bolt, Oh boy. (tilts his head)
Mittens," Okay. Try it the other way... There you go. Tilt up... Down... Now a little smile... Lose the smile... Drop your left ear. Your other left. Okay, the other way was better. Now drop them both. Hold it. Right there. And ever so slightly, look up... Soup is on, baby!"
Old lady," Well, hello, puppy. Did you come for some of Grandma's butter bean dumplings? Mmm-mmm. You wait right there."
Mittens," Look at you. You are quite the little actor, huh? I haven't eaten like this in ages. Hey, look, my stomach's distended! How great is that?"
Bolt," Yeah, well, don't get used to it. We gotta keep moving."
Mittens, But this place is a gold mine. What's wrong with you? Every week new RVs bring us new suckers who bring us new food. Look around! It's perfect.
Rhino," (Gasp) Do my eyes deceive me? Is this some apparition I see before me? Or could it be my hero? Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh! You're Bolt, the Superdog! You're fully awesome!"
Mitten, Wait a minute. You know this dog?
Rhino, I do. He is fully awesome.
Mitten," Yeah, yeah, yeah. We've established that. Who are you?"
Rhino, I'm Rhino.
Mitten, Rhino... The hamster?
Rhino," Well, you know, my ancestry isn't all hamster. I'm one-sixteenth wolf with, you know, a little wolverine in there somewhere, but that's besides the point. We have before us a legend, Bolt, the Superdog. He can outrun speeding missiles and burn through solid metal with his heat vision. Oh! And best of all, he can obliterate large structures with his superbark!"
Mittens, Wait a minute. You've seen the superbark?
Bolt, Have you been observing me?
Rhino," Oh, yeah! I watch you all the time."
Bolt, That's incredible.
Rhino," Oh, it's nothing, really."
Bolt, But I'm always so vigilant. No one can evade my detection. You're a phantom.
Rhino," Uh... If you say so. Hey, check it out. Take a gander at this Bolt action. Scary, huh? It's like we're twins."
Mittens, Yeah... Scary...
Rhino," So, where's Penny?"
Bolt, She was kidnapped by the Green-Eyed Man.
Rhino, Kidnapped? (gasp) This is terrible! She could be in grave--
Bolt, Grave danger. I know. But I've captured this cat.
Rhino," An agent of the Green-Eyed Man, I presume?"
Bolt, You presume correctly. She's taking me to Penny.
Rhino," You, you are vile vermin. How do you sleep at night? Penny's the most wonderful person ever, and she loves Bolt. And he's awesome, and you're a monster! How dare you disrupt their relationship with your evil! Die! Die!"
Rhino," I can take her, Bolty! Let me at them! Die! Die!"
Bolt," Easy, easy, Rhino. Easy."
Rhino, You're right. We need her alive.
Mitten," Uh... ""We,""?"
Rhino," Yes! Bolt, I can be a valuable addition to your team."
Bolt, I'm listening.
Rhino," I'm lightning-quick. I have razor-sharp reflexes, and I'm a master of stealth. Plus, I'll keep the cat in check."
Bolt, The road will be rough.
Rhino, I have a ball.
Bolt, There's no turning back.
Rhino, Guess I'll have to roll with the punches.
Bolt, Easy won't be part of the equation.
Rhino, Promise!?
Bolt," I gotta warn you. Going into the belly of the beast, danger at every turn."
Rhino, I eat danger for breakfast.
Bolt, You hungry!?
Rhino, (cracks his neck) Starving!
Bolt, Welcome aboard!
Rhino, (cheers)
Mittens," Hey. Can we talk for a second? I don't know what's going on here, but I'm just a little bit concerned about the number of lunatics on this trip. My limit is one."
Bolt, He's coming with us.
Mittens, But I... (Gets kicked by Rhino)
Rhino," Move it, prisoner. We're losing daylight."
Bolt," I agree. Now, we need to find a fast set of wheels."
Rhino, (Gasp) I've got a better idea. Follow me. (sings happily)
Bolt," Okay. So what we do here is we give the target a quick flyover, we adjust the trajectory and then land dead center. Am I missing anything, Rhino?"
Rhino, Just the knowledge that every minute spent in your company becomes the new greatest minute of my life.
Mittens," (Struggling to get away and has a bucket on her head.) No! Forget it! How do you say, ""No way I'm doing this"" in crazy?"
Bolt," Calm down, cat. You're with me."
Mittens, That's the problem!
Rhino," Would you relax? Every time he did this on the magic box, it was awesome!"
Mittens, ... Magic what?
Rhino," You know, the magic box people stare at."
Mittens, Wait a minute. Does this magic box have moving pictures on it?
Rhino," Yeah, and Bolt's pictures are the best."
Mittens," Bolt's pictures. Of course! He's from a-- (gets yanked over the edge) Oh, no! Oh, no. No, wait, wait. Bolt, dog, hear me out."
Rhino, Let it begin. Let it begin! LET IT BEGIN!!!
Mittens, Wait! You are not a superhero--
Bolt," Mittens! Mittens, take my paw! I need you alive!"
Mittens, You're crazy! Stay away from me!
Bolt, Take my paw! I'll save you!
Mittens," No, you won't! You're not really a--"
Rhino, Bolt! (Sees Mittens at the ladder) Saboteur! (Attacks her)
Mittens," Ouch! You moron, stop it! I'm trying to help him!"
Rhino," Help him? Yeah, right. Don't worry, Bolt. I'll stop her!"
Mittens, I can't hold it!
Rhino," Let go, you monster!"
Mittens, Bolt!
Bolt, (Gets up and limps.) Ow. Ow.
Mittens," The real world hurts, doesn't it? But you wouldn't know about that, would you?"
Bolt," Get down here, cat. We don't have time for this."
Rhino, I'll get a ladder.
Mittens," Look, genius, you're part of a TV show. You know what that is? Television? It's entertainment for people. It's fake. Nothing you think is real is real!"
Bolt, That's preposterous!
Mittens," Think about it, Bolt. Since you got lost, none of your powers are working, are they? For the first time, you're hungry, you're bleeding. I mean, do you really think that you were born with a birthmark in the exact shape of a lightning bolt?"
Bolt," It's my mark of power, cat!"
Mittens," It's the mark of a makeup artist, dog."
Bolt, You're ridiculous. Now get down here.
Mittens, (ties herself up) No.
Bolt," Mittens, so help me, I will superbark you out of that tree."
Mittens, Yeah. Go nuts. Let's see how that works out for you.
Bolt, You leave me no choice. (Takes position and barks. Nothing happens.)
Mittens," Oh, the superbark. Scary, scary. Yeah, that's really, really super."
Bolt, It's not true. It's just not true! (Huffs and puffs and barks. Nothing happens.)
Mittens," Wow. That one felt really super. Wait. No, it didn't."
Bolt, (Starts barking incessantly)
Mittens," Okay, okay. Mmm-hmm. I get the idea. You could stop now... That's enough... Seriously, dog, stop. I'm not kidding. Would you stop? It's... (Sees the animal catcher) Okay, fine! You're a superdog. Bolt, be quiet, please! Bolt, we gotta run! (The animal catcher snags Bolt) Bolt!"
Agent," Look who we found, young lady. It's Bolt! They found him!"
Penny, Bolt!
Agent," Yeah, that's right. The little puppy dog."
Penny, That is NOT Bolt.
Agent," Well, that depends on how you look at it. You know, when I was little, I wanted a bicycle for my birthday, but my parents got me a baseball glove. So, you know what I did? I pretended that baseball glove was a bicycle, and I rode it to school every day... True story."
Penny, It's not him!
Agent," Uh, I think it's him. I do."
Mindy," (Ahem) Thank you. Look, kid. It's time we were honest with you. If we don't get back into production, people are going to lose their jobs. Good people, with families."
Penny," But Bolt's still out there, and--"
Mindy," Now, we feel for you, and the last thing we wanna do is ask a little girl to make a grown-up decision, but it's come to that. We need you to move on. We need you to let Bolt go."
Bolt, Must be made of styrofoam.
Mittens," No, no! No, no, no, please, please, it can't end like this!"
Bolt," Stop worrying, cat! I'll get us out of here."
Mittens," You can't, Bolt! You got nothing! No super strength, no superbark... And no heat vision. (Bolt is staring at the door, hoping to melt it.) Listen to me, okay? We are being taken to a place where humans go animal shopping, all right? And this is what humans do. They always pick the cute ones. The ones that look like you, Bolt. But the rest of us never come back out."
Bolt," I said I'll get us out of here, all right? (Headbutts the door, but knocks himself out.)"
Mittens, My hero...
Rhino," (Follows the truck all the way to the gas station.) Ring, ring. Who is it? Destiny? I've been expecting your call. (Opens his ball up and steps out. He climbs up the truck to open the door Bolt is in.)"
Bolt, (Slams against the door) Owwww.
Mittens, Would you give it up already? You're liquefying whatever brains you have left.
Bolt, I cannot be contained in any container. You quitter. Watch this! (Rhino opens the door as Bolt headbutts it. He falls out into the grass.) I did it! I'm back! That styrofoam is wicked stuff.
Rhino, Fully awesome! There's no truck that I know that can keep in Bolt and Rhino!
Bolt, Rhino? What are you doing here?
Rhino," Oh, nothing. I was enjoying an evening stroll and thought I'd just pop the hatch on that containment unit!"
Bolt, Y-you... You opened the door?
Rhino," Yes, I did! Yoink!"
Bolt," That's great, Rhino. Yeah, that's really good."
Rhino, All right. Let's go get the prisoner back.
Bolt, (Stops to look at the lighting bolt on his side. It smears off on his paw.) I... I can't do it...
Rhino, (Stops) What did you say?
Bolt, I can't...
Rhino, Who are you?!
Bolt," Rhino, you just don't under--"
Rhino, You are Bolt!
Bolt, But I'm not a--
Rhino, Who singlehandedly destroyed the Green-Eyed Man's undersea labs?
Bolt," Me, but--"
Rhino," And who foiled his plan to infiltrate the Olympics with gymnastic cyborgs? Who, Bolt, who? Who?"
Bolt," Me, but none of it was--"
Rhino," You! You can, Bolt, because all over this planet, there are animals who feel like they can't. Like a little hamster who once spent his days in an RV park, dreaming of the day when he, too, would save a little girl from danger and be told, ""You did it. You did it, Rhino. You saved the day."" They need a hero, Bolt. Someone who, no matter what the odds, will do what's right. They need a hero to tell them that sometimes the impossible can become possible if you're awesome!"
Bolt," Well, you're right about one thing, Rhino. Mittens does need a hero...  (Exhales) And I guess I'll have to do."
Rhino," Such modesty! Now, who's going to save that cat?"
Bolt, Me.
Rhino, Who? Tell me who!
Bolt, Me!
Rhino, (squeals with laughter) I'll get my ball.
Bolt, Over there. (looks over) There it is.
Rhino," (Huffs heavily, fogging up his ball.) This'll be just like the time you<br/>infiltrated Calico's Arctic hover-base!"
Bolt," But it's not gonna be exactly like that, Rhino. We're gonna have to do things a little differently."
Rhino," Ooh, stealth mode. (draws a smile)"
Lloyd," Good night, Ester."
Ester," Good night, Lloyd. (The doors close... And then open back up.) Lloyd? (looks around) Lloyd Spoon, you jump out and scare me, and I'm gonna pepper-spray you again! I swear, it's like I work with toddlers."
Rhino, Threat nullified. (Getting excited) I feel alive!
Bolt," (Cover's Rhino's ""mouth"") Shh! (Looks to the cat room) There's a guard."
Rhino, I'll snap his neck.
Bolt, We need to get him away from that door.
Guard," I'm just... I'm read... I'm just... Aw, just pipe down!"
Bolt, Mittens?
Mittens, Bolt? What are you doing here?
Bolt, I'm busting you out.
Mittens, You... You came all the way back here for me?
Bolt, Yeah.
Mittens," But how'd you... I mean, you don't have any superpowers."
Bolt, I know.
Mittens, Really?
Bolt, Yeah.
Mittens," Wow. Crazy day for you, huh?"
Bolt," It's been a lot. Yes, it has. Are you ready for this?"
Mittens, No.
Bolt, Me neither. (Opens up the cage.)
Guard," Hey, hey, hey! What is twisting your giblets? Hey, wait. Where'd you get that hamster? Give it. Give it. (Bolt barks) Hey, wait! (Jumps at him)"
Rhino, Initiating escape! (Spins his ball super fast until the dog spits him out. The ball is covered in slobber.)
Guard," Hey! Lloyd! Block the door! Block the door, block the door, block the door!"
Rhino, Superbark. Superbark!
Ester, Sweet Sister Frances! What did you do to my new truck?!
Guard, You hold on right there!
Ester, (Pepper sprays him)
Guard," (screams in pain) Golly, Ester!"
Ester, Both you boys need serious help!
Guard, Spicy eyes!
Bolt, We need a ride.
Rhino, Ooh! I've got a big one. You're welcome.
Rhino," I can't believe it! My whole life, I've wanted to see a real live superbark! (Chuckles in excitement) You are legendary!"
Bolt," (Sits down sadly) Mittens? If... If I don't chase bad guys, then what am I? I mean, what..."
Mittens," Ah, don't worry about it. Being a regular dog is, like, the greatest gig in the world. Okay? Look. I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, okay? A little-known cat secret. You know why we hate dogs? 'Cause we wanna be dogs. We have dog complexes."
Bolt, But... But what do dogs do?
Mittens," Slobber, sleep, chase tails, chew shoes. You don't exactly need a master's degree. You know, most dogs live in a place like this, and, well, I don't know. They do things like... (Takes Bolt to the toilet)"
Bolt, Out of this?! But... But...
Mittens, And this is your dog bowl.
Bolt, What is?
Mittens," This. The entire floor. ""It hits the ground, it goes to the hound."" How cool is that? And on cold nights, this and a ball of yarn... It doesn't get better than that."
Bolt," You, uh... You seem to know a lot about these places."
Mittens," Yeah, I did my time in one of these, but I'm more of an alley cat at heart, you know? Sprung out first chance I got. Never looked back."
Bolt, Hmm...
Rhino, Rhino is awesome! He's so awesome! He's... He's beyond awesome! He... He's be-awesome! He's ah! (Sees Bolt and Mittens.) I...  Am be-awesome.
Bolt, (Sniffs at the vent. He likes the cool breeze.)
Mittens, I think it's about time I introduced you to the regular dog piece de résistance. (Takes Bolt to the window) Go ahead. Stick your head out.
Bolt, Why?
Mittens, Just do it.
Bolt, (Sticks his head out the window. He gets excited about the wind in his face.) Whoa! This... This is awesome!
Mittens, And stick your tongue out.
Bolt, (Sticks his tongue out. He's enjoying himself.) This is totally awesome! Why don't you try it?
Mittens," No, thanks. It's really a dog thing."
Mittens," Hey. Hey, Bolt. Wake up. Come on. I've got a surprise for you. (Takes Bolt to the neon dump.) Okay, okay. No peeking. All right, now, open them. Bask in the glow, baby."
Bolt, I... Uh...
Mittens," Just let me give you the grand tour. Okay? This one, this one's mine, and this one is all yours."
Bolt," Mittens, I--"
Mittens," I found this really soft pillow thing for you. And get this. I found some styrofoam, and I stuffed it inside, which I thought was both kind of creative and ironic. You know what I mean?"
Bolt," Mittens, I don't think that--"
Mittens," oh! Ooh! Check it out. (Kicks the stick away) Total privacy, and completely soundproof!"
Bolt," Yeah, well, I don't think that I--"
Mittens," Okay, I lied. It's not soundproof. But you know--"
Bolt," Mittens, I can't stay here!"
Mittens, What?
Bolt, We're one waffle away from Penny.
Mittens, You're still going back to her?
Bolt," Mittens, she's my person."
Mittens, (Gets mad and grabs Bolt by the ear.)
Bolt," Ow! Ow! Ow! Ear, ear."
Mittens," (Jumps up and show's him a billboard of his show.) Look at me, Bolt. I'm real."
Bolt, Not Penny.
Mittens, There is no Penny. She's fake.
Bolt," No, you're wrong. She loves me."
Mittens," No, no, Bolt. That's what they do, okay? They act like they love you, they act like they'll be there forever, and then one day they'll pack up all their stuff and move away and take their love with them, and leave their declawed cat behind to fend for herself! They leave her wondering... What she did wrong."
Bolt," I... I'm sorry, Mittens, but Penny is different."
Mittens, ... Then go...
Bolt," Mittens, I..."
Mittens," Get out of here, Bolt! I never should've taken pity on you."
Bolt, Mittens...
Mittens," Just get out of here, Bolt!"
Bolt," (Starts to walk away) You take care, Mittens."
Rhino, (Groans) That meat lover's pizza is not loving me back at all.
Mittens," Hey there, Rhino."
Rhino," Morning, cat... Where's Bolt?"
Mittens, He's... Uh... He's gone.
Rhino, Bolt... Left?
Mittens," Yeah, but he instructed me to tell you that he had to face the Green-Eyed Man alone."
Rhino, (Wanders off)
Mittens, Whoa! Where are you going?
Rhino, To Bolt.
Mittens, But he doesn't need us anymore.
Rhino," Trust me, I've seen it a million times before. In the cold, dark night before the battle, when the steely fangs of evil are sharpened and poised to strike, the hero must go and face his greatest challenge alone. But if Bolt's taught me anything, is that you never abandon a friend in a time of need. When your teammate's in trouble, you go. Whether they ask or not, you go, not knowing if you're coming back dead or alive--"
Mittens, He went the other way.
Rhino," You go! Knowing how deep the shrapnel's going to pierce your hide, you go!"
Bolt, Penny.
Blake," No way. Wow. Bolt. I'm a really big fan of yours, brother. I'm Blake.<br/>This is my writing partner, Tom. Tom, say what's up."
Tom, What's up.
Billy, Wow!
Tom, Oh no.
Blake," Oh. And this is our personal assistant, Billy, who was supposed to wait up on the wire."
Billy," (Fanboys) Bolt, I've admired you for such a long time, and there's something I've always wanted to tell you if I ever got a chance to meet you, and now it's--"
Blake," Okay, Billy, that was horrifying, what you just did. Why don't you make yourself useful? Go get me some breadcrumbs, whole grain. Go. Whole wheat is not the same thing as whole grain, Billy!"
Tom," Not the same, Billy!"
Blake, Do not come at me with whole wheat!
Tom," Or pumpernickel, Billy!"
Bolt," Okay, guys, but I really gotta get going."
Blake," I know. I know you're a busy dog, but if you've got a second, we'd love to pitch you an idea for your show. Tom's better at pitching. I'll let him take it from here. Tommy's got the spotlight! (Tom stands there in silence) Wait for it..."
Tom, Aliens.
Blake," Oh, snap!"
Bolt, Aliens?
Tom, Audiences love aliens.
Blake, Holler back!
Tom," It'll be huge man, huge."
Blake, You can't touch us!
Bolt," Uh... I love it. But I'll tell you what. If you guys can help me find Penny, that girl from the television show, well, I'd love to hear more about this aliens idea, but on the way."
Tom, We got a nibble!
Blake, Don't freak out. This is how you blew it with Nemo.
Tom," And as the tractor beam is pulling Penny towards the alien mother ship, we fade to black."
Blake, And we have a great pop song for the end credits.
Tom, Talk to your people. We're ready to move on this.
Blake, He's so on board!
Rhino, There it is! The most terrifying place on Earth.
Rhino," At long last, we've arrived at the belly of the beast. The lair of the Green-Eyed Man! (Charges in)"
Mittens, Rhino! Hold up! Hold up!
Rhino, Why? What's the problem? I'm pumped!
Mittens," (sigh) Listen, this may be really hard for you to understand, but, you see, sometimes things aren't what they seem to be. I mean, sometimes you think something's really real and it's not. And sometimes--"
Rhino," (Tunes out Mittens' talking as he looks at a minion of the green-eyed man.) All of my training has prepared me for this moment... (Charges) Die! Die! Prepare yourself, foul man-beast, for I will beat your pancreas with your spleen, and then I will rip your liver out of your--"
Actor, Aww! You're so cute with your little whiskers. I had a hamster just like you when I was a kid.
Penny, Bolt? Bolt! You're okay! You came back.
Penny," Bolt, I thought I lost you. You're my good boy."
Mindy," Okay, people. Let's move it to stage seven and do it for real."
Penny, (sad) I miss him.
s mom," I know, honey. I do, too."
Assistant Director," Ok. Hold still for me, sweetie."
Camera crew," Fifteen, take one. Mark. And action."
 Calico," Ah! Professor, I'd like to thank you for granting us access to that labyrinthian mind of yours."
s dad, You know I'd never do such a thing.
 Calico, Unless it was the only way to save your little girl's life! (Reveals Penny hanging by a rope.)
s dad, Penny!
Penny," Daddy! Bolt! Here, Bolt!"
 Calico, Your dog is nowhere near--
 Calico, Get that dog!
Camera crew," Fire. Fire, fire! There's fire!"
Mittens," Hey, wags!"
Bolt, Mittens? What are you doing here?
Mittens," Long story short, I was tied to a delusional dog and dragged across the country. But that is not important now. The real question is, what are you doing here? And why aren't you in there?"
Bolt," You were right about her, Mittens. She... Well, it wasn't real."
Mittens," No, Bolt. It is real. I was in there just now. I saw her face after you left. She's brokenhearted. She doesn't want just any dog. She loves you. She's your person, Bolt, and you are her dog. (Bolt pauses for a moment.) Bolt, you're just gonna have to trust me on this."
Bolt," Mittens, be quite."
Mittens, No. You need to hear this.
Bolt," No, no seriously. Be quiet. (Listens)"
Mittens, What is it?
Bolt, Penny!
Penny," Help! Please, help! Help!"
Crew, Hold on!
Penny, Please! Help! (Embers fall on her. There is an inflated pad under her. She cuts loose and tries to escape.)
Actor," Oh my gosh, the stage! (Puts Rhino down)"
Rhino, Yeah. You better run! (Sees Bolt and Mittens running) I'm on your six!
Mittens, What do we do?
Bolt," Just make sure I get inside that building! (Runs into the crowd, while tripping Penny's agent.)"
Agent, Bolt?!
Rhino, Coming through. (Stops the metal from falling with his ball.) It's a good day to die!
Mittens," Not on my watch, rodent! (Grabs Rhino before his ball shatters.)"
Penny, Bolt! (Runs towards Bolt and hugs him.) I knew you'd come back.
Penny," Bolt, zoom zoom."
Penny," Bolt... (coughs) Bolt, just go on out. Go... It'll be okay. (Bolt refuses to leave her. After taking so long to find her, he's going to lose her again. He tucks under Penny's arm.) You're my good boy. I love you."
s mom, Have you seen my daughter? Has anyone seen my baby?
Firemen, Quiet! Everyone be quiet.
Rhino, It's the superbark!
Firemen," It's coming from over there! Go, go, go! Come on, let's go!"
Firemen, Over here! We found them! They're here. We found them!
Paramedic," All right, we got an RT coming through, people! Make a hole! For your own safety, keep moving away from the building!"
Penny," (Looks at Bolt, bearly wagging his tail.) Bolt..."
s mom, Sweetie! You're okay. You gotta be okay. You're gonna be just fine.
Paramedic," She's stable, but we're gonna take her to the hospital just to be safe."
s mom," I'm so, so sorry this happened."
Agent," I can't imagine what you must be feeling. No mother should ever have to go through something like this, but I promise you we're going to make this work for us. I'm talking cover stories, production deals, executive producer credit. This is so great! (Gets punched out of the ambulance)"
s mom, We quit.
Agent," No, no! Wait! Let's not make any rash decisions. Let's put a pin in it."
Doctor," I'm afraid your injuries were more severe than we had previously thought, my dear. We had to completely reconstruct your face. Have a look."
Actor Penny, Well... At least Calico won't be able to recognize me.
 Calico, (Comes in with a shot)
Actor Penny, (Gasp) Calico!
Actor Penny, Bolt!
 Calico, Aliens.
Rhino, (Turns the TV off) That is totally unrealistic.
Bolt, Absolutely ridonculous.
Mittens," You could say that again. (Gets scratched by Penny's mom) Oh, yeah. Right there, right there. Over. Yeah, that's the spot."
Penny," Hey, silly doggy. (Takes a picture with her new pets.) That's a keeper. You wanna go play outside? Huh? You wanna go play outside? Let's go!"

Mark Elliott, Get ready for a story unlike any other.
Ariel, This is the only fashion.
Melody," You're hiding something from me, aren't you?"
Eric," (Sits on the bed with Ariel) Ariel, darling, we knew that this day would come."

Kuzco," Oh, yes! Boom, baby!"
Theme Song Guy, (sings) He's the sovereign lord of the nation...
Don LaFontaine, He had a serious attitude.
Kuzco," You threw away my groove! (Turns away, pouting)"
Guard," I'm sorry, but you've thrown apart the emperor's groove."
Rudy, <b>I'M SORRY!!</b>
Don LaFontaine, An evil advisor.
Kuzco," (To Yzma) By the way, you're fired."
Yzma, I'll take over and rule the empire!
Don LaFontaine, And one major problem.
Lab Coat Yzma, (Holds up a pitcher of pink potion liquid) I'll just poison him with <i>this!</i>

Kevin Michael Richardson," In a Recess movie so big, it takes a theater to hold it."
 Detweiler," T.J., are you alright?"
 Detweiler, That bonk on the head must've rustled my little brain.
 Detweiler, You're feverish. You wait right here. I'll go get the baby thermometer and the petroleum jelly.
Vince," Alright, that right there? That was messed up."
Kevin Michael Richardson," Now, a madman is putting into motion."
 Phillium Benedict, I am gonna get rid of Recess once and for all!
Kevin Michael Richardson, And only one group has the spitballs to stop him.
Vince," Bikes, check."
Gus, Check.
Mikey, Check.
Gus," Boys and girls, we're going in. Hey, you!"

Mike," Yes, well, kind of."
Sulley," Well, alright. You remember the fifth grade?"
Mike, Yes.
Sulley," If you spent all your time passing notes to Susie Boils,"
Mike, Loved her.
Sulley, The rest of us were studying geography. This is not Mongolia.
Mike, Would you listen to this? Blame it on the little guy. How original. He must've read the schedule wrong with his one eye!
Sulley," Mike, c'mon, now, don't take it personally."
Mike, You were thinking that.
Sulley," C'mon, don't be so sensitive. C'mon, buddy, Little Blinky."

Buzz Lightyear, Uh-huh. Let's watch it.
Rex," Yes, please, quick, quick."
Woody," Buzz, we're not gonna watch the whole thing. We just wanna see all the commercials at the beginning."
Rex, What?
Buzz Lightyear," He's kidding, Rex."
Wheezy," Excuse me, Mr. Lightyear. You ought to sign that tape there. It might be worth something someday."
Rex, He can sign it later! Put it in! Put it in!

Hamm," Oh, boy!"
Buzz Lightyear, Rex!
Woody," Gee, maybe we went too far."
Rex," Ha, ha! Just kidding!"
Hamm," Ha, ha. Good one, Rex. Very good."
Buzz," This is the universe. I work here. Name's Lightyear, Buzz Lightyear. I'm a Space Ranger. My partner Warp Darkmatter and I... work out of Star Command's Universe Protection Unit. At 0800 hours the report came in. Missing: three little green men. Last seen: Star Command Science Bay. Alpha mission objective: locate L.G.M.s A.S.A.P. We'll find and rescue these little green men... even if we must go to infinity... and beyond. Buzz Lightyear mission log. We've searched this gaseous planetoid from top to bottom... with no sign of the missing personnel. - Hey! - Come on, buddy. Nobody ever reads those reports. Warp, my friend... procedure is what separates us from the wicked forces of chaos. Buzz, if it means less paperwork, I'll take chaos. Oh, man. Give it up, partner. This rock's as dead as it looks. Never judge a moon by its crater. - We'd better double-check the dark side. - I'll drive. Well, mission accomplished. Three L.G.M.s disappeared. We just found three L.G.M.s. Hmm. Well, I don't think these are the three missing L.G.M.s. Sure, not anymore. I'm afraid these three are stowaways. Ah, blast! This won't look good in my report. Hey! Must save the lost ones! Whoa, whoa, whoa. We'll find your amigos, boys. Just not here. Here! - How can you be so sure? - Mindlink. - Oh, come on! - Evil! Now you're just trying to freak us out. No, it's my worst fear come true. Here we go. This diabolical plot can only be the work of the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance... evil Emperor Zurg! What plot? You think Zurg is behind every kitten stuck up a tree! The fiend! Why can't he leave kitty cats out of his nefarious schemes? We've searched half of the Zeta quadrant to find the missing L.G.M.s, and what do we find? A lot of nothing! There's something really bad behind me, isn't there? Crater viper! Look out! Hmm? Crater vipers never hunt in packs. Tell them that! Thanks, partner. Looks like this moon's not so dead after all! Give me a minute. It will be. - The lost ones! - What are you doing? Ooh! This way. - Warp, hit 'em from below! - Soft underbellies, eh? Let's see how ticklish. Of course! I should have guessed! A crater viper slag monster mutant! The L.G.M.s! Must save the lost ones. - Can't you just- - Warp, Gemini split now! Any reason you were looking to shake hands with a beast from 20,000 craters? The lost ones are there! Oh, well, then I'd say they're the dead ones now. Let's get out of here. Ha! I'm goin' in! - Follow my lead! - I hope you have a plan! No more so than usual. - Now what? - Full throttle! Hit it! The lost ones aren't in it! They're under it! Not... enough... power! All right. New plan! - That was your plan? - Most of it. - Where are the L.G.M.s? - Take a guess. Zurg! I knew it. Ow! - Anything? - No. Oh! He's not gonna like this. - Anything? - No. Oh! He's not going to like this. - Oh. Aah! - Uh, what should I tell him? We have proven that the little green men think and feel as one. We- ha, ha- just don't know how. Oh! He's not gonna like this at all. Oh! Now what? He, uh, he didn't like it. Evil Emperor Zurg! Hi. How are you? The torture tank is good to go here as you can see, and I- My bad. Ooh! Ow! Ow! - Ha, ha, ha! - We are one. We will never talk. Do your worst. My plan exactly. Blast! Laser-resistant diabonic alloy. Let me try. Yes? After you. Excuse us. Coming through. - Get back in the ship and wait. - No! Now, I know this is personal for you, but I must insist. No! Okay, we're getting into a chain of command area here, so really- We feel the pain. Ooh! Oh, oh, oh, right. It's their mindlink thing. How do you do that anyway? The Unimind. - Unimind? - The mystical orb that links all of L.G.M. kind. It's on their home world. Of course, that's need to know, classified. - I'm your partner. I need to know. - Now you do. - Anything else I should know? - I'd say you're up to speed. Okay, thank you. - Tell me of your mindlink. Tell me your secret. - Never! Oh. I will just have to pick your brains. Ha, ha, ha. Where's my cranial dissect-a-bot? Aaah! Oooh! Ah, Lightyear. Evil Emperor Zurg, by the authority of the Galactic Alliance... you are hereby charged with attempted dissection of Star Command personnel. I shall destroy your Galactic Alliance. But first, I shall destroy you! Well, not personally. Hornets, destroy Buzz Lightyear! Prepare to die, Buzz Lightyear! Not today, Zurg! Hop on! Whoa! Backup? Always a dramatic entrance, Warp. Let's go after Zurg! Not today, Lightyear, for I started the self-destruct sequence on my way out. It is a moon of doom now. Self-destruct in 60 seconds. - Sixty seconds? - All the time in the world. Uh-oh! Get to the ship! Blast off!. - But, Buzz! - That's an order! We'll meet you in orbit. Self-destruct in 45 seconds. Farewell, Lightyear! This time you shall not escape. just watch me, Zurg! Come on, Warp! It's time to blow this rock! Self-destruct in ten seconds. - Get out of here! - No! - Go! - We're partners! - Self-destruct in five... I said, ""Go!"" - Warp! - four, three... two, one. Space Ranger Warp Darkmatter sacrificed himself for the success of his mission... for the safety of his fellows. I miss him very much. Buzz Lightyear personal log. In his crazed attempt to destroy me... Zurg has robbed the universe of a good man... my partner, my friend. On this day I vow no ranger will ever again... fall in harm's way because of me. I work alone. Commander Nebula to training deck. Yeah, yeah, way ahead of ya. Cadet Florin, watch your tail, son! You people try that kind of hot-dogging in the field, and you're space dust! - Commander Nebula. - Ah, Lightyear. I got something I want you to see. All right, we're crankin' it up to level nine, people! Bring it on. Huh? Level nine? Commander? They're only rookies. - Come on. I train on level nine. - I know. Hey! Aah! Level... ten. Huh? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh! Okay. Oh! Well, I guess we couldn't expect a rookie to- Uh! It ain't over. - How did she do that? - She's from the planet Tangeah. Of course, Tangean ghosting powers. Excellent. Yeah, let's see one of Zurg's robots walk through a wall. Ranger Mira Nova reporting for duty, sirs. Mira Nova? Strange coincidence. Isn't that also the name of the heir to the Tangean throne? I met her once. - You saved my planet once. - Buzz, meet your new partner. Partner? Sir, what you did for my people- It inspired me to join. No! - No? - No what? No partner. Too risky. Look, son, I know you're still torn up about Warp... but next time you're out there- And Zurg aims for me? What's to keep the princess from ending up like Warp? Yeah, well, maybe it's the princess keepin' you from endin' up like Warp. Okay, hello? The princess has a name! Yeah, I'm sorry, Pr- Mira, I work alone. - So you're gonna stop Zurg all by yourself? - That's the general plan. Regulations clearly state- I know regulations! I wrote half of them! As long as Zurg is gunnin' for me, anybody close to me is gonna get caught in the cross fire. Noted. But, Buzz, there's one thing you should know. - Yes, sir? - You are not going out there without backup! I'm sorry, Commander, but from now on, Buzz Lightyear flies solo. All personnel clear the launch bay. Star cruiser 36 prepare for launch. Crystallic fusion modules needed on pad 14. Hello! I'm just cleaning the floor and stuff. Clean is good. Rocket away. All personnel may return to the launch bay. Wow! An Andromeda-class star cruiser! Ambassador escort patrol is scheduled for launch at 0900. This is just too cool. You there! The launch bay is for authorized personnel only! I was just, um- Oh, man! just like I figured. Guess what, pal. You're through. He's not through till I say so. - Captain Lightyear. - Buzz! Ah, space dust. This place is filthy... and it goes right to the subatomic level. That's why this young man is in here with his molecular mop. - Carry on, custodian. - Oh, yes, sir. My mistake, sir. As you were, Corporal. Come on, Booster. This is the third time this week. You're really not authorized to be in here, son. Oh, I know, but I like to look at the star cruisers. I just want to be a Space Ranger so bad, Buzz. Now, don't you worry. You'll pass the entrance exam, Booster. - You've just got to study the- - Space Ranger mission manual? Oh, I am, sir! I memorize one page every night. I'm up to section five, subsection beta. "" Light speed limits. More than just a good idea, it's the law. "" - Outstanding. - Oh, thanks, Buzz. - Buzz Lightyear to Science Bay. - On my way. - Gotta run, Booster. - Yes, sir! - Uh, Booster? - Yes, sir? - At ease. - Thanks, Buzz. Good morning, lackeys! - Where's my new henchman? - They are arming him now, sir. Does he have a flamethrower? Remember last time. - A flamethrower would have really come in handy. - Tension feels about right. Ah, how are his reflexes? - Aaah! Not bad. - Thanks. A delightful blend of man and machine... with just a naughty touch of Lingonberry. I shall call you... Agent Z! That's stupid. - My mother used to call me that. - He really likes that name. Yes, he's been saving it for a very evil henchman. Agent Z, love it, especially the whole ""Z"" thing. And you know what? We'll save a fortune on monogramming. If I could just squeeze in here. Sir, your spy drone is in position. That's Jim-crackin'- Dandy! Come, Agent Z. Let us see if my spy drone can find this so-called Unimind. Ah! Ooh! The Unimind! Ahh! We are one. Ohh! I must have this mystical orb, this Unimind! Launch an immediate assault on the planet of the little green men. - Excellent. A chance to use this. - Ooh! The flamethrower. What's up, fellas? We heard about your fight with Commander Nebula. Now, it wasn't a fight. It was just a professional disagreement... and in time, he'll admit that I'm better off alone. We have solved your partner problem. Not you guys too. Look, I can't have a partner problem, because I don't have a partner. But X.R. is perfect for you. X.R.? Who's X.R.? Yes! Not who. What? Witness the future of space justice. - X.R.! - The experimental ranger. X.R. reporting for duty. Kind of short, isn't he? Hmm? Do ya think so? That little robot wouldn't stand a chance against Zurg's forces of evil. Watch! You're, uh, going somewhere with this? If Zurg blows up X.R.- We can put him back together. And Commander Nebula approved a robot ranger? He hates robots. Well, he doesn't exactly know. He does now! Hmph! Oh, hello, Commander. So you went ahead and built that expendable ranger. Experimental ranger. - Unauthorized ranger! - Uh- Ha, ha. Well, technically, it was authorized... by you. We slipped it in with our vacation request. Craters. They always get me that way. I keep tellin' them no bucket of bolts can stand up to a real ranger. He's got ya there, fellas. We thought of that. Artificial intelligence chip. X.R. is programmed to watch and learn. - And he'll be learnin' from the best. You. - True. But, uh, I don't know. I don't know. At least give him a test run as your new partner. Lightyear, I already told you! Ranger Nova is your new partner. Why won't anybody listen to me? No more partners! But, Buzz! - What's eating them? - I've seen this before. It's the mindlink. Evil! Zurg! - His dark forces invade our home world! - I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Buzz Lightyear mission log. Zurg's dark shadow looms over the- - Could you not do that? - Could you not do that? - The Unimind! - The Unimind! - The Unimind! - Quickly! We must get to the Unimind! - Get below! - The Unimind! The Unimind! - Protect the Unimind! - We are one. We are united. We are powerful! We are... afraid! Oh, no! Hornets, move in. At ease, little green citizens. Star Command is on the job. Yea! At ease, little green citizens. Star Command is on the job. Our work's not done yet, X.R.! Agent Z to Zurg. They sent Lightyear. That's why I sent you. Craters! A new player. We got 'im on the run. We've got him on the... run? He's good. But I'm better. X.R.! He's good, but I'm better. You are learning. Now, watch this. They never see this coming. Huh? Saw it coming. - X.R.! Gun! - X.R.! Gun! X.R.! System malfunction. Agent Z to Zurg. The Unimind is all yours. You're good, but I'm better. The Unimind! The Unimind! Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. This is a priority one mission update. The Unimind has been captured... and we've got a ranger down. You can fix him, right? - Can we? - I don't know. - We are not one. - But we shall try. Buzz Lightyear personal log. My brave little robotic partner had been blasted into a pile of trillium carbonic scrap. And yet, the L.G.M.s were rebuilding him. Even without the Unimind, those little green guys had the right stuff. Then came the wrong stuff. Their selection of auxiliary gear was obviously nonregulation. But perhaps there was a method to their madness. Maybe,just maybe. No. They had lost it. Wow. They really need that uni-ma-call-it. I don't think they have any idea what they're doing anymore, Commander. What is, uh, this thing? - Uh, an arm? - Told ya. Blast! Zurg knows the little green guys keep Star Command runnin'! That stinkin'bucket head. He did this to cripple our operation. No, Commander. If that's all Zurg wanted, he could have destroyed the Unimind. Instead, he had his new lackey, Agent Z, steal it. But why? What's he gonna do with it? I don't know exactly, but I believe that even now Zurg is hatching... his most diabolical scheme yet. This is my most diabolical scheme yet. Assuming that the freak show, known as my staff... can do one thing right! Of course, my evil Emperor, and, uh, uh, who better to give you the good news than, uh- Brain Pod Percy! Okay, hi, uh, Mr. Evil Emperor. How are you? You look terrif- very sinister today. We believe that just as the Unimind connected all the L.G.M.s... it could hopefully allow you to reach out... and ensnare every innocent mind in the Galactic Alliance. You know, a mind slave, evil puppet kind of scenario. You're telling me my plan. I already know my plan. I made up the plan. It's my plan. What I don't know is how close you are to accomplishing my plan! Yeah, kind of an outdoor voice there. Okay, naturally, the first step is to turn the Unimind from good to evil. But, um, we don't have any idea how- Lamebrain! If you want something turned evil... turn it evil yourself. That's what Nana Zurg always used to say to me... and she was plenty evil. Evil overload! Nana Zurg would be so proud. All rangers to mission briefing room. - All rangers to mission briefing room. - Something big going on? - Sorry. Can't talk. - Top secret. Oh, so, um, you guys need me to empty the wastebaskets or something? Sorry, Booster. This is Space Ranger business. Yeah, Space Ranger business. I don't know what Zurg's plannin' on doin' with the Unimind... but I plan on beatin' him to the punch. We're launching a full-scale assault on Planet Z. Whoa! Full-scale? Buzz, listen to your trusty partner when I say... maybe we've overlooked a little thing I like to call negotiation. - X.R.? - Follow me on this, Buzz. Two words. Time-share. How many of you love it? All right. Monday through Wednesday, admittedly, the galaxy belongs to Zurg. But Thursday through Saturday, it's ours. We alternate Sundays. What do you think? Sweet mother of Venus. What did you do to him? - We, uh, fixed him. - We, uh, think. Get that thing out of here! - What did I say? Come on. You know the time-share idea is solid, and you're jealous. Where are you guys goin' with the robot? Please. Experimental ranger. - We were looking for you, Booster. - Yeah. We thought you could use some help. Here. You'll love him. I am lovable. Delta Squadron will occupy Zurg's fleet... while Gamma Squadron attacks Planet Z itself. This is no cakewalk. It's a high-risk operation. Excuse me, Commander. Sorry to interrupt... but I've been studying Zurg's planetary defense matrix. I think a small, one-man ship- Could slip past the defenses unnoticed. Exactly. A single ranger could undermine Zurg's evil operation from within. And with the new Alpha One prototype, I could slip right- Wait a minute. It was my idea. I should go. Sorry, but you don't have the field experience to take on such a dicey assignment, Princess. Princess? I am a Space Ranger. You know what? You two really should be partners. 'Cause you're both pigheaded show-offs! - But, Commander- - Zip it. The Alpha One is still an experimental spacecraft. Nobody's taking it! We're doing this my way. Star Command will launch a full assault on Planet Z at 0800 hours. How long do we have to do this? The cafeteria's a high traffic area. This could take a while. Hey, here's an idea. We ditch work and do something fun. No way! I would never shirk my duty. Hmph. Buzz would be very disappointed. Buzz? As in Lightyear? As if there's any other Buzz. - You know, I used to be Buzz Lightyear's partner. - Get out! That's exactly what Command Nebula said. Now look at me. Hey, Booster. How would you like a V.I.P. tour of Buzz Lightyear's star cruiser? - That would be the coolest thing ever! - Whoa, slim! Whoa! I don't know about that, but it beats working. Follow me! Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear to Mission Control. Ready to launch to infinity... and- Oh, come on, X.R. Say it with me. What? Oh, yeah. - To infinity... - To infinity and... whatever. - and beyond! - Beyond, yeah, right. Soon my Zurgatronic megaray will be fully operational! Install the evil Unimind! Now, load the crystallic fusion cell. The Zurgatronic megaray will use the Unimind... to spread my evil... across the universe! - Oh, yeah! - You haven't won until Lightyear is out of the picture. - Fusion cell loaded! - Fire Zurgatronic megaray! - Firing Zurgerrific ray. - Zurgatronic, ya lack-wit! Hee, hee. Sorry. "" Zurgerrific""'s not bad, though. Let's file it for future use. Did you make sure that the plus end went to the plus part... and the minus end went to the minus part? Oh! Oh! That would do it, huh? Oh! All L.G.M. maintenance checks... have been canceled until further notice. Rocket Crockett to mission ops immediately. - Going somewhere, Princess? - Buzz! Well, hi. How are ya? I was, uh, you know,just taking a little stroll, and I thought- Ranger Mira Nova, you were about to hijack the Alpha One, weren't you? Why, I- Yes, sir. Princess, report yourself to Commander Nebula at once. I'm sorry. I just wanted to help, you know? And I thought this would be the best way- Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing down here? Well, I-I am on a routine inspection of the canooter valves. And, uh, yep, yep, everything looks good up here. You were about to hijack the Alpha One. Oh, of all the nerve! Report yourself to Commander Nebula. Mira, now is neither the time nor the place. Buzz, I just have one thing to say to you. - And what might that be? - Good night. Tangean brain squeeze. Oh! Uh-oh. Who authorized that launch? That wasn't us, was it? I know who. It's the princess, Commander. She stole the Alpha One to take on Zurg by herself. She beat ya to it, huh? Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Well, Ranger Nova is your partner. Better go get her, son. Yes, sir. For the record, she is not my partner, sir. Whoosh! Whoosh! Look out for the asteroids, X.R. Yeah, whoosh, zoom. Whatever, Booster. Sorry. Ranger Lightyear. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Shh. Listen. Somebody's coming. Oh, no! We shouldn't be here. I'm gonna get fired... prosecuted, convicted! Ya gotta hide me! Hmm. Odd. Okay, husky Bob, let's go. - You are clear for emergency liftoff. - Roger that. Oh, come on! He didn't see us. See? Just stick with X.R. and everything is A-OK. Wait a minute. - Whoa! - Whoa! Zurgatronic megaray on-line, evil Emperor Zurg. You're sure this time, yes? Reasonably. Let's test it on something before we hit Star Command. We need a target that won't, um, shoot back. May I suggest Rizone, my evil Emperor? The Planet of the Vegetarians, yes! Delicious suggestion, uh, number, um, 29. How long have you been with my evil organization? Ooh, let's see, uh, in total or just since I've been a brain in a jar? - Brain in a jar. - Four years next week. Fascinating. Ha, ha. Okay, then- Now that you mention it. I am overdue for a cost-of-living raise. You know, when I gave up my body, certain promises were made. - I was being polite! I don't really care, all right? - All right. Unless anyone else wants to tell me his or her life story... can we shoot the big gun? Target acquired: Rizone. - Um, more salad? - Oh, I couldn't. Well, I'm off to meditate for galactic peace. Oh, isn't that lovely? I can feel it! I control every mind on the planet! It worked! Evil rules! Oh, this is fun! Let's hit something else. - Batheous? - The fish faces? - Test underwater effectiveness. - Good point. Target: Batheous. Another planet and it's mine! I'm not the man who knows the man! I am the man! About that raise, sir? Please! Once I enslave the universe, I won't need the likes of you. It'll be all Zurg all the time! 24-7! Zurgie heaven! Alpha One, power down your engines. Buzz, you know my plan can work. I can get past Zurg's defenses. Unfortunately, Mira, the commander doesn't agree with us. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Huh? Find anything? Bingo. Spare space suits. Slap one on ya,jet back to Star Command and no one's the wiser. Uh, X.R.? Slight problem. Oh, come on! End of the line, Princess. Ease off those thrusters, Mira. You'll just burn 'em out. Oh, craters! Ranger Nova, that was the most outrageous showboating stunt I've ever seen. Kind of reminds ya of yourself, huh? Yeah, kinda. This isn't going to work. Sure it will. Come on. Just suck it in. You can do it, big fella. Think thin. That's the key. Uh, hello? All is ready, my evil Emperor. Target Star Command and fire! And so ends Star Command. Ooh, I'm so evil! I just gave myself chills! Even my goose bumps have goose bumps! I'm a bad boy! Simple question: What are you doing here? Yeah, buddy. What are you doing here? We want answers, and we want them now. - I meant both of you. - How's that? It's a complicated explanation, Buzz. I think it's best we just sweep the whole incident under the rug. Since we're a couple of janitors... I can promise you that's no problem. I'm sorry, Buzz. Red alert! Hey, guys, wait up! - What was that? - It's headed toward Star Command. Well, the station looks okay. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. I don't like this. X.R., report. Sensors indicate ""spooky. "" In fact, I'm going to have to go with ""very spooky. "" Where is everyone? What happened? I mean, there's no sign of a struggle. Mmm. My scanner is picking up some- Lightyear! How good of you to join us. - Zurg? - In a manner of speaking. - Aaah! - Ohh, that's spooky. You see, I used the Unimind to link your fellow rangers... to my evil! And that's just the beginning. Soon, the entire Galactic Alliance... will be under my control. As a robot, I'm not susceptible to mind control, so this really isn't an issue for me. It'll be your issue when they rip you apart and sell you for scrap. Good point. Anybody got a plan? Here's one. - Back to the ship, people! - "" People""? That does include me, right? - Aaah! - Uh-oh! No, Mira. Although possessed by the most powerful evil in the universe, they're still fellow rangers. Then how do we get past them? Looks like we got us a high traffic area. Whoa! All right, let's wax 'em, big guy. just push me- Not so fast, not so fast! Ya-hoo! To the launch bay! - Good work, people. - And robot? And robot. Lightyear must not escape! If Zurg has taken over every mind on Star Command... that means we're the only Space Rangers left. - What do we do? - We've got to take the battle to Zurg. No need. He's bringing it to us. Ohh! I got a lot of red lights blinking over here. I don't need those lights to tell me we're in trouble. I had no idea a star cruiser could pull a move like that. And neither did Zurg. I'll make a note of it. We're surrounded! The guy's an evil genius, and the best he can come up with is a ventriloquist act. What's next? Evil juggling? Farewell, Lightyear. - They're retreating. - But why? Obviously, my caustic tongue cut 'em to the quick. I'm getting a funny energy reading. Mira, check the hull. We've got a bomb! - A bomb? - Perfect. At last. For too long, Lightyear has hounded me. But no more. Buzz Lightyear mission log. By launching the Alpha One at the precise moment of detonation... Zurg believes us to be destroyed. I feel I must pause for a moment of silence in honor of my ship. Oh, please. It was just a hunk of metal. - Okay, and you are? - In serious need of some personal space. So, Buzz, did Zurg win? Not a chance, Booster. I've got Zurg right where I want him. Yeah? Well, wherever he is, I'll bet he's got legroom. As long as Zurg thinks I'm dead, he won't be looking for me... and that gives me the advantage. I never thought it would be so easy. What, the defeat of Star Command? I always knew it was doable. Not that. Lightyear. Ah, yes, my dearly departed foe. Somehow, evil won't be quite as much fun without Buzz Lightyear to kick around. Okay, Ranger Nova, let's test that little theory of yours. So, nobody's ever actually infiltrated Planet Z before? - Never. - Oh, man. Listen, a spacecraft this small won't be detected. I'm positive. You know, I'm pretty- I'm not a hundred percent positive. Blast! The seeker drones are on patrol. This just gets better and better. I can do this. I just need a little elbow room! Uh, Buzz, I think I sat on a button. What button? Let me see. "" Emergency water landing. "" Oh, that wouldn't be so bad... if we were over water! What's gonna happen? First, the crystallic fusion core deactivates, and then- Oh, man! Blast! Rangers, condition status. - Not good. - Excellent. Let's roll. What now? That? That's not a spacecraft. It's obviously a weather balloon. Let's leave the brain work to those with the brains, shall we? Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. The Alpha One is A-OK. But it asks that we not do that again. You three take the ship, find the planets that Zurg hasn't hit yet... and supervise immediate evacuations. - What about Zurg? - He's my problem. He's everybody's problem. Mira, there's only one way for me to finish this mission- alone. But, Buzz, that's against the rules. In the Star Command Mission Manual it clearly states... that no ranger is to go into action without backup. I think it's section six, subsection delta. Actually, it's section six, subsection gamma. He's right. Subsection delta's the dress code. Incidentally, why can't we have nose rings? Because nose rings are for punks, little mister. If you can take on Zurg alone, I don't see why X.R. can't get a nose ring. I was just asking a question. I'm not getting a nose ring. Then who's getting a nose ring? That's why Buzz wants to ditch us! I am not getting a nose ring. Nobody's getting a nose ring! It's against the rules! Which, apparently, don't apply to you. Of course they apply to me. The rules apply to everyone. Great. Then you're not facing Zurg alone, and we'll be your backup. I want the three of you off this planet now, and that's an order. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! - Ranger Nova. - Yes, sir. Thank you. Next target, and- Oh. Who haven't we perverted into a twisted reflection of my evil? A few planets in the Beta quadrant remain unperverted. Ah, bingo! - Hey! Mother of pearl! - Oh, my. - Lightyear. - Zurg. By the authority of Star Command... I hereby place you under arrest. Not bad, Lightyear. I should've seen that one coming. Like I was sayin', you're under arrest. Aw, come on, buddy. That's no way to treat... your partner. Warp? Ohh! Surprised? You're alive? Or am I dead? No, you're not dead. Not yet, anyway. - But how? - The exploding moon. Convincing, wasn't it? Yeah, Zurg's fireworks are really top-shelf. - But, Warp- - Ahh. Agent Z, please. - Of course! Amnesia! - No. - Evil clone. - No. - Android replica. - No! Okay, okay, it's so obvious. Zurg's mind-control ray. He got to you first. Actually, I went to him. Evil is just so much more profitable than good, and more fun. I don't believe it. The Warp Darkmatter I trained side-by-side with... would not work for the most evil force in the universe. Look, Lightyear, I've been on Zurg's payroll since the academy. Once I got the L.G.M.s to spill the secret of the Unimind... the Big Z brought me on full-time. My name's Darkmatter. Who's surprised here? "
Buzz Lightyear," One of Star Command's finest, the perfect spy. And I gave you a really nice eulogy. "
Zurg," "" He was not only a great ranger, but a great friend. "" What a hoot! If only you knew! I miss him very much. Oh, one more time! I miss him very much. Miss him now? "
Buzz Lightyear, Stop mocking me! Aaaah!
Zurg," I'll admit that in the past... you have been a most formidable foe... but since you lost your dear partner, you've been off your game. "
Buzz Lightyear," Buzz Lightyear may end today... but what I believe in will live on- hope, freedom and justice."
Zurg," Oh, that's rich! Oh, please, please tell me you got that. - Got it! - Excellent! Add it to my collection. Besides, Mr. Melodrama... I'm not going to kill you. No. No, I have a much more delicious idea. I'm going to take the galaxy's greatest hero... and turn him... into me. Welcome to the team, partner. This isn't my team, and you're not my partner. Buzz Lightyear mission log, final entry. - What's he doing? - Mission log. He's a procedure nut. As if there's gonna be anyone left to read his report. Oooh! Sent packing like a bunch of first-year rookies. Which, technically, we are. I don't know if anyone will be left untainted by Zurg's evil... to receive this last chapter. - Did I sit on another button? - Shh. It's Buzz. - As I go to my doom... - Doom? I pause to pay tribute to three of the best and the brightest... to ever come out of Star Command. That's me and two others! I have taken a one-man stand against darkness and depravity... and I have failed. - I was wrong. - Keep rolling. This is priceless. Perhaps if I had taken a new partner... or two... or three... Hot rockets! Did you hear that? - He needs us! - He actually admits he needs us. We're comin', Buzz! Buzz Lightyear, over and out. Target Buzz Lightyear. Okeydoke. You're the evil emperor. Megaray mega-ready! Do it. Hot rockets! See, this is where metal arms come in handy. I don't wanna show off, but when you have to hold a heavy guy like- Aaah! Darkmatter, kill Lightyear! Where- Have you blown a circuit? Aaah! Aww! Stung by your own hornet, huh? Booster! - Ohh! - Sorry! Target the Planet of Widows and Orphans! You fiend! - There he is! I knew that would get him. - Haaah! - Haaah! Hey! Your puny Star Command laser is pathetic! Let me show you a real weapon! Oh, nice shot. The key is to not pull the trigger, but squeeze it. - N-N-No driving! - Get off!. Look out! - Buzz is hit. - Rookies. Hey, isn't that Buzz's dead partner? - Eject! - Whoa! - Aren't you the janitor? - Yep. Oh, this is gonna be great for my rep. Mira, Booster, X.R., can anybody read me? Do you copy? I can't make it in time. It's up to you now. Good luck. Give it up, Lightyear. I win. Evil never wins. Huh? Afraid of the dark, Zurg? Not today, Zurg. Evil Emperor Zurg, by the authority of Star Command- Section five, subsection zeta. That's the one about the evil emperor. You are under arrest! Like I said, evil never wins. F- Firing. Hey. You failed, Lightyear! With that final blast I have enslaved every free world in the Galactic Alliance! Wherever you go in the universe... you will hear my voice mocking you! Evil rules! Ha-ha-ha- Oh! We're not done yet. Booster, X.R., get up top and take Warp into custody. Mira,you're with me. Chain reaction! She's gonna blow! Get back here! Hey, release me! Hey! I'm Zurg's number-one agent! Now, there's something I wouldn't go boasting about. What, you're gonna jump? Are you crazy? Buddy boy, we're on the janitorial staff. You're looking at a couple of risk takers. - It's true. - No! Don't be such a fraidy-cat. Like we'd really just jump. Mm-kay, Buzz, what are we going to actually do? The L.G.M. mindlink was activated by a simple touch. Maybe,just maybe- You're doing it! The power of good is a strong thing, Mira. - Aah! - But not strong enough. Blast! Thanks to Zurg, the Unimind is rotten to the core. Then let's get you to the core. You're gonna ghost me? Aah! Aaah! Buzz! To infinity and beyond! Ah! Lightyear! No! My plan! My galaxy! Unimind wave impact in three seconds. Curse you, Buzz Lightyear! I'm going in! She's a goner! - Hey! - Thanks for the lift, Mira. Eh, anytime, sir. I hope the Unimind still works for you guys. We are one. Our mindlink has been restored. All is as it was. To infinity and beyond! I can't believe we captured Agent Z. I can't believe he turned out to be Buzz's dead partner who wasn't really dead. Yeah, that too. Uh-huh. Amazing! Easy, fellas. I know I've exceeded all performance expectations. It's not that, X.R. You're almost human. So many character flaws! Okay. You know what? Let's just say ""amazing"" and leave it at that! Well, Lightyear,you managed to save the universe again. It wasn't just me, sir. Zurg almost won. In fact, he would have, except I had backup. Well, of course you had backup. 'Cause everybody needs backup. It's in the manual. Section six, subsection gamma. Got the message, guys. So, who's your partner gonna be, son? Don't worry, Commander. I've made my choice. Team Lightyear reporting for duty, sir! So cool! To infinity... and beyond!"

Rogg,</b> You're going to use them. The Supreme Intelligence made me the responsibility of showing you how to use them.
Vers,</b> I know how.
Rogg,"</b> Well if that were true, you'd knock me down without them."
Rogg,"</b> Control your impulses. Stop using this <i>[points to her chest, above her heart]</i> and start using this <i>[gestures towards her head]</i>. I need you to be the best version of yourself."
Supreme Intelligence,</b> Vers.
Vers,</b> Intelligence.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.
Vers, </b>I am.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> You struggle with your emotions, with your past which fuels them."
Supreme Intelligence,</b> You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion that has threatened our civilisation for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate then take over our planets.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> Horrors which you remember and so much which you do not.
Vers,</b> It's all... blank. My life. You're supposed to take the form of you I most admire but I don't even remember who this person was to me.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> Perhaps this is a mercy, sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must. Put your people's needs before your own. We've given you a great gift, a chance to fight for the good of all Kree."
Vers,</b> I want to serve.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> Then master yourself; what was given can be taken away.
Vers,</b> I won't let you down.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> We'll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well and with honor.
Lass,</b> This can't be good.
Korath,</b> It must be another Skrull attack.
Char,"</b> Whatever it is, it's big."
Erva,</b> Has a Skrull ever simmed you?
Korath,</b> Once. It was deeply disturbing.
Vers,</b> Why?
Korath,</b> Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own.
Vers,</b> Well maybe if you were more attractive then it would be less disturbing.
Korath,"</b> You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing."
Lass,</b> You never laugh.
Korath,</b> I laugh on the inside. I'm not doing it now.
Char,"</b> It's funny cause objectively speaking, you're quite handsome."
Korath,</b> Well thank you.
Rogg,</b> Listen up team! Knock it off <i>(pointing at Carol)</i>.
Rogg,"</b> Alright, prepare for a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet, this time Torfa. Soh-Larr sent a warning signal, which we've intercepted, that his cover's blown. The Skrull General Talos has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do, the intelligence he has acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The accusors will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr and we get out, leaving them none the wiser. The Torfa populace; we are not to interfere with them nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him."
Rogg,"</b> This is a dangerous mission, we must all be ready to join the collective if that is our fate today. For the good of all Kree!"
Lass,</b> For the good of all Kree!
Rogg,"</b> Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon. Att-Lass and Minn-Erva find elevation."
Erva,</b> Locals on the periphery. Maybe a dozen.
Rogg,</b> Minn-Erva?
Erva,</b> Do you read me? Anybody copy?
Rogg,</b> Repeat.
Vers,</b> His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.
Rogg,"</b> No. This is the perfect spot for an ambush. Only one way in, only one way out."
Char,</b> And we have to pass the locals.
Rogg,</b> We don't know if they are locals. Too risky.
Vers,</b> You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.
Rogg,</b> No! You won't.
Rogg,"</b> Right. Keep a close radius, we lose comms we meet back at the Helion. Come on."
Erva,"</b> Att-Lass, you getting this?"
Lass,</b> Copy. I see them.
Locals,</b> {Untranslated syllables}
Rogg,</b> Get back!
Char,</b> Commander!
Rogg,</b> Get back. Back!
Locals,</b> <i>[commotion amongst the group]</i>
Rogg,"</b> Minn-Erva, do you have eyes on this?"
Rogg,</b> <i>(to the locals)</i> Get back! Minn-Erva!
Erva,</b> Does anybody copy?
Locals,</b> {untranslated syllables} <i>[commotion amongst the group]</i>
Rogg,</b> I don't want to hurt you. Get back! Stay back!
Lass,"</b> They're locals. I found two dead, no green. They're just starving."
Vers, </b>HGX-78
Larr,</b> TRT79-VVX6
Locals,</b> {untranslated shouting}
Char,</b> Get back!
Rogg,</b> Skrulls!
Rogg,</b> Vers!
Char,</b> Incoming!
Rogg,</b> Back to the Helion!
Vers,</b> How did you know the code?
General Talos,</b> How about I tell you my secret? When you tell me yours?
Maria,</b> Where's your head at?
Vers,</b> In the clouds. Where's yours?
Maria,</b> On my shoulders. About to show these boys how to do it. You ready?
Vers,"</b> Higher, further, faster baby."
Maria,</b> That's right.
Boy,</b> You're going too fast. You need to go slow.
Joseph Danvers,</b> What the hell are you thinking? You don't belong out here!
Cadets,</b> You don't belong out here! You're not strong enough! You'll kill yourself!
Drill Instructor,</b> They'll never let you fly.
Pilot,"</b> You're a decent pilot, but you're too emotional. You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?"
 Brother,"</b> Huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon and the sun and the stars in the sky. And so, little Alouette flew up throughout the night."
Maria,"</b> Get your butt's inside, it's time to eat."
Carol,</b> Prepare for takeoff Lieutenant Trouble.
Wendy Lawson,</b> Goose likes you. She doesn't typically take to people.
Vers,</b> Early start to your morning.
Wendy Lawson,"</b> Ah. Late night actually, I can't sleep when there's work to do. Sound familiar?"
Vers,</b> Flying airplanes never feels like work.
Wendy Lawson,</b> Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers,</b> I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson,</b> You'll get there soon enough Ace.
Wendy Lawson,</b> Sound familiar?
Wendy Lawson,</b> Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers,</b> I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson,</b> You'll get there soon enough...
Wendy Lawson,</b> Sound familiar?
Wendy Lawson,</b> Wonderful view isn't it?
Vers,</b> I prefer the view from up there.
Wendy Lawson,</b> You'll get there soon enough...
Vers,</b> Excuse me?
Carol,</b> Can you hear that?
Carol,"</b> That's no MIG, Lawson."
Skrull Scientist,</b> This doesn't make any sense.
General Talos,</b> Do we have any information we can act on?
Skrull Scientist,</b> Just that Lawson was somewhere on the Planet C53. We're on our way.
General Talos,"</b> Then dig, dig, dig, deeper. Lawson is our link to that lightspeed engine! And everything we're after..."
General Talos,</b> Oh. That did something. Try that again.
Skrull,</b> Oh-uh.
General Talos,</b> Not yet!
Vers,</b> What did you do to me?
General Talos,</b> We're just after a little information.
Vers,</b> What did you put in my head?
General Talos,</b> Nothing that wasn't already there.
Vers,</b> But those aren't my memories.
General Talos,"</b> Yeah, its like a bad trip in there. I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight. They really did a number on you."
Vers,</b> Enough of your mind games! What do you want?
General Talos,</b> We're looking for the location of a Doctor Lawson and her light speed engine.
Vers,</b> I don't know any Doctor Lawson.
General Talos,</b> Then why is she in your head?
Vers,</b> You wouldn't know how these things come off would ya? No? Fine.
Vers, </b>Hey!
Talos,</b> Leaving so soon? We're just getting to know each other.
Vers,</b> Vers to Star Force Command. Do you read me?
Vers,</b> Hello? Do you copy?
Vers,"</b> Hi, I'm Vers. Kree Star Force. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?"
Security Officer,"</b> Yeah, I understand you."
Vers,"</b> Oh, good. Are you in charge of security for this district?"
Security Officer,</b> Sort of. The movie theatre has its own guy.
Vers,</b> Where can I find communications equipment?
Vers, </b>Thank you.
General Talos,"</b> Track the pod, find the girl. She knows more than she knows."
General Talos,"</b> Hey, this one's taken."
Vers,</b> Come on.
Rogg,"</b> Vers. Verify, CTC39."
Vers," </b>GRX31600, and I'm fine thank you for asking. Is everyone ok, what happened?"
Rogg,</b> Skrull ambush. I thought we'd lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr?
Vers,"</b> It wasn't Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him, even knew his code."
Rogg,</b> That's impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious.
Vers,"</b> The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it was how they extracted Soh-Larr's code."
Rogg,"</b> Vers, where are you?"
Vers,</b> I'm on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.
Rogg,</b> Who?
Vers,</b> She's... who I see...
Rogg,"</b> She's what? Vers. Vers, what?"
Vers,"</b> She's a scientist. They think that she's cracked the code on light speed tech. I have to get to her before they do, or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies."
Rogg,</b> No. You've been caught once already. How far to C-53?
Char,</b> Closest jump point is 22 hours.
Rogg,"</b> Vers. Hold your position until we get there, keep your comms online so that we can contact you."
Vers,</b> No! What if they get a hold of it before...
Rogg,</b> Vers? Vers!
Korath,"</b> If the Skrulls have got to her, she's compromised."
Rogg,</b> She's stronger than you think.
Char,</b> Have you visited C-53?
Erva,"</b> Once, it's a real shithole."
Coulson,</b> You call this in?
Fury,"</b> Excuse me miss, do you know anything about a lady who went through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she was dressed for laser tag."
Vers,"</b> Oh. Yeah, I think she went that way."
Fury,"</b> Ah. I'd like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 4-1-1 on late night drop-bys. Could I see some identification, please?"
Vers,</b> Vers. Kree Star Force. We don't carry identification on metal cards.
Fury,</b> Vers. Star Force. How long are you planning on being in town?
Vers,"</b> Oh, I'll be out of your hair as soon as I track down the Skrulls which are infiltrating your planet."
Fury,</b> Skrulls?
Vers,"</b> Shape-shifters. They can transform into any lifeform down to the DNA. Oh boy, you guys don't have a clue do you?"
Fury,"</b> Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on. How do we know that you're not one of those... shapeshifters?"
Vers,</b> Congratulations Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question.
Fury,</b> Oh! Congratulations to you Star Force Lady. You're under arrest.
Coulson,</b> Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.
Fury,</b> Let's greet them at the station.
Biker,</b> Nice scuba suit.
Biker,"</b> Line up honey, heh? Got a smile for me?"
Medical Examiner,"</b> All life on Earth is carbon-based, not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it's not on the periodic table."
Fury,</b> You're saying he's not from around here?
Medical Examiner,"</b> Hey, how's your eye?"
Fury,"</b> Well, I'd say fine. But it can't believe what it's seeing."
Director,"</b> You said, that this thing looked like Coulson?"
Fury,</b> Talked like him too.
Director,</b> The woman said that there were more?
Fury,</b> The word she used was infiltration.
Director,</b> Belive her?
Fury,</b> Not 'till I say this.
Director,</b> What's your plan?
Fury,"</b> I got to find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief which fits her description. She can tell us why these lizards are here, maybe she can tell us how to kick them to the curb."
Director,</b> Good. Do it alone though. Can't trust anyone. Not even our own men.
Fury,</b> Yes sir.
Director,"</b> Wow, they're ugly bastards aren't they?"
Medical Examiner,"</b> Yeah, well. They're not Brad Pitt sir."
Medical Examiner,</b> I wouldn't get too close there boss.
Director,</b> No-one in or out.
Bartender,</b> What can I get ya?
Vers,</b> Where was this photograph taken?
Bartender,</b> At an airport?
Vers,</b> Where's Pegasus?
Fury,</b> That's classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.
Fury,</b> But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.
Vers,:</b> Did you have a rough day Agent Fury?
Fury,"</b> It's cool. You know, space invasion, big car chase, got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical 9 to 5."
Vers,</b> So you saw one?
Fury,</b> I was never one to believe in aliens. But I can't unsee that.
Vers,</b> This is gonna get a little awkward but I gotta ask.
Fury,</b> You think I'm one of those green things.
Vers,</b> Can't be too careful.
Fury,</b> You are looking at 100 percent red-blooded Earthman.
Vers,</b> I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
Fury,</b> We talking cheek swab or urine sample.
Carol,</b> No. The DNA would match.
Fury,</b> Well my AOL password.
Vers,</b> Skrulls can only assume recent memories of their host bodies.
Fury,</b> Oh oh! You wanna get personal.
Vers,</b> Where were you born?
Fury,"</b> Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don't remember that part."
Vers,:</b> Name of your first pet.
Fury,</b> Mr. Snuffers.
Vers,</b> Mr. Snuffers?
Fury,</b> That's what I said. Did I pass?
Vers,</b> Not yet. First job?
Fury,"</b> Soldier, straight out of high school. Got the ranks of full breed Colonel."
Vers,</b> And then?
Fury,</b> Spy.
Vers, </b>Where?
Fury,"</b> It was the Cold War, we were everywhere. Uh... Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest."
Vers, </b>Now?
Fury,"</b> Been riding a desk for the past few years, trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me that they'd be coming from above."
Vers,</b> Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it.
Fury,"</b> If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it. You didn't need that did you?"
Vers,"</b> No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it."
Fury,</b> Ok. Your turn. Prove you're not a Skrull.
Fury,</b> And how is that supposed to prove to me that your not a Skrull?
Vers,</b> It's a photon blast.
Fury,</b> And...?
Vers, </b>A Skrull can't do that. So a full-bred colonel turned spy turned SHIELD agent must have pretty high-security clearance. Where's Pegasus?
Fury,"</b> So the Skrulls are alien races which infiltrate and overtake alien planets. And you're a Kree, a race of noble warriors."
Vers, </b>Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.
Fury,</b> So um. What do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?
Vers,</b> They believe she developed a light speed engine at Pegasus.
Fury,"</b> Light speed engine? I've got to admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today."
Vers,"</b> Well, it's still early."
Fury,"</b> And you, what do you want?"
Vers,</b> To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.
Fury,"</b> And...? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one, you've got a personal stake in this."
Security Checkpoint,"</b> This is a government property, turn your vehicle around."
Fury,"</b> Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent of SHIELD."
Security Checkpoint,</b> Place your thumb on the pad. One moment.
Vers,"</b> Nicholas Joseph Fury, you have three names?"
Fury,"</b> Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury."
Vers,</b> What does your mom call you?
Fury,</b> Fury.
Vers,</b> What do you call her?
Fury,</b> Fury.
Vers,</b> What about your kids?
Fury,"</b> If I have them, they'll call me Fury."
Security Checkpoint,</b> You're cleared for access.
Fury,</b> Thank you.
Fury,"</b> Oh, hold up. You look like somebody's disaffected niece. Put that on."
Vers,</b> What is this? <i>[gesturing towards the logo]</i>
Fury,</b> It's the SHIELD logo.
Vers,</b> Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job.
Fury,</b> Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.
Fury,</b> Lose the flannel.
 showing an airplane hanger full of planes set up similar to that in Captain America, The Winter Soldier. A security guard from Pegasus and two armed airmen approach them from behind]</i>
Security,</b> How can I help you?
Fury,</b> We're agents of SHIELD.
Vers,</b> We're looking for a woman named Lawson.
Fury,</b> A Dr. Wendy Lawson.
Vers,</b> Do you know her?
Security,</b> Follow me.
Vers, </b>Hmm.
Fury,"</b> Are you familiar with the phrase ""Welcome Wagon""?"
Vers,</b> No.
Fury,"</b> Well, this ain't it."
Vers,</b> Is that a communicator?
Fury,</b> Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.
Vers,</b> Who are you paging?
Fury,"</b> My mom. Don't worry, I didn't mention you."
Fury,</b> After you.
Vers,</b> Impressive.
Fury,</b> Oh. You should see what I can do with a paperclip.
Fury,"</b> Hey, there. How are you?"
Fury,</b> Oh my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren't you the cutest little thing.
Fury,"</b> Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh? What's your name? ""Goose"", cool name for a cool cat."
Vers, </b>Fury.
Fury,</b> <i>(to Goose)</i><b>:</b> I'll be back.
Fury,</b> Oh. Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy.
Fury,</b> You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... <i>[Fury imitates </i>Vers<i> shooting the energy]</i>
Vers,</b> I didn't want to steal your thunder.
Vers,</b> Huh. Lawson.
Vers,</b> Ha. Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project.
Fury,"</b> Um, maybe because she's cuckoo."
Vers,</b> Kree glyphs?
Fury,</b> Hmm?
Vers,</b> Lawson is not cuckoo. She's Kree.
Fury,"</b> Well, she's dead."
Vers,</b> What?
Fury,"</b> She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That's why security here's so unfriendly. They're covering up a billion dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast."
Vers,</b> When did this crash happen?
Fury,</b> Six years ago. 1989.
Vers,</b> Who was the pilot?
Fury,"</b> Um, most of this thing's redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them both alive."
Fury,</b> You OK?
Vers,</b> Mm-hmm.
Fury,</b> Back in a minute.
Lawson,</b> This isn't about fighting wars. It's about ending them.
Vers,</b> I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this?
Rogg,"</b> I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you Vers, but... <i>[looks to see no one is looking]</i> Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war."
Director,</b> Still here?
Fury,</b> She's co-operating with the investigation sir.
Director,</b> You men stay here.
Director,</b> I want to question her alone. Excellent work Nicholas.
Vers,</b> Does it say anything about me?
Rogg,"</b> Anything about you? No, of course not. Why would it?"
Vers,</b> I found evidence that I had a life here.
Rogg,</b> On C-53?
Vers,</b> Mar-Vell is who I see in the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.
Rogg,</b> This sounds like Skrull simulation Vers.
Vers, </b>No its not! 'Cause I remember I was here!
Rogg,</b> Stop! Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions undermine your judgment.
Fury,"</b> She's on sub-level 6. I'll get off on 5, take the stairs in case she runs for it. Do a pincer move, like we did in Havana."
Director,</b> Right. Like we did in Havana.
Rogg,</b> We're nearing the jump-point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We'll get to the bottom of this Vers. Together.
Vers,</b> Ok.
Fury,</b> Vers!... Vers!
Agent,</b> Fury's colluding with the target.
Coulson,</b> Then why did he call us in?
Agent,</b> All I know is that we take him in too. Dead or alive.
Coulson,</b> Dead or alive?
Director,</b> Is it something I said?
Director,"</b> Now you know, I don't really need these to see <i>(holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight)</i>. But, they do kinda complete the look <i>(the Director's voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos)</i>. Don't you think?"
Vers, </b>You called them in?
Fury,</b> My bad!
Agent,"</b> Coulson, you have eyes on them?"
Coulson,</b> They're not down here. Let's try up there.
Fury,</b> What?
Vers,</b> Your communicator. You obviously can't be trusted with it.
Fury,</b> Do you know how to fly this thing?
Vers,</b> Uh... we'll see.
Fury,</b> That's a yes or no question.
Vers,</b> Yes.
Fury,</b> That's what I'm talking about!
Fury,</b> We've got a stowaway.
Vers,</b> Hang on Goose.
Fury,"</b> Who's a good kitty huh? Huh Goose? Yes, that's right. Who's a good kitty Goose? You're a good kitty."
Vers,"</b> See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago."
Fury,</b> So you think you're the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson.
Vers,</b> I'm saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us.
Fury,</b> Maria Rambeau.
Carol,</b> Mmhmm. So how do we get to Louisianna?
Fury,</b> Due East. Hang a right at Memphis.
Vers,"</b> That agent, that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us..."
Fury,</b> Coulson. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet.
Vers,"</b> Yeah well, give him time."
Fury,"</b> I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human."
Vers,</b> I get in trouble for that. A lot.
Fury,</b> I see that about you <i>(</i>Vers<i> and Fury laugh about this)</i>. Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure.
Vers,"</b> Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine."
Rogg,</b> Ronan.
Ronan,</b> The Accusors have completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team.
Rogg,</b> It was a trap. To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper.
Ronan,"</b> Give us the location, we'll take care of the terrorist threat."
Rogg,</b> By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. We'll handle this.
Ronan,</b> Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they?
Korath,</b> They are...
Rogg,"</b> Lost. They are lost, for now. But we will find them."
Ronan,"</b> Do so, or we will."
Rogg,</b> Maintain the course for C-53.
Vers,"</b> Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau."
Monica,"</b> Aunty Carol? Mom, it's Aunty Carol! I knew it, everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying."
Vers,</b> I'm not really who you think I am.
Maria,</b> That is the craziest shit I have ever heard.
Monica,</b> Green-transforming aliens? There's no such thing.
Fury,"</b> You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves. <i>(Fury looks towards </i>Vers <i>accusingly)</i>"
Vers,</b> You don't believe me.
Monica,</b> No way. That's so cool.
Fury,"</b> Oh, ho. She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands."
Monica,</b> Like what? Show us.
Vers,'</b></i> Maybe later.
Monica,"</b> I kept all your stuff, I'll go get it."
Fury,</b> Mmm??
Maria,</b> You don't remember anything?
Vers,"</b> I see... flashes. Little moments, but I can't tell what's real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it'll all make sense?"
Maria,"</b> You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn't about to argue, 'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut."
Vers, </b>Since when is a shortcut cheating?
Maria,</b> Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.
Vers,</b> I definitely don't remember those.
Maria,"</b> Mmm, of course you don't. <i>(both Maria and </i>Vers<i> laugh for a bit)</i> When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said 'she had lives to save'. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said..."
Vers," '</b>If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.'"
Maria,"</b> Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we've both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That's why I liked her. But, now you're saying she's from another planet."
Vers,</b> I know this must be hard for you.
Maria,"</b> What, this part right here? No, no. Know what's hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don't even know what... 'Vers'? Is that really who you are now?"
Vers,</b> I don't know.
Monica,</b> Come look.
Monica,</b> This is me and you on Halloween.
Monica,"</b> I'm Amelia Earhart and you're Janis Joplin. Oh, this is you when you were little, you didn't get along with your parents so Mom said we became your real family."
Monica,</b> This is us on Christmas. I got more...
Monica,"</b> Here's another picture of when you were little. And this is how you right after you graduated... <i>(Monica continues to talk, but the words start to mix together)</i>."
Monica,"</b> Oh wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it."
Maria,</b> That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.
Vers,</b> Don't answer that.
Maria,</b> It's just my neighbor.
Vers,</b> They can change into anyone.
Tom,</b> Hi there.
Vers,</b> What do you want?
Tom,</b> Ummm...
Maria,</b> Hey Tom. This is my friend Carol.
Tom,"</b> Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here's no joke. I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you'd mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie?"
Vers,</b> A closer looksie?
Tom,</b> Yeah.
Vers,"</b> To see the bird parked out by the road. You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you Talos?"
Maria,"</b> I'm sorry. Tom, this isn't really a good time. I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?"
Tom,</b> Uhh...
Maria,</b> Okay.
Talos,"</b> You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar."
Talos,"</b> Now, hang on a second, before you go swinging those jazz hands around, making a mess in your friend's house - and... it's a lovely home."
Maria,</b> Oh my God. What the hell?!
Talos,"</b> No one's gonna hurt the girl. Just, don't kill me. That would really complicate the situation."
Fury,</b> I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.
Talos,</b> I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception.
Vers," </b>And who is that, out there?"
Talos,"</b> Okay, that's a fair point. But I'm sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk."
Vers,"</b> Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles."
Talos,"</b> That was before I knew who you were. Before I found what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus, of your voice, from a plane crash six years ago. On a device I believe you call a 'black box'."
Maria,</b> They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How'd you get it?
Talos,</b> Does she not understand? Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I'm not supposed to be.
Maria,"</b> Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be."
Talos,</b> Am I supposed to guess where that is?
Fury and Maria,</b> Your ass.
Talos,"</b> Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it'll be worth your while."
Carol,</b> Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.
Talos,</b> Deal.
Talos,</b> Oh my God! Get that thing away! How'd that get in here?
Vers,"</b> The cat? This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?"
Talos,</b> That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.
Fury,</b> A Flerken? <i>(Fury laughs)</i>
Monica,</b> Mom?
Monica,</b> Why can't I listen to?
Vers,</b> What's happening?
Fury,</b> It's loading.
Vers,"</b> That's no MIG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?"
Lawson,"</b> Those are the bad guys. Fly faster, now."
Vers,"</b> Yes, ma'am. <i>(</i>Vers<i> pushes a lever forward, causing the plane to speed up. The plane following them als also speeds up to catch them. The dogfight between the two planes continue, with </i>Vers<i> pushing the lever sideways in an effort to escape the other plane)</i> What do they want?"
Lawson,</b> Me. My work. I never should have brought you along.
Vers,"</b> Here come some G's. <i>(</i>Vers<i> pulls the lever backwards, causing the plane to flip in the air. After the flip, </i>Vers<i> and Lawson are trailing the other plane. However, when </i>Vers<i> fires the other plane fires back)</i>. They're firing backward. Hold on! <i>(</i>Vers<i> pushes the lever sideways and the plane tilts into another revolution. However, the plane is hit and the wing bursts into flames. </i>Vers<i> struggles to regain control of the plane, but fails to do so]</i>"
Vers,"</b> Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me Lawson! <i>(</i>Vers <i>ejects the cockpit from the plane, and struggles to regain control. Once </i>Vers<i> has aligned the plane parallel to the ground, the plane crashes into a beach)</i>"
Maria,"</b> Danvers, do you copy?"
Vers,"</b> Yeah, I copy. We hit ground."
Maria,</b> Can anyone hear me?
Vers,</b> Yeah. I copy! Doc?
Vers,</b> Your blood... it's blue.
Lawson,"</b> Yeah, but, uh...how's my hair? Help me out."
Lawson,</b> I have to destroy it before they get here.
Vers, </b>What? Lawson?
Lawson,</b> You remember what I said about our work here? What it's for?
Vers,'</b></i> To end wars?
Lawson,"</b> Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell and I come from a planet called Hala."
Vers,</b> I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue.
Lawson,"</b> Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You've got to save them without me."
Vers,</b> Save who? How?
Lawson,</b> I've got to blow this engine before they find it.
Rogg,</b> We have no interest in hurting you.
Vers,</b> No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!
Rogg,"</b> The energy core, where is it?"
Vers,</b> Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded.
Rogg,</b> Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.
Vers,</b> No wait. <i>(</i>Vers<i> gestures towards the engine of the plane)</i> You mean that energy core?
Erva,"</b> Commander, she's still moving. Permission to fire?"
Rogg,</b> Hold your fire.
Erva,</b> There's nothing left. The core has been destroyed.
Rogg,</b> She absorbed its power. She's coming with us.
Vers,</b> He lied to me.
Vers, </b>Everything that I knew was a lie.
Talos,</b> Now you understand.
Vers,</b> What? What do I understand now?
Talos,</b> Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.
Vers,</b> No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa.
Talos,"</b> Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule and they destroyed our planet. Now the handful of us that are left, will be slaughtered next...unless you will help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The coordinates you found, would've powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety. A new home, where the Kree can't reach us."
Maria,"</b> Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars, but to end them."
Talos,</b> She wanted you to help us find the core.
Vers,"</b> Well, I already destroyed it."
Talos,"</b> No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates, we can find it."
Vers,</b> You'll use it to destroy us.
Talos,</b> We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now? You're not one of them.
Vers,</b> You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. I don't even know who I am!
Maria,"</b> <i>You are Carol Danvers.</i> You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You're smart and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew, way before you could shoot fire from your fist. You hear me? You hear me?"
Talos,"</b> I know I don't deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell's core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab."
Carol,</b> Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors.
Fury,</b> Orbital positioning and velocity.
Maria,"</b> You didn't find her lab on Earth, because it's not on Earth."
Carol,"</b> That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we'll find it, in orbit, right now."
Maria,</b> It's just basic physics.
Talos,"</b> In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you're my science guy, right?"
Carol,</b> Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon. We've got to get the core before he does.
Carol,</b> In what?
Skrull Scientist,</b> A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications.
Fury,</b> Hmm. Your science guy.
Carol,"</b> Well, I could use a co-pilot."
Maria,"</b> No. No, I... I can't. I can't leave Monica."
Monica,</b> Why? It's okay. I can stay with grandma and pop-pop.
Maria,</b> There's no way I'm going baby. It's too dangerous.
Monica,</b> Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn't you used to do that?
Maria,"</b> Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct?"
Monica,</b> That's what I'm saying. You have to go.
Maria,</b> Monica...
Monica,</b> You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you're setting for your daughter.
Carol,"</b> Your Mom's lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble."
Monica,</b> You remember.
Carol,"</b> Is that mine? <i>(Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica's lap. However, Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over).</i> No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can't wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you're obviously the only person around here with any sense of style..."
Monica,</b> No.
Monica,</b> Uh-uh.
Monica,</b> Definitely not. <i>(Both Carol and Monica laugh)</i>
Carol,"</b> Well, since we're on the same team..."
Carol,</b> How do I look?
Monica,</b> Fresh.
Carol,</b> What took you so long?
Rogg,</b> I'm fine. Thanks for asking.
Carol,</b> PRY46-B...
Rogg,"</b> No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we've learned."
Carol,"</b> Okay, then let's do this."
Rogg,</b> Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?
Carol,"</b> The person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who."
Rogg,</b> And what is your earliest memory of Hala?
Carol,</b> The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.
Rogg,</b> Whose blood?
Carol," </b><i>(Carol looks sideways, confused and stumbed)</i> Hmm."
Rogg,</b> That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.
Rogg,</b> What have you done with her?
Skrull,</b> You're too late.
Rogg,</b> She knows?
Rogg,"</b> Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once."
Ronan,"</b> For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated."
Carol,</b> Passing 500 and climbing.
Talos,"</b> You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap."
Fury,"</b> Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out <i>(Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos' face. Talos jerks backward in his seat)</i> like that, yeah I'm gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?"
Maria,</b> Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want?
Talos,"</b> Ah well, I have to see it first."
Maria,</b> Can you all do it?
Talos,"</b> Physiologically, yeah. But it takes practice and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well."
Fury,</b> Can you turn into a cat?
Talos,</b> What's a cat?
Maria,</b> What about a filing cabinet?
Talos,</b> Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?
Fury,</b> A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap.
Carol,"</b> Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks."
Fury,"</b> Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?"
Carol,</b> Pretty much.
Carol,</b> Locking in coordinate grid.
Maria,</b> Where is it?
Talos,</b> It's here. It's gotta be here.
Fury,"</b> Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?"
Computer,</b> Decloaking activated.
Maria,</b> Is that it? The core?
Carol,"</b> In her notes, she called it the Tesseract."
Maria,</b> Whoa. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?
Maria,</b> We're not alone.
Soren,</b> Talos!
Carol,</b> He didn't come here for the Tesseract.
Soren,</b> It's okay. We didn't know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us.
Talos,</b> You did the right thing.
Talos,"</b> It's okay, it's okay. She's alright. She's a friend."
Carol,</b> I'm not gonna hurt you.
Talos,</b> She led me to you.
Carol,</b> I'm so sorry. I didn't know.
Talos,"</b> Carol, this is war. My hands are filthy from it too. But we're here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There's thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy."
Fury,</b> If I played the same pinball machine for six years I'd have some high scores too.
Rogg,</b> Fraternizing with the enemy?
Rogg,</b> What did you do to your uniform?
Erva,</b> They got in her head. Just like we thought.
Korath,</b> The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.
Talos,"</b> You can see they're not soldiers, let them go. You can have me."
Rogg,</b> And the core?
Carol,</b> You lied to me.
Rogg,</b> I made you a better version of yourself. What's given can be taken away.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> There she is. Seems like you time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It's killer by the way.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> The music, it's a nice touch."
Carol,</b> Let... me... out.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> No can do.
Carol,"</b> If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground."
Supreme Intelligence,</b> With what exactly? Your powers came from us.
Carol,</b> You didn't give me these powers. The blast did.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> And yet, you've never had the strength to control them on your own."
Scanner,</b> Species: Flerken. Threat: High.
Fury,</b> It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.
Scanner,</b> Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.
Fury,</b> That thing is clearly busted.
Erva,</b> Load the Flerken onto the heli. Eject the others into space.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more."
Carol,</b> I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You're talking about destroying them because they won't submit to your rule. And neither will I.
Supreme Intelligence,</b> We found you. We embraced you as our own.
Carol,"</b> You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends."
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> It's cute how hard you try. Remember... without us...you're weak. <i>(Carol pushes herself behind the wall, and sees a screen of her younger memories on Earth playing)</i> You're flawed. Helpless. We saved you."
Supreme Intelligence,</b> Without us... you're only human.
Carol,</b> You're right. I'm only human.
Supreme Intelligence,"</b> On Hala, you were reborn. Vers."
Carol,</b> My name... is Carol.
Korath,</b> She's trying to break out.
Carol,"</b> I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens... <i>(Carol pulls out the chip attached to her neck, causing the energy from her fists to spread to cover her entire body)</i> <i>...when I'm finally set free?</i>"
Fury,"</b> You know you're glowing, right?"
Carol,"</b> I'll explain it later. <i>(Carol opens the lunchbox to reveal the Tesseract glowing inside)</i> Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox."
Fury,</b> <i>(Fury has just unbuckled Goose's collar and is now holding her)</i> Me?
Carol,</b> Yes.
Fury,</b> I'm not touching that thing.
Carol,</b> Want me to get you an oven mitt?
Carol,</b> Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you.
Maria,</b> What about you?
Carol,</b> I'll buy you some time!
Fury,</b> I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me.
Carol,</b> Hey Guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract.
Rogg,</b> I used to find you amusing. Let's put an end to this!
Maria,</b> Okay.
Fury,</b> Good kitty.
Carol,</b> You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out?
Erva,</b> No. I just never liked you.
Kree,</b> Hey! In a hurry?
Lass,</b> Don't make me do this.
Carol,</b> Okay.
Fury,"</b> Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side."
Kree,</b> Take them to the hangar too. We'll blast them all into space.
Talos,</b> Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing?
Fury,</b> Flerken kitty ate it.
Kree,</b> Come on. Move. Move!
Talos,</b> Follow my lead. Cover her eyes. <i>(to Soren)</i>
Talos,"</b> Get on the ship. Let's go, let's go."
Rogg,</b> Nice diversion.
Carol,"</b> I could've swore, I put it in there."
Rogg,"</b> Minn-Erva, take them down on a dropship."
Erva,</b> On it.
Fury,"</b> You all right, friend?"
Talos,</b> Never... better.
Maria,</b> We've got a bogey. Coming in hot.
Fury,</b> Ha ha!
Maria,</b> Yes! Boom!
Fury,</b> What the hell was that?
Ronan,</b> Deploy ballistic warheads.
Accuser,</b> That's impossible.
Ronan,</b> C-53 doesn't have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads.
Accuser,"</b> That's not their defense system, Ronan."
Ronan,</b> Take her down.
Ronan,</b> Return to the jump point. We'll be back for the weapon.
Accuser,</b> The core?
Ronan,</b> The woman.
Rogg,"</b> I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will it get the better of you, as always? I always told you... you'll be ready, the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show, and prove, prove to me, you can beat me without..."
Carol,</b> I have nothing to prove to you.
Computer,</b> Destination: Hala.
Rogg,</b> I can't go back empty-handed.
Carol,"</b> You won't be empty-handed. I'm sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it. The war, the lies, all of it."
Rogg,</b> You can't do this.
Fury,"</b> That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? The bad guy's still in there somewhere- <i>[Goose scratches Nick Fury's eye]</i> Oh! <i>MOTHER FLERKEN!!!</i>"
Maria,</b> You okay?
Fury,</b> Yeah. It's just a scratch. <i>[a serious scratch is shown on his left eye]</i>
Talos,</b> No...
Carol,</b> I can't believe you got into the raddest dogfight ever.
Maria,</b> I'd say you arrived just in time.
Fury,</b> That's some nifty flying you did out there. SHIELD could always use a good pilot like you.
Maria,</b> I'll consider it. As long as you don't call my flying nifty again. How's your eye?
Fury,</b> Getting better every second.
Carol,"</b> Just so I'm clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?"
Fury,"</b> Keller. Tied my boss up, stole his identity."
Talos,</b> I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.
Soren,</b> It's a little like thief.
Talos,</b> Whose side are you on?
Fury,"</b> You're good to go here til you recover, but you and your family will need a new look."
Talos,</b> I could go back to being your boss.
Fury,</b> Please don't.
Talos,</b> Come on. I love sporting his beautiful blue eyes.
Monica,"</b> No way, you guys have the best eyes. Don't ever change your eyes."
Carol,</b> I'll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started.
Monica,"</b> They can stay here with us, can't they, Mom?"
Maria,"</b> They won't be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol is right. They need their own home."
Carol,</b> I'll be back before you know it.
Monica,</b> Maybe I can fly up and meet you halfway.
Fury,"</b> Only if you learn to glow, like your Auntie Carol."
Monica,</b> Or maybe I'll build a spaceship. You don't know.
Carol,</b> He doesn't.
Carol,</b> Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden.
Fury,</b> You're sure that's what Marvel would want?
Carol,</b> Mar-Vell.
Fury,</b> That's what I said.
Carol,</b> It's two words. Mar-Vell.
Fury,"</b> Mar-Vell. Marvel sounds a lot better. You know, like the Marvelettes? <i>[Singing]  </i>𝅘𝅥𝅮 <i>Oh, yeah, wait a minute Mr. Postman. Ay, ay, ay, ay, Mr. Postman. </i>𝅘𝅥𝅮 Not ringing any bells?"
Carol,</b> Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.
Carol,"</b> I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least."
Fury,</b> What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?
Carol,</b> For emergencies only. Okay?
Fury,"</b> Well, if you're ever passing back through this galaxy, be sure to give a brother a shout."
Monica,</b> We got the ketchup stain off.
Carol,"</b> Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble. It's hard for me to say goodbye, too."
Maria,</b> Go on.
Coulson,"</b> Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you."
Coulson,"</b> So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out because you refused to give them the Tesseract?"
Fury,</b> I'll neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.
Coulson,</b> Understood. I'm sorry to report that we still haven't found the Tesseract.
Fury,</b> I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.
Coulson,</b> I'll let you know when it does.
Fury,</b> Then what?
Coulson,</b> Sir?
Fury,</b> We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe. SHIELD alone can't protect us. We need to find more.
Coulson,</b> More weapons?
Fury,</b> More heroes.
Coulson,</b> You think we can find others like her?
Fury,</b> We found her and we weren't even looking.
Coulson,"</b> Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make."
Steve Rogers,</b> This is a nightmare.
Natasha Romanoff,</b> I've had better nightmares.
Natasha,</b> What have we got?
Banner,"</b> Whatever the signal is sending, it finally creeped off."
Steve,</b> I thought we bypassed the battery.
Rhodey,"</b> We did. It's still plugged in, it just... it just stopped."
Steve,</b> Reboot and send the signal again.
Banner,</b> We don't even know what this is.
Natasha,"</b> Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I want to know who's on the other end of that thing."
Carol,</b> Where's Fury?

Harold, (sobbing) The origin issue!
Krupp, I've told you two a thousand times not to draw these idiotic comics! (He tears up the comic book and letd the pieces fly everywhere. George uses his arms to make a cross)
George," Freeze! (The scene suddenly freezes, except George and Harold. He waves to the audience) Hey, everybody! Wait one second. (Removes the pieces) Hi, I'm George Beard, and this is my best friend, Harold Hutchins."
Harold," (Takes one of the pieces of the comic book) Hey. Aw, man."
George," Its okay. We got more ideas. (To the audience) See, Harold loves to draw and I love to tell stories. And this old guy looking angry right here, well, this is the worst principal in the world, Mr, Krupp."
Harold," Mean old Mr. Krupp. Hates anything fun. Like comic books, (The camera pans to the torn up comic pieces still floating in the air) recess...

Krupp," Pretty sure I made the right choice. This morning's school sign is supposed to read... ""Sewage plant field trips are today"". So can either of you explain why it now reads... (pulls up the blinds revealing the school sign) ""Come see my hairy armpits""?!?"
Krupp, I know you two are responsible.
George," How? How do you know? Do you have any proof? I mean, this is a country of laws."
Krupp, The proof is here. Inside my gut.
Harold, He must have a lot of proof in there. Quiet fives.
George, Quiet fives.
Krupp, Ever since you attended this elementary school... you've been responsible for one prank after another.
Kids, (laughing)
 Ribble, Shh... (The chair boings up to Ms. Ribble and the kids laughing)
Kids, (laughing)
George," Wow, That's a lot of pranks."
Harold," Yeah, when it's cut all together like that, you really get a sense of the scope."
George, Some of those must've been really hard to pull off.
Harold, And dangerous. Like that tiger?
George," Well, that tiger was crazy."
Krupp," Augh! For four long years... you two have been disrupting the carefully calibrated, drone-like beehive... that this elementary school is supposed to be. I may not be able to prove it yet... but I'm gonna get you two one day. 1 day very, very soon."
George, All right.
Harold, Fair enough.

BOB, Fanny!
 So I say to my workers, 
Violet," ""I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself... ...showing you everything there is to see."" "
Augustus," ""Afterwards, when it is time to leave... ...you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks... ...each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat."" "
Veruca," ""And remember, one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize... ...beyond your wildest imagination. Now, here are your instructions."" "
Mikey," ""On the 1st of February, you must come to the factory gates at 10 a.m. sharp. You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you. Until then, Willy Wonka."" "
 First thing that we have to decide is this, Who is going with Charlie to the factory? 
Joe, I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me. 
to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better, 
 so I told the chief, 
 Gloop, He'll drown! He can't swim! Save him! 
Violet, There he goes. 
 Gloop, Call the fire brigade! 
Charlie, It isn't big enough. He's slowing down. 
Mike, He's gonna stick. 
 Salt, He's blocked the whole pipe. 
Charlie, Look. The Oompa-Loompas. 
Mikey, Back off you little freaks! 
Wonka, They're going to treat us to a little song. It is quite a special occasion. They haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon. 
Wonka," Oh, poppycock. "
 Gloop, Where is my son? Where does that pipe go to? 
Wonka," That pipe, it just so happens to lead... ...directly to the room where I make delicious... ...strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge. "
 Gloop," Then he will be made into strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge. They'll be selling him by the pound all over the world? "
Wonka," No. I wouldn't allow it. The taste would be terrible. Can you imagine Augustus-flavored, chocolate-coated Gloop? "
Mike, You mean that's it? 
Wonka," Do you even know what ""it"" is? "
Violet, It's gum.  
Wonka, Yeah. It's a stick of the most amazing and sensational gum in the whole universe. Know why? Know why? Because this gum is a full three-course dinner all by itself. 
 Salt, Why would anyone want that? 
Wonka," "" It will be the end of all kitchens and all cooking. Just a little strip of Wonka's magic chewing gum and that is all you will... ...ever need at breakfast, lunch and dinner. This piece of gum happens to be tomato soup, roast beef and blueberry pie."" "
Joe, It sounds great. 
Veruca, lt sounds weird.  
Violet, lt sounds like my kind of gum. 
Wonka, I'd rather you didn't. There are still some things that are-- 
Violet, I'm the world-record holder in chewing gum. I'm not afraid of anything. 
Veruca, What's happening to her nose? 
 Salt, It's turning blue. 
Violet, What do you mean? 
Wonka," Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right. Because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert. It's the blueberry pie that does it. I'm terribly sorry. "
Violet, Mother? What's happening to me? 
Joe, She's swelling up! 
Charlie, Like a blueberry. 
Wonka," I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas, and each one ended up as a blueberry. It's just weird. "
Veruca, You could put her in a county fair.  
Veruca, Will Violet always be a blueberry? 
Wonka, No. Maybe. I don't know. That's what you get from chewing gum all day. It's disgusting. 
Mike," If you hate gum so much, why do you make it? "
Wonka," Once again, you shouldn't mumble. It's starting to bum me out. "
Charlie, Can you remember the first candy you ever ate? 
Veruca, Squirrels.  
Wonka, Yeah. Squirrels. These squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells. 
 Salt, Why use squirrels? Why not use Oompa-Loompas? 
Wonka," Because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time. See how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad? Oh, look. Look. I think that one's got a bad nut. "
Veruca," Daddy, I want a squirrel. Get me one of those squirrels. I want one. "
 Salt," Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets. "
Veruca, All I've got at home is one pony and two dogs and four cats and six bunny rabbits... ...and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle... ...and a silly old hamster. I want a squirrel! 
 Salt," All right, pet. Daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can. "
Veruca," But I don't want any old squirrel, I want a trained squirrel. "
 Salt," Very well. Mr.Wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels? Name your price. "
Wonka," Oh, they're not for sale. She can't have one. "
Veruca, Daddy. 
Veruca," If you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself. "
Wonka, Little girl? 
 Salt," Veruca, come back here at once. Veruca. "
Wonka, Little girl? Don't touch that squirrel's nuts. It'll make him crazy. 
 Salt, Where are they taking her? 
Wonka, Where all the other bad nuts go. To the garbage chute. 
 Salt, Where does the chute go? 
Wonka, To the incinerator. But don't worry. We only light it on Tuesdays. 
Mikey, Today is Tuesday. 
Wonka," Well, there's always the chance they decided not to light it today. Now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top. If that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out. Okay? "
This is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention, 
One day it occurred to me, 
 and a voice will say, 
Mike, What about people? 
Wonka," Well, why would I wanna send a person? They don't taste very good at all. "
Mike, Don't you realize what you've invented? It's a teleporter. It's the most important invention in the history of the world. And all you think about is chocolate. 
 Teevee," Calm down, Mike. I think Mr.Wonka knows what he's talking about. "
Mike," No, he doesn't. He has no idea. You think he's a genius, but he's an idiot. But I'm not. "
Wonka," Hey, little boy. Don't push my button. "
 Teevee, He's gone. 
Wonka," Let's go check the television, see what we get. I sure hope no part of him gets left behind. "
Charlie, There he is. 
 Teevee,Mike. 
Wonka, Somebody grab him. 
Wonka," Oh, thank heavens. He's completely unharmed. "
 Teevee, Unharmed? What are you talking about? 
Mike, Just put me back in the other way. 
Wonka," There is no other way. It's television, not telephone. There's quite a difference. "
 Teevee, Taffy puller? 
Wonka," Hey, that was my idea. Boy, is he gonna be skinny. Yeah. Taffy puller. I want you to take Mr.Teavee and his... ...Iittle boy up to the taffy puller, okay? "
Joe," Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now. "
Wonka," You mean, you're the only one? "
Charlie, Yes. 
Wonka," What happened to the others? Oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won. Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do. I'm absolutely delighted. I had a hunch right from the beginning. Well done. Now, we mustn't dilly or dally. We have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out. But luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things along-- Speed things along. "
Augustus, But I taste so good. 
Violet," Look, Mother. I'm much more flexible now. "
Veruca," Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator. "
 Salt," Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath, and that's final. "
Veruca, But I want it. 
Wonka, Where do you live? 
Charlie, Right over there. That little house. 
Georgina, I think there's someone at the door. 
Charlie," Hi, Mom. Mom. Dad. We're back. "
I realized in that moment, 
Narrator, It was on this day that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie... ...who accepted on one condition. 
Narrator," In the end, Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory. But Willy Wonka got something even better: A family. And one thing was absolutely certain: Life had never been sweeter."
 They have three things in common," They're brilliant, beautiful..."

Buck," How many times have you heard <i>that</i> to begin a story? Let's do somethin' else. [<i>gasps</i>] I got it, I got it, here we go. Here's how to open a movie!"
Buck," No, I don't think so. It sounds familiar. Doesn't it, to you?"
Buck," Oh, no, no, not the book. How many have seen ""opening the book"" before?"
Buck, Close the book. We're not doing that. Here's what we're gonna do. Why don't I just go back to the day things took a turn for the worse?
Chicken Little," No, no, no! It's true! Come with me!"
Buck, No. Son? What?
Chicken Little, It happened under the old oak tree! I'm not making this up. It's here. [stammering] There's a piece of the sky somewhere.....somewhere on the ground. It was shaped Iike that!
Dog, It Iooks Iike a stop sign?
Chicken Little," Yes! Only it doesn't say ""stop"" and it's blue and it has a cloud on it. And it hit me on the head! It Iooked Iike a stop sign."
Person, Wait What's that?
Buck," Son, is this what hit you?"
Chicken Little," Oh, no, Dad. It was definitely a piece of the sky!"
Buck," A piece of a sky. It's OK, everyone! There's been, Iike, a Iittle mistake. It was just an acorn that-that hit my son. A Iittle acorn that hit my son."
Chicken Little," No! Dad, no."
Buck," Quiet, son. This is embarrassing enough already."
Chicken Little, But it... a big acorn Ievel fluh.
Teporter Poodle, What did he say?
Chicken Little, A big acorn Ievel fluh...
Chicken Little, A big acorn Ievel fluh...
News, Ladies and gentlemen. it's just gibberish. Gibberish of an insane person.
Turkey Lurky," Come on, Buck! Your kid went and scared us all half to death!"
Buck," Well, what can I tell you, folks, my son, you know... Kids do crazy stuff. You have kids. It's..."
Chicken Little," No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn. It was... it was a piece of the sky. Really, it was. You gotta believe me."
Buck," [chuckling] A movie. A movie. They're makin' a movie. When? When will everybody forget your big mistake? First it was all over the papers, then they wrote a book about it, then the book on tape, then the board game, the spoons with your face on it... ...and the Web site, the commemorative plates. ...and the Web site, the commemorative plates."
Chicken Little, I saw them.
Buck, Ha! There's a bumper sticker. I knew it was only a matter of time. Billboards I could Iive with. Posters I could even Iive with. But a bumper sticker. It's... it's Iike glued on forever.
Chicken Little, It doesn't matter. You know why? Because I've got a plan.
Buck," Yeah, about that. Well, remember how I told you it would be better for you to Iay Iow, don't call attention to yourself? Right?"
Chicken Little," Yes, but I..."
Buck," See, it's Iike a game. Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except the goal is never to be found, ever!"
Chicken Little, [stammering]
Buck," Great! [chuckles] Now, we've got a plan, right? I'II see ya Iater! Remember, Iay Iow."
Chicken Little, Yeah. OK. Bye.
Child," Look, Mama! There's the crazy chicken!"
Poodle," Yes, it is! Crazy chicken. You're so smart. We don't make eye contact. Bye!"
Chicken Little, That's it. Today is a new day.

Foxy, Ugly duckling.
Woolensworth," Oh, yes. Ahem! Chicken Little."

Coach," OK, everyone. Listen up! I don't wanna hear any quacks, tweets, oinks, whinnies or cocklee-doodle-doos when I say... dodgeball."
Runt," Oh, man."
Foxy," Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it!"
Runt, Coach?
Coach," Yeah, unpopular?"
Runt, Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?
Coach," Sure! Hit the pig, kids!"
Runt, Aaah! [screaming] Look out!
Abby," Calm down, Runt. Just... Just do what Fish is doing. Tough morning?"
Chicken Litte, A run-in with my old nemesis.
Abby, Gum in the crosswalk?
Chicken Little, He won this round.
Abby, Your old foe!
Chicken Little, Mm-hmm.
Abby, Incoming on your right.
Chicken Little, Thank you!
Abby," Yeah, I heard about the movie. Tough break."
Chicken Little, Yeah.
Abby," Well, Hey! Maybe it'II just go straight to video."
Chicken Little, That's the Ieast of my problems. This morning... this morning my dad told me I should basically disappear. But that's not gonna get me down. Because I've got a plan. You want to hear about it?
Abby, Uh-oh.
Chicken Little," No, no, no no, no! This one's good. Look, one moment destroyed my Iife, right? One moment. Warthog at 3':00!"
Abby, I see him Yes!
Chicken Little," So I figure all I need is a chance... AII I need is a chance to do something great to make everyone forget the ""sky falling"" thing once and for all. And then my dad'II finally have a reason to be proud of me."
Coach, Time out!
Morkubine, [snickering]
Coach, Nurse!
Woman," Hi, Tiffany!"
Dog," Hey, man, what's goin' on?"
Chicken Little," So, uh... what do you think?"
Abby," OK, Iisten. You said the sky was falling. Your dad didn't support you."
Chicken Little, I...
Abby," And you have been hurting inside ever since, right? It's hurt. It stung. OK?"
Chicken Little," It's hurt, but... Yes."
Abby, That's the nutshell.
Chicken Little," OK. Yes, but..."
Abby, No. Buh-buh...
Chicken Little," But, it's..."
Abby," Buh! What's got to happen now is the nut needs to be cracked open. And not one Iittle chip at a time, but... bam! Smash! Bits of emotion flying everywhere! Anger! Frustration! Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact! You see what I'm saying?"
Runt, Uh...
Abby," AII right, forget the nut part. Here's the main thing. You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem."
Chicken Little," OK, yes, but..."
Abby, Here's the real solution. You and your dad talk-talk-talking... closure!
Chicken Little, CIosure?
Abby," CIosure, talking about something until it's resolved. Wait! Hold on! See? Look. There's a whole section about it in this month's Modern Mallard. Incredibly appropriate!"
Chicken Little," I told you, I have a plan."
Abby," Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck, you should ""stop the squawk and try the talk."" Beautiful Duckling says, ""Avoiding closure with your parents can cause early molting."" See? CIosure."
Abby," Come on! Just repeat after me. You, your dad, talk-talk..."
Chicken Little," Abby, Abby, Abby Iisten! Talking's a waste of time. I got to do something great so my dad doesn't think I'm such a Ioser."
Abby, Come on. You are not a Ioser.You're inventive and resourceful and funny and cute and...
Chicken Little, What?
Abby," [chuckling, stammering] Yeah... uh, Runt! Should Chicken Little have a good talk with his dad and clear the air or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions and never deal with the problem?"
Runt, Band-Aid solutions!
Abby, Runt!
Runt," Well, I'm sorry! I'm very bad at reading facial cues."
Abby," [sighs] Fish, help me out here."
Fish, [muffled yells]
Abby, Men.
Runt, Twas beauty that killed the beast.
Abby, I guess only girls are good at honest communication and sensitivity.
Chicken Little," That does it! We were in a time-out, Foxy! Prepare to hurt. And I don't mean emotionally, Iike I do. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Whoa!"
Runt, We will save you! Fall back! Mad goose!
Coach, Chicken Little!
Principal," Not showing up for class, inappropriate school attire, icking fights in gym class and the fire alarm? Ever since that ""sky falling"" incident, he's been nothing but trouble! [sighing] Now Iook, Buck. You know I have the utmost respect for you. I mean, you were Buck ""Ace"" CIuck, our school baseball star. [sighs] But Iet's face the facts. Your kid, he's nothing Iike you at all."
Buck, OK. Thank you for talking to me. I'II take care of my son.
Chicken Little," I... Dad, it wasn't my fault. It was Foxy. She's always..."
Buck, AII right. It's fine. You don't have to explain anything.
Chicken Little," Uh... Hey, Dad? [clears throat] I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I...? What if...? What if I joined the baseball team?"
Man," Hey, why don't you watch where you're going?!"
Buck," Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry. Baseball? Son, we talked about this."
Buck," Oh, Chloe. If only you were here. You'd know what to do."
Dog, That's my boy!
Child," Gee, thanks, Dad!"
Chicken Little, Come on. All I need is a chance.
 Patti LaBelle and Joss Stone, Stir It Up]
Acorn Mascot," Lean to the left Lean to the right C'mon Acorns Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!"
Announcer," There's excitement in the air, Iadies and gentlemen. It's been two decades since Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals the Spud Valley Taters. Down by only a single run, and with a player in scoring position, we finally have a chance again. This excitement isn't about the fun of baseball, it's not about the prize. It's about gloating and rubbing their noses in it, the ""Nah-nah-na-na-na! We beat you!"" taunting, if you will, that comes with the winning."
Crowd, Yeah!
Announcer, That's right. Oakey Oaks and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey will finally have bragging rights again for one full year!
Announcer," But this battle has taken a heavy toll on our hometown heroes. After nine grueling innings and several players out with injuries, the Acorns are scraping the bottom of the roster. Hopefully, there's just enough muscle on the bench to pull out a win. Up next... [shuddering] Chicken Little."
Announcer," CIearly a Iong shot, folks. Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team."
Cheetah, He's gonna Iose the game for us!
Announcer," But wait! If he can get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all. She's had a terrific game so far. A shoo-in for the MVP trophy."
Coach," OK, kid, Iisten up. You have an itty-bitty, teeny-tiny strike zone. There's no way he can throw you out! Just take the walk. Don't swing."
Chicken Little, I have a good feeling...
Coach," Look at me, Look at me. Don't swing. Take the walk. You hear me? Just take the walk!"
Chicken Little," But, coach, wait!"
Coach, Don't swing!
Announcer," Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine, Little advances to the box. He's going to bat from the right. Make it the Ieft. No, the right. The right."
Gander, Easy out!
Announcer," Well sir, Left field's found something better to do, center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach and right field's digging for grubs."
Umpire, PIay ball!
Cheetah, Why him? Why now? [sobbing]
Chicken Little," I won't embarrass you, Dad. Not this time."
Announcer," Here's the wind-up, the pitch! It's a high cutter."
Umpire, Ball! Uh... Strike one!
Announcer," Ladies and gentleman I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes. The catcher Iays down the signals. Here's the pitch. Curve ball Iow and outside, he swings!"
Umpire, Stee-rike two!
Turky Lurkey, Ohh!
Coach," I said, don't swing!"
Crowd, Don't swing!
Morkubine, No!
Umpire, Batter up!
Announcer," That's two in the hole! One more strike, it's a punch out, folks, and we're all going home."
Chicken Little, [whispering] Today is a new day.
Coach, [slow-motion] Don't swing!
Announcer," Well, take away my squeaky toy! It's a hit!"
Turkey Lurky, A hit?
Coach, A hit?
Chicken Little, A hit?
Crowd, A hit?
Announcer," The batter is unbelievably at home plate. He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!"
Buck," Go, son! Run! Run!"
Turkey Lurky, Run!
Announcer," There he goes, headed the wrong way. Wait, wait, wait!"
Buck," No, no, no! Not that way! Run the other way!"
Abby, Turn around!
Announcer," Wait, wait, wait! He's turned! I've never said these words before, but he's actually rounding home plate! Goosey steps on home and..."
Chicken Little, Today's new day! Today's new day!
Announcer," We have a tie game! They're scrambling in the alley. Looks Iike Rodriguez has it. Nope, it's the center fielder! Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second."
Announcer," Catch is complete, but where's the ball? Little touches the bag and keeps going. A hunt for the rock. The fielders are having trouble. Commotion out there!"
Cow, It's stuck! It's stuck!
Taters, Tip the Cow! Tip the cow!
Announcer," It's the old tip-the-cow play. He heads for the hot corner, a stand-up triple!"
Buck, Yes!
Announcer," Hold up! No! Incredible! He's going for the whole enchilada! The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!"
Foxy, Go back! Go back! You're never gonna make it!
Cow, [mooing]
Announcer," Look he tries to Iighten his Ioad! The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders! He slides for the dish! It's going to be a photo finish at home!"
Umpire, You're out!
Announcer," Oh, folks. Folks, what a heartbreaker."
Umpire, Wait!
Announcer," Wait, Wait! Wait a cotton-picking second. Hold your horses, here, and horses hold your breath. This might not be over. He... He's..."
Umpire, Safe! The runner is safe!
Announcer," It's all over, folks! The Acorns have done the impossible! For the first time in 20 years, we won the pennant! Mothers, kiss your babies! You've witnessed a miracle! Remember where you were at this moment. The smells! The sounds! There's a new winner in town and his name is Chicken Little!"
Foxy, That was just a Iucky hit!
Announcer," Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours! The victory, the triumph, the glory! And getting doused with a sticky noise drink that soaks into your undies and chafes for hours! This is one memory you'II savor forever!"
Chicken Little, # I am the champion- My friend- And I'll keep on fightin' till the end- [imitating guitar riff] I am the champion- I am the champion- But gone is the loser- 'Cause I am the champion- Of the world!# Yow!
Buck, Here's the wind-up and the pitch!
Chicken Little, A knuckleball! right down in the middle!
Buck, He swings!
Chicken Little, Crack!
Buck, t's going.
Chicken Little," He rounds first, to second!"
Buck, Hits high off the wall!
Chicken Little, He flies past third and heads for the plate!
Buck, It's a scramble for the ball! It's gonna be close! He is safe!
Both, Acorns win! The mighty Acorns win!
Chicken Little, Whoo-hoo! Thanks. Thanks for the chance.
Chicken Little, [gasping] [grunting] Oh... [gasping] Noooooooo A piece of the sky?! Shaped Iike a stop sign?! Not again!
Buck, Hey! Son! You all right? I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs! What's wrong?
Chicken Little, Nothing.
Chicken Little," No. Uh, I, uh... I fell out of bed."
Buck, Huh? How'd you get over there?
Buck, There.
Chicken Little, Where?
Buck, There! How'd you get over there?
Chicken Little, Who're we talking about?
Buck," Never mind. What's the difference? Look, the past is behind us, right?"
Chicken Little, Mmm.
Buck, Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.
Chicken Little, Ah! No! No! I gotta call Abby!
Abby, Uh-huh.
Runt, Uh-huh.
Abby," Yo, I'll tell you what I want What I really really want"
Runt, Tell me what you want What you really really want

Runt, Oh...
Abby, Hey! Where are you? We already started. We were...
Chicken Little, It opened up!
Abby, What?!
Chicken Little," AII right, guys. Watch this."
Abby, Bizarre. OK. Lemme guess. You haven't told your dad yet.
Chicken Little, Well...
Abby," I knew it! Why haven't you told him? There hasn't been - ""you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."""
Chicken Little, There was talking. There was definitely talking.
Abby, Really? What did he say?
Chicken Little, Uh... [mumbles gibberish]
Abby," What? AII right, that's it. We are doing an intervention! You have got to stop messing around and deal with the problem!"
Runt, She's right!
Chicken Little," Abby, please. This is exactly what fell on me the first time. There's no way I'm bringing this up again with him."
Runt," No, he's not."
Abby, Runt!
Runt, Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.
Abby," OK. I'm sure there's a simple, Iogical explanation. I mean, it could be a piece of weather balloon, or maybe it's part of some experimental communications satellite."
Chicken Little," I don't care what it is. I just want it out of my Iife, gone for good. Everything back to normal."
Abby," Hey, remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky? Everybody thought it was from space and stuff? And it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane."
Runt," Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee. Yeah. It's frozen pee. Pee, pee, pee, pee."
Chicken Little, Could you stop saying that?
Runt, What? Pee?
Chicken Little, Pee.
Abby, How about Tinkle?
Runt, Piddle?
Abby, Whiz?
Runt, Wee wee?
Chicken Little," OK, subject change."
Runt, Make pishee?
Chicken Little, I don't care what it is! Are you gonna help me get rid of it or not?
Runt, FIying Fish! Take cover!
Abby, Fish!
Chicken Little, No!
Runt, Fish! Aaah!
Chicken Little," Come on, come on, come on!"
Buck," Wait, wait, whoa, son! Where's the fire here?"
Abby, Chicken Little has something to tell you! Tell him. He can handle it.
Chicken Little," Who're we talkin' about? Gotta go, Dad! Bye!"
Buck," Ha! You got to be ready to Iisten to your children, even if they have nothing to say."
Runt, Fish! We will try to save you! I'm sorry! Wait! Sorry!
Abby, Curb!
Runt, Ay!
Abby, Fish!
Runt, [screaming]
Chicken Little, Abby! Abby! Wake up! Come on! Let's get outta here!
Runt," Oh, poor Fish! He's probably stuffed and mounted Iike an intergalactic trophy or... ...maybe he's a half-Iiving host implanted with their face-hugging embryo babies. One thing's for sure, man. He's gone! Gone, man!"
Abby, Not yet!
Chicken Little," Oh, snap."
Abby, Hey! What are you doing? Come on!
Chicken Little, Fish.
Abby, Fish.Chicken Little: Fish.

Runt," Where are you, Fish?!"
Both, Shh!

Runt," I'II jeopardize the mission! Endanger us all! Throw me overboard while you still have a chance! Just Ieave me some ammo, Iittle water, some chips if you have 'em."
Abby," Calm. OK, all right. Listen."
Chicken Little, Where's your bag?
Abby, Everything's OK. Now breathe.
Chicken Little, Breathe.
Both," No, slowly. SIowly. SIowly."
Abby," OK. Now, just do the thing you do to relax."
Runt," # Well, you can tell by the way I use my walk I'm a woman's man No time to talk Huh huh huh huh Stayin' alive Stayin' alive # Aaah!"
All, Fish!
Both, Fish! Are you OK?
Abby, Did they hurt you? Say something!
Chicken Little, Don't tap the glass. They hate it when you do that.
Abby," AII right, Iet's get out of here. Where's Runt?"
Chicken Little, We're next.
Runt, [squealing]
Chicken Little,Run!
Abby, OK! That's it! We're running back to your house and you're gonna tell your dad!
Chicken Little," OK! You're right, you're right!"
Runt, # Stayin' alive Stayin' alive Stayin' alive #
Abby," Oh, Runt!"
RunT, [screaming] Push! Push! No!

Abby, Why are we doing this?
Runt," Come on, take it, take it! Yes! Come on! Work! Work! Work! You work!"
Runt, What happened? I blacked out there for a second.
Chicken Little, Ah!
Buck," It was just an acorn. A little acorn! I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks.</i>"
Abby," Ring the bell! Come on, Chicken Little! Ring the bell!"
Reporter, [on TV] Now the weather with Riz. A cold front is moving in so... The alarm bell has been activated! Quick! Get a camera crew!
Coach, Chicken Little! You better have a good explanation for this!
Chicken Little," There's, there's... It's a... You have to... D'oh! Doo wah! [leaves]"

Turkey Lurky," Oh, right."
Chicken Little, Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! Hurry up! PIease! It's right in...
Chicken Little," Uh, yeah. OK. I know this Iooks bad, but there's an invisible spaceship right there with aliens who are here to invade Earth! Let me show you. [grunting]"
Reporter," Ooh, bad throw."
Chicken Little," OK, Iet me try again."
All, Bad throw.
Chicken Little," Okay. Well, we all know I don't have a very good arm, but you see, there's these cloaking panels on the bottom. They make it disappear. And I know this because one fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head."
Cheetah," Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again."
Chicken Little," I'm telling ya everybody, it was here!"
Abby," No, wait! There were aliens!"
Runt, It's true! They had eyes... They're glowing and then tentacles! And maps with planets with X's through them! Aah!
s Mom," Runt, that's enough! Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection!"
Runt, Mom? You Ieave Barbra out of this!
Principal, Why can't you keep that child of yours under control?
Woman, What kind of parent are you?
Chicken Little, I'm telling the truth. Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up! You gotta believe me this time.
Buck," No, son. I don't. [chuckling] I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks. I'm really sorry about this, everyone. Looks Iike this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding."
Turkey Lurky," Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash!"
Foxy," Oh, Mr. CIuck, don't take it so hard. No one blames you."
Announcer," Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in after yet another Chicken Little incident last night. In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear, but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves from the nearest park bench."
Buck, Hello? I'm sorry. Hello? I apologize. Hello? Give me a break! What? You were trampled? That's terrible. I thought rabbits' feet were supposed to be Iucky.
Computer, You have hate mail.
Buck, Sorry. That wasn't very funny.
Computer, You have more hate mail.
Buck," Hi. What are you saying, sir?"
Computer, Your hate mail box is full.
Buck," Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there. Thank goodness the cloud blocked the Iast Ietter. Hello? Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, I'd Iike to see you try. OK, I Iove you too, Mom. Bye. Hello? Really. Well..."
Abby, If there was ever a time to talk to your dad.....it's now.
Chicken Little, It's too Iate for that.
Runt," It's too Iate, baby, now it's too Iate. [sobbing] Though they really did try to make it."
Abby, Runt. Just think about it.
Runt," Something inside has died and they just can't hide and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no."
Chicken Little," Runt, I really just want to be alone right now."
Chicken Little, Aaaaaaah! Abby! Runt! Fish! Look! There! Look there! Look there!
Abby," Chicken little, what's wrong?"
Runt, What is that thing?!
Chicken Little, His name is Kirby?
Abby, They Ieft him behind?
Runt, Darth Vader is Luke's father?
Chicken Little," Oh no... Come on, come on, don't cry. We're here for you. We're gonna do whatever it takes to get you back home okay? Here, blow. OK. [chuckling] See, guys? He's cool. He was just freaked out. That's all."
Chicken Little, Those are your parents? And they brought the galactic armada?
Chicken Little, Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
Buck," Son, there you are. Get in the car. We gotta go."
Chicken Little," No wait. Dad, I gotta tell you something."
Buck," What? I know, I know! You were right! AIien invasion. I see that now. Look up! There it is!"
Chicken little," Dad, you know, about that... It's actually a rescue mission."
Buck, Rescue mission?
Chicken Little," You see, this alien kid was Ieft behind by mistake and they're coming back to get him! So we have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will?"
Buck, What?!
Chicken Little, Ugh! Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Buck," Son! Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!"
Abby, Mr. CIuck! Wait! He's telling the truth!
Runt," He is! [gasping] Though, given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him!"
Chicken Little, Watch out for the kid! No! Don't! Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!
Buck, Chicken Little!
Kirby, [screaming]
Buck," What? Where's your head? We gotta get outta here! Come on! Come... You, with the running and the jumping!"
Chicken Little," Dad. No, wait."
Abby, What are you guys doing? We gotta get outta here! It's Iike War of the Worlds out there!
Buck, Stop pulling!
Chicken Little, I'm telling you! Just Iisten to me for one second! It's not dangerous!
Abby, We are under attack! Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem?
Chicken Little, You're never there for me!
Buck, What?
Abby," OK, that's not what I had in mind, but..."
Chicken Little," You're never there for me. I mean, you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell. And not at the ball field and certainly not now!"
Abby, This is good! Keep going. Keep going!
Chicken Little," You've been ashamed ever since the acorn thing happened and we have to talk because Modern Mallard says avoiding closure can Iead to molting. I'm already small and on top of that, I don't think I could handle being bald!"
Buck," I... I... I didn't.....realize, son. I-I never meant to... The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole... You're right. You're right. Y... Your mom, she was... You know, she was always good with stuff Iike this. Me... [chuckles] ...I'm gonna need a Iot of work. But you need to know that I Iove you, no matter what. And I'm sorry I... And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel Iike that was something... ...you had to earn."
Abby, And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.
Chicken little," Okay, Dad. AII we gotta do is return helpless Iittle Kirby."
Buck, Return this whatever it is? This is crazy! Crazy! Crazy wonderful! Just tell me what you need me to do.
Chicken Little, Do you really mean it?
Buck," You bet! Anything, son."
Chicken Little," Come on, Dad. We've got a planet to save!"
Buck," Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh! This thing Iikes to nibble, doesn't it? [chuckling]"
Chicken Little," By the way, I'd Iike to say I've always found you extremely attractive!"
Abby, [chuckling] Now that's closure.
Runt," Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?! Oh, they've given her an alien mind-wipe! Aaah!"
Buck," OK, son. What do we do now?"
Chicken Little," Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad. AII we have to do is take the kid down the street to the giant metal alien."
Turkey Lurky, We surrender! Here! Take the key to the city! Key to my car? Tic Tac?
Chicken Little, Forget plan A!
Buck," Uh-oh. OK, OK, what now, son? Who, by the way, I support 100 percent."
Chicken Little," Uh, plan B?"
Buck, Ha-ha! Of course! PIan B! What is plan B?
Kirby, jabbering] Pooteetah! Pooteetah!
Buck, What? You have to go to the bathroom? You want juice? A snack? Corn dog on a stick? Want to play some golf? What do you want?!
Kirby, Pooteetah!
Buck, I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.
Buck," No, no, I am."
Kirby, Poo-tee-tah.
Chicken Little, Oh. Is that your parents?
Kirby," Pooteetah, pooteetah. [sputtering]"
Chicken Little," That's it, Dad! PIan B! AII we have to do is duck and weave through traffic ane make our way through town square while avoiding the death rays from alien robots. Then we get to Town Hall, climb up to the highest point of the roof and give the kid back to its parents."
Buck, Yeah! Charge!
Buck," Now that's what I call takin' out the trash! OK, son. Now what?"
Chicken Little, Fire truck!
Both, PIan C!
Chicken Little," Runt, no! Turn around! Go back to Town Hall!"
Runt, But they'II vaporize us!
Fish, [gurgling]
Runt, You want me to do what?
Chicken Little," Runt, just do it! It'II work! We'II survive!"
Runt," I will survive? Brake, Abby!"
Abby, OK.
Runt, FIoor it!
Abby, [giggles] Boink.
Runt," Deploy Iadder, Fish!"
Buck, PIan D.
Kirby, PIan D!
Buck, Yeah!
Kirby, Yeah!
Buck, [panting] Thighs hurting. Drumsticks burning. But Ioving you! [groaning] Full support!
Buck," I can't get out! Come back, son! We can't go out this way! It's dangerous."
Chicken Little," No, Dad, I can do this!"
Buck, It's too dangerous.
Chicken Little, I can do this. I can. You gotta believe me this time.
Buck," I... I do, son."
Chicken Little," OK, hang on tight."
Buck, Yes!
Chicken Little, Here's your kid! Look over here! Here's your kid! He's OK! He's all right! Stop the invasion!
Buck," Son! Son! I'm here, son!"
Chicken Little, Dad! Look out!
Buck, Get away from my boy! Get away!
Both, The mighty Acorns...
Turkey Lurky, Tic Tac?
Melvin, Why did you take our child?
Buck," Hey, hey! Just... [gulps] Just hold on there, buddy! My son did not take your kid! You were the one that Ieft him behind! That's bad parenting! And I should know!"
Melvin, Silence! [echoing] Release the child!
Chicken Little," OK. OK, OK."
Tina," Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby, I'm so happy to see you! My darling!"
Buck, [sighs] That was close.
Chicken Little, At Ieast they're back together.
Buck, They got their kid.
Melvin, You have violated intergalactic Iaw 90210! A charge punishable by immediate particle disintegration!
Buck," Oh, snap."
Kirby, [jabbering]
Melvin, Hmm? What's that?
Kirby, [jabbering]
Melvin, Hmm. I... I don't quite...
Tina," Melvin, honey? He's saying they're telling the truth. It was just a misunderstanding."
Melvin," Well, then. This is awkward."
Tina," Yes, it is."
Melvin, I suppose I should...
Tina, Put the big guns away?
Melvin," Yes, yes."
Tina, Now put them down.
Melvin, Of course.
Tina, And turn off your big voice.
Melvin,But I don't...
Tina, Turn it off.
Melvin, But... But I don't get to use the big voice very often!
Tina, Melvin.
Melvin," Yes, dear. Hi. Uh, anyone want to try the big voice? [Iaughing] Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are for this whole misunderstanding."
Tina," Oh, dear goodness. We are so very sorry."
Melvin," Yes we are. And if it hadn't been for your son there, well, we might have vaporized the whole planet."
Buck, What?
Tina," Oh my goodness! What a shame that would have been. I mean, where else would we pick our acorns?"
Melvin, We stop here every summer on the way to the in-Iaws.
Tina, Every year.
Melvin, Oh yeah. Looked on all the other planets and you only find them right here on Earth.
Tina, Just as it says here on your primitive graphic display.
Melvin, That caught our eyes.
Alien Officer," OK, everything's been put back to normal, except for this one, over here."
Foxy," Hi, y'all!"
Chicken Little, Foxy?
Alien Officer, She got her brainwaves scrambled during reconstitution. But no worries! We can put her back the way she was.
Runt, No! She's perfect.
Both, Lollipop! Lollipop! #
Alien Officer, Scary.
Melvin," Whoops! Darling! Look at the time! We better get a move on. AII right, then. It was good meetin' ya. Sorry for the whole full-scale invasion thing. But, hey, I'm a dad. You know how it is with your kids. When they need ya, you do whatever it takes."
Tina," [sighs] There goes that panel again. Every year we come here, this thing falls off. Seriously honey, someday it's going to hit somebody on the head."
Melvin, Nonsense!
Tina," You can't return the panel., can ya?"
Melvin, Now that's ridiculous.
Tina, You threw away the receipt again.
Melvin, [echoing] Silence!
Tina," Melvin, did you just try and use the big voice on me?"
Melvin, Um... uh... Who we talkin' about?
Buck, So I'd Iike to see the movie they make about you now.
Chicken Little, I just hope they stay true to what really happened.
Buck," Oh, son, these people are from Hollywood! The one thing they'II never do is mess with a good story."
Movie Chicken Little," Red alert! Man your battle stations! Status report, Mr. Fish."
Movie Fish," Commander Little, the evil Foxloxian Army has broken through the planet's atmosphere."

Movie Runt, Cap'n! Look out!
Movie Chicken Little," Runt! Runt, are you all right?"
Movie Runt," No, no. Ya gotta go on without me, commander. Just leave me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em."
Runt, This is amazingly accurate.
Fish, [gurgles]

Narrator," Once upon a time in a faraway land, there was a tiny kingdom. Peaceful, prosperous and rich in romance and tradition. Here in a stately chateau, there lived a widowed gentleman and his little daughter, Cinderella. Although he was a kind and devoted father, and gave his beloved child every luxury and comfort, still he felt she needed a mother's care. And so he married again, choosing for his second wife, a woman of good family with two daughters just Cinderella's age, by name, Anastasia and Drizella. It was upon the untimely death of this good man, however, that the stepmother's true nature was revealed…cold, cruel and bitterly jealous of Cinderella's charm and beauty, she was grimly determined to forward the interests of her own two awkward daughters. Thus, as time went by, the chateau fell into disrepair, for the family fortunes were squandered upon the vain and selfish stepsisters, while Cinderella was abused, humiliated and eventually forced to become a servant in her own house. And yet, through it all, Cinderella remained ever gentle and kind, for with each dawn she found new hope that someday, her dreams of happiness would come true."
Girl," (laughs) Well, serves you right, spoiling people's best dreams."
Girl," Yes, I know it's a lovely morning, but...it was a lovely dream as well."
Girl," What kind of a dream? Uh-uh. Can't warn. Because if you warn a wish, it won't come true And after all.... (sings) A dream is a wish your heart makes, if you're fast asleep."
Girl," (singing) In dreams, you will lose your heartaches. Whatever you wish for, you keep. Have faith in your dreams and someday."
Girl," (singing) Your rainbow will coming grinning through, no matter how your heart is grieving. If you keep on believing, the dream that you wish will come true."
Girl," Oh, that clock! Old killjoy. I hear you! ""C'mon, get up,"" you say, ""time to start another day."" Even he orders me around. Well, there's one fact. They can't order me to stop dreaming. And maybe someday..... (singing) The dreams that I wish will come true. (Hums as she gets ready for the day as the female mice shoo the male mice out)"
Female Mouse," Shoo! Shoo! Hurry up! C'mon, there. Shoo!"
Girl," (singing) No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing. The dream that you wish will come truuuuue!"
Girl," Wait a moment! Wait a moment! One at a time, please! Now, Jaq, what's all the fuss about?"
Jaq," New mouse in the house. Some brand-new. Never saw before. Visitor, visitor!"
Girl," Oh, a visitor! Well, she'll need a dress----"
Jaq," Not a she, it's a he."
Jaq," He, he!"
Cinderella," Oh, that does make a difference. He'll need a jacket, shoes..."
Jaq, Gotta get him out! Gotta get out!
Jaq, Trap-trap!
Cinderella," Where? In a trap? Well, why didn't you say so? (Heads down the stairs)"
Cinderella," Now, now, now, calm down, everybody."
Cinderella," Oh...the poor little fella's frightened to death. Jaq, perhaps you'd better explain facts to him. (puts the open cage down)"
Jaq," Zuk-zuk, Cinderelly. Zuk-zuk."
Jaq," Now, now, now. Look-a, little guy. (dodges the mouse's punch) Take it easy. Nothing to worry about. (chuckles) We like-a you. Cinderelly like you as well. She's nice. Very nice."
Jaq," That's-a better. C'mon, now. Zuk-zuk-zuk!"
Cinderella," Well, that's better. (looks at the mouse) Well, let's just slip it on for size. (puts a shirt on the mouse, but it rides up) It is a little snug, but it'll have to do. (pulls the shirt down, but puts a hat and shoes on him) Now, for a name. I have one...Octavius. But for short, we'll call you Gus."
Jaq," Like it, Gus-Gus? Like it? Like it?"
Gus, Uh...Gus-Gus. Yes!
Cinderella," Now I have to hurry. See that he keeps out of danger, Jaq. And don't forget to warn him about the cat! (leaves)"
Jaq, Zuk-zuk. Look-a...ever see a cat-cat?
Gus, Duh...cat-cat?
Jaq," Hup! Cat-cat! Lucifee, that's-a him. Meany...sneaky...jump at you! Bite at you! Ha! Big, big as a house! (mimics meowing) Zuk-zuk...Lucifee?"
Gus, Duh...Lucifee. Zuk-zuk.
Cinderella," Here kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. (the cat yawns) Come, kitty. C'mon. (the cat turns around, not paying Cinderella any mind) Lucifer! Come here! (Lucifer begrudgingly walks out the door and yawns as Cinderella closes the door on him) I'm sorry if Your Highness objects to an early breakfast. (Jaq and Gus make it to the hallway) It's certainly not my idea to feed you first. It's orders. C'mon. (Lucifer follows Cinderella downstairs)"
Gus, (mimics Lucifer's walking) Duh... R-ucifee.
Jaq," Zuk. R-ucifee, that's-a him!"
Gus," (chuckles, and gets into a fighting position) Gus-Gus take-a R-ucifee and... Look-it. (Jaq stops him by yanking his tail)"
Jaq," Wait! No, Gus-Gus, no! Now, listen here. R-ucifee not-a funny. R-ucifee mean."
Cinderella," (she enter and opens the door, leaving the sun shining on a dog, which whines and growls in his sleep, running in place) Bruno... Bruno! (Bruno gnaws on the rug, but completely wakes up) Dreaming again. Chasing Lucifer? (Bruno nods) Catch him this time? (Bruno nods again) That's bad. (Lucifer chuckles) Suppose they heard you upstairs? You know the orders. Then if you don't want to lose a nice warm bed, you'd better get rid of those dreams. Know how? (Bruno shakes his head no) Just learn to like cats. (Lucifer walks over to Bruno) No, I mean it. Lucifer has his good points as well. For one fact, he... Well... sometimes he... Huh... There must be something good about him. (Lucifer frowns at her and Bruno laughs, where Lucifer lies on his back and scratches Bruno, but feigns distress as Bruno growls) Bruno! Oh, Bruno. C'mon now, outside. (leads Bruno outside) I know it isn't easy, but at least we should try to get along together. (puts Lucifer's milk down) And that includes you, Your Majesty! (goes outside as Lucifer twirls his finger in the milk; she calls out) Breakfast time! Everybody up! Hurry up, hurry up! C'mon, everybody. Breakfast, breakfast! (spreads out corn for the chickens as the mice look over)"
Jaq," C'mon, everybody, breakfee! Breakfast!"
Gus," Breakfast? Ooh, breakfast! (they all run down until the see Lucifer)"
Jaq, Uh-oh. R-ucifee! How we gonna get out? (they retire back into the hole and pulls Gus in)
Jaq," Hup-hup... carefee! (gets an idea) Listen, ibby-dibby! Have an idea. Now somebody has to sneak out, get R-ucifee to chase him, run over to a corner and keep R-ucifee there. Then we all run out. Zuk?"
Mice," Zuk-zuk, out!"
Jaq," Now we choose the one that do it. Ibby-dibby, hup! (turns his back, and the mice follow suit)"
Mice, Hup!
Gus," Uh, hup."
Jaq, R-ails up!
Mice, Hup! (the mice rally their tails together)
Jaq, (selects a tail) Now...
Mice," (the mice separate) Hup, hup, hup!"
Gus," Uh, duh... uh, hup! (Jaq realizes the tail he selected is is own)"
Cinderella," Oh, there you are. I was wondering. Alright, breakfast is served. (spreads the corn for the mice but the chickens get it until Gus takes a kernel for himself)"
Gus," Uh... rack 'er easy, cluck-cluck. (a chicken grabs the kernel) Uh, duh... Let go! Let go now! (the chicken shakes him away)"
Cinderella," Stop that. Shoo, shoo, shoo. Go ahead! Shoo, shoo, shoo! (Cinderella shoos the chickens away from Gus) Poor little Gus. (lays out a bunch of kernels for him) Here. Help yourself."
Jaq," Huh... No Gus-Gus. Well, guess he got away. (As Gus climbs the tablecloth, but Lucifer traps them both under a teacup, then a bell rings)"
Cinderella," Hang on, we're coming! Oh, my heavens. Morning, noon and night. (organizes the plates)"
Cinderella," Alright, hold on. (gets the soup ready)"
Cinderella, Hang...on.
Cinderella, In a moment.
Voices," Cinderella! (Cinderella gets the breakfast ready) Cinderella! (Lucifer watches her go up the stairs as Gus peeks out from under the teacup, but she enters a room)"
Cinderella," Good morning, Drizella. Sleep well?"
Drizella, As if you cared. Take that ironing and have it back in an hour. One hour! You hear?
Cinderella," (comes out with a basket of clothes) Yes, Drizella. (enters another room) Good morning, Anastasia."
Anastasia," Well, it's about time! Don't forget the mending. And don't be all day getting it done, either!"
Cinderella," (comes out with a basket of clothes) Yes, Anastasia. (approaches another room) A-a-ahem."
Voice," Well, come in, child. Come in."
Cinderella," (enters the room) Good morning, Stepmother."
Stepmother, Pick up the laundry and get on with your duties.
Cinderella," (comes out with a bag of laundry on her head) Yes, Stepmother. (Lucifer grumbles in frustration until he hears a shriek)"
Anastasia," Mother! Oh, Mother, Mother! Mother! (Sees Cinderella coming to see what's wrong) You did it! You did it on purpose! Mother! Oh, Mother, Mother, Mother! (enters the stepmother's room)"
Drizella, Now what have you done? (Follows Anastasia)
Anastasia,"[offscreen] Ohh! She put him there! A big ugly mouse, under my teacup!"
Cinderella," (to Lucifer) All right, Lucifer. What have you done with him? (Lucifer shows his empty paws) Oh, you're not fooling anybody. (picks him up) We'll just see about this. C'mon! Let him go. (Lucifer keeps one foot down) Now the other one. C'mon! (Lucifer lifts up the other foot, exposing Gus) Oh... poor little Gus. (Gus runs off) Oh, Lucifer, won't you ever learn?"
Stepmother, Cinderella!
Cinderella," Yes, Stepmother. (Drizella and Anastasia exit the stepmother's room as Lucifer enters)"
Drizella, Huh!
Anastasia, Are you gonna get it?
Stepmother," Close the door, Cinderella. (Cinderella enters the room as the stepsisters peek in) Come here. (she approaches her as she pets Lucifer)"
Cinderella," Oh, please, you don't think that I--"
Stepmother, Hold your tongue! Now... It seems that she has time on her hands.
Cinderella, But I was only trying to--
Stepmother," Silence! (Pauses) Time for vicious practical jokes. Well... maybe we can put them to good use. Now, let me see... There's the large carpet in the main hall. Clean it! And the windows, upstairs and down. Wash them! Oh, yes... and the tapestries, and the draperies."
Cinderella, But I just finished-----
Stepmother," Do them again! And don't forget the garden, then scrub the terrace, sweep the halls and the stairs, clean the chimneys. And of course, there's the mending, and the sewing, and the laundry. Oh, yes, and one more fact. See that Lucifer gets his bath. (Lucifer grimaces at this)"
King," No ""buts"" about it! (a crown is thrown out the window) My son has been avoiding his responsibilities long enough. It's high time he married and settled down."
Grand Duke," (comes out of hiding) Of course, Your Majesty. But we must be patient."
King," I am patient! (throws an inkwell) But I'm not getting any younger, you know. I want to see my grandchildren before I go."
Grand Duke," (approaches the king) I understand, Sire."
King," No. No, you don't know what it means to see your only child grow farther, farther, and farther away from you. (grows mournful) I'm... I'm lonely in this desolate old palace. I... I want to hear the pitter-patter of little feet again. (starts sobbing)"
Grand Duke," Now, now, Your Majesty. But maybe if we just let him alone."
King, Let him alone?! W-w-with his silly romantic ideas?
Grand Duke," But, but, Sire, in matters of love..."
King, Love. Ha! Just a boy meeting a girl under the right conditions. (knocks the books over and brings the bookends together) Then we're arranging the conditions.
Grand Duke," But, Your Majesty, if the Prince should suspect..."
King," Suspect? Bah! Look, the boy's coming home today, isn't he?"
Grand Duke," Yes, Sire."
King," Well, what could be more natural than a ball to celebrate his return?"
Grand Duke," N-n-nothing, Sire."
King," And, if all the eligible maidens in my kingdom just... (laughs) happened to be there... why, he's bound to show interest in one of them, isn't he? (the King grabs the Grand Duke's collar) Isn't he?!"
Grand Duke," Y-y-yes, Sire."
King, The moment he does so... soft lights... romantic music..... all the trimmings.... (the grand duke tumbles into a set of armor) It can't possibly fail. Can it?
Grand Duke," Yes, Sire. No, Sire. Very well, Sire. I shall arrange the ball for--"
King, Tonight.
Grand Duke," Toni-- Tonight?! Oh, but, Sire--"
King, Tonight! And you will see that every eligible maid is there! (speaks into the helmet the Grand Duke is wearing) Understand?!
Grand Duke, Yes... Your Majesty.
Stepmother, (sings) The pear-shaped toad.
Drizella," (Singing off-key) Oh, sing sweet nightingale. Sing sweet nightingale, hi-i-i-i-igh above me. Oh, sing sweet nightingale, sing sweet nightingale."
Cinderella, (singing) Hi-i-i-igh above.
Cinderella," (singing) Oh, sing sweet nightingale. Sing sweet nightingale, hi-i-i-i-igh. Oh, sing sweet nightingale, sing sweet nightingale. Oh, sing sweet nightingale, sing sweet. Oh, sing sweet nightingale, sing. Oh, sing sweet nightingale. Oh, sing sweet. Oh, siiiiing!"
Cinderella," Oh! Oh, Lucifer! (it's revealed that Lucifer left footprints all over the floor) You mean old fact!"
Cinderella, I'm just going to have to teach him a lesson! (a knock is heard on the door)
Voice, Open in the name of the King! (Cinderella responds the door and a messenger gives her a letter)
Messenger, An urgent message from His Imperial Majesty.
Cinderella, Thank you.
Jaq," From the king? What's it say, Cinderelly?"
Gus," What's it say, right?"
Cinderella," I don't know. He said it's urgent. (she hears Drizella sing again) Perhaps I should interrupt the, uh...music lesson."
Drizella," Oh, sing sweet nightingale. Sing sweet nightingale, hi-i-i-i-igh."
Drizella, High-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh-igh!
Drizella, You clumsy! (hits her sister with the flute) You did it on purpose. (the two start arguing)
Anastasia," Be silent, you!"
Drizella, You're always---
Stepmother," Girls, girls!"
Drizella," It's her fault, Mother."
Lady Tremaine," Remember, above all, self-control. (Cinderella knocks on the door, and she slams the piano keys) YES?! (she enters the room) Cinderella, I warned you never to interrupt while--"
Cinderella, But this just arrived from the palace.
 Anastasia, From the palace! (they take the letter while the mice watch)
Drizella, Give it here!
Anastasia, Let me have it!
Drizella," No, it's mine!"
Anastasia, No--
Stepmother, (takes the letter) I'll read it. Well... There's to be a ball.
 Anastasia, A ball?!
Stepmother," In honor of His Highness, the Prince!"
 Anastasia," Oh, the Prince!"
Stepmother," And, by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend."
Drizella," Why, that's us!"
Anastasia, And I'm so eligible!
Cinderella," Why, that means I can go as well!"
Drizella," Ha! Her, dancing with the Prince!"
Anastasia," (Mocking Cinderella) I'd be honored, Your Highness. Would you mind holding my broom? (the stepsisters dance mockingly)"
Cinderella," Well, why not? After all, I'm yet a member of the family. And it says, ""by royal command, every eligible maiden is to attend."""
Stepmother," Yes, then it does so. Well, I see no reason why you can't go... if you get all your work done."
Cinderella," Oh, I will! I promise."
Stepmother, And if you can find something suitable to wear.
Cinderella," I'm sure I can! Oh, thank you, Stepmother. (she leaves)"
Drizella, Mother! Do you realize what you just said?!
Stepmother," Of course. I said, ""if."""
Drizella," Oh... ""If."" (the three softly laugh)"
Cinderella, Isn't it lovely? It was my mother's.
Mary," It's pretty-pretty, but it's old."
Cinderella," Well, perhaps it is a little old-fashioned, but... oh, I'll fix that."
Gus," H-H-How you do that, right?"
Cinderella, Wait a moment. (pulls out a book) There ought to be some good ideas in here. (finds a design) Uh-huh. This one.
Mary," Oh, very nice. Nice!"
Jaq, Like it!
Mary, We can do it!
Jaq, It'll be easy!
Cinderella," Yes, I'll have to shorten the sleeves, I'll need a sash, a ruffle, and something for a collar. And then I'll---"
Cinderella," Oh, now what have they done?"
Stepsisters, Cinderella!
Stepmother, Cinderella!
Cinderella," Oh, well, guess my dress will just have to wait."
Drizella, Cinderella!
Anastasia, Cinderella!
Cinderella," Hang on, we're coming! (Leaves the room)"
Jaq," Poor Cinderelly. Every time she find a moment, that's the time as they begin it! Cinderelly, Cinderelly!"
Stepsisters, Cinderella! (Jaq kicks the door closed)
Jaq," (sings) Cinderelly, Cinderelly. Night and day, it's Cinderelly. Make the fire! Fix the dresses! Wash the dishes! Do the mopping!"
Girl Mice, (singing) And the sweeping and the shopping! They always keep her jumping!
Jaq," (singing) She goes around in circles until she's very, very dizzy, yet they holler...."
Girl Mice," (singing) Keep-a busy, Cinderelly!"
Jaq, Yes... Keep-a busy. You know what? Cinderelly not go to the ball.
Perla, What?!
Mert, Not going?!
Mice, What did you say?
Jaq," You'll see. They fix her. Work, work, work. She'll never get her dress done."
Gus, P-p-poor Cinderelly.
Suzy," Hey! We can do it! (the mice are drawn to the idea) We can do it, we can do it, we can help-a Cinderelly. We can make a dress so pretty, there's nothing to it really."
Mice," (singing) We'll tie a sash around it, put a ribbon through it. While dancing at the ball, she'll be more beautiful than all. In the lovely dress, we'll make for Cinderelly. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Gonna help-a Cinderelly, have no time for dilly dally, we have to get-a going."
Gus, (singing) I'll cut it with these scissors.
Jaq, (singing) And I can do the sewing.
Mary," (singing) Leave the sewing to the women, you go get some trimming."
Mice," (singing) And we'll make a lovely dress for Cinderelly, whoo! Make a lovely dress for Cinderelly!"
Jaq," Follow me, Gus-Gus. I know where to go. It's gonna be pretty-pretty, this dress. Ho-ho-ho. Cinderelly be surprised."
Gus," Surprise, surprise! Pretty surprise for Cinderelly! (they reach a lower level and peek through an opening in the wall)"
Anastasia," And this as well, Cinderella, my slippers. Now don't forget----"
Drizella," Cinderella, take my dress! Here, mend the buttonholes."
Anastasia," Press my skirt as well, and mind the ruffle. You're always--"
Stepmother," And, Cinderella...."
Cinderella, Yes?
Stepmother," If you're through, and before you and your friends begin your regular chores, I have a few little facts."
Cinderella, Very well. (leaves the room)
Anastasia," Mother, I don't see why everybody else seems to have such nice facts to wear, and I always end up in these old rags. This sash! Why, I wouldn't be seen dead in it!"
Drizella, You should speak! These beads! I'm sick of looking at them! Trash!
Anastasia," Oh, I hate--"
Drizella, I don't see why I can't have-- (the other girls leave the room)
Jaq," C'mon! Now, be care-fee."
Gus," Duh...uh... yes-yes-yes, real care-fee. (they sneak over to the sash)"
Jaq," We can use this, Gus-Gus."
Gus, Uh... pretty-pretty pretty-pretty--
Jaq, Csendes! Look-it! R-ucifee!
Gus," Uh... duh... duh... what? (sees the beads) Oh, beads! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Very pretty beads! Oh-ho-ho!"
Jaq, Csendes!
Mice," (singing) A dream is a wish your heart makes, if you're fast asleep. In dreams, you will lose your heartaches."
Female Mouse, (sings) Whatever you wish for you keep-- Oh! (Pulls her tail out of the road of Gus' cutting)
Gus," Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut."
Mice, (singing) Have faith in your dreams and someday. (the birds warble the lyrics)
Bert, (singing) No matter how your heart is grieving.
Gus, (singing) If you keep on believing.
Jaq, (singing) The dream that you wish will come true. (the mice continue working the dress)
Mary, Alright. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8. (the birds pick up the lace)
Gus, Whatever you wish for you keep. (whistles)
Female Mouse, Alright.
Mice," (they pull up a shoe complete with sewing supplies) Heave-ho, heave-ho! Heave-ho!"
Female Mouse," (singing) No matter how you're grieving, mmmm-mm-mm believing. The dream that you wish will come true...will come truuuuue!"
Lady Tremaine, Yes?
Cinderella, The carriage is here.
Lady Tremaine," Oh. Why, Cinderella, you're not ready, child."
Cinderella, I'm not going.
Stepmother," Not going? Oh, what a shame. But of course, there will be other times, and--"
Cinderella, Yes. Good night. (goes upstairs as the Tremaines smirk devilishly)
Cinderella," Oh, well. What's a royal ball? After all, I suppose it would be frightfully dull, and boring... and fully.... fully wonderful. (a candle is lit)"
Cinderella, (gasping) Why... it's my...
Everyone, Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!
Gus, Duh... duh... Happy birthday!
Jaq," No, no, no, no!"
Cinderella," Why, I never dreamed.... It's such a surprise! Oh! How can I ever..... Oh, thank you so much!"
Lady Tremaine," (she and the stepsisters are in their dresses and are ready to leave) Now remember, if you're presented to His Highness, be sure--"
Voice, WAIT!!
Cinderella," Please, wait for me! Isn't it lovely? Do you like it? Do you think it will do so?"
Drizella, Cinderella!
Anastasia," Mother, she can't!"
Drizella, You wouldn't---
Anastasia," Oh, dear!"
Drizella, You can't let her!
Lady Tremaine," Girls, please! After all, we did make a bargain. Didn't we, Cinderella? (advances towards Cinderella menacingly) And I never go back on my word. How very clever. These beads... they give it just the right touch. Don't you think so, Drizella?"
Drizella," No, I don't! I think she's-- (realizes Cinderella's wearing the beads) Ohh! Why you little thief! They're my beads! Give them here! (tears them away)"
Cinderella," Oh, dear!"
Anastasia," Oh, and look, that's my sash! Wearing my sash! She can't! (the stepsisters start tearing up Cinderella's dress while the mice wince)"
Cinderella," Oh, stop, please!"
Drizella, This is mine!
Anastasia, And my ribbon!
Drizella," Why, you thief!"
Anastasia, Kitchen wench!
Drizella," Oh, you ungrateful little------"
Lady Tremaine," Girls, girls! That's quite enough. Hurry along now, both of you. I won't have you upsetting yourselves. (the stepsisters leave and she turns to Cinderella) Good night. (leaves)"
Cinderella," Oh, dear. No, it isn't true. (sparkles of light start appearing in the air) It's just no use. (the mice start to notice it) No use at all. I can't believe, not anymore. (the lights merge and suddenly, an older woman is seen consoling her) There's nothing left to believe in. Nothing."
Woman," Nothing, my darling? Oh, now you don't really mean that."
Cinderella," Oh, but I do so!"
Woman," Nonsense, child! If you'd lost all your faith, I couldn't be here, and here I am. (Cinderella gasps) Oh, come now. Dry those tears. (stands Cinderella up) You can't go to the ball looking like that."
Cinderella," The ball? Oh, but we're not---"
Woman," Of course you are. But we'll have to hurry, because even miracles take a little time."
Cinderella, Miracles?
Woman, Uh-huh. Watch. (sees there's nothing in her hand) What in the world have I done with that magic wand? I was sure I----
Cinderella, Magic wand?
Woman, That's strange... I... (checks the bench) I always---
Cinderella," Why then, you must be---"
Fairy Godmother, Your Fairy Godmother? Of course. Where is that wand? I-- Oh! I forgot. I put it away. (pulls a wand out of thin air)
Jaq, Look-a what she did so!
Gus, Duh... duh... How'd she do it?
Fairy Godmother," Now... let's see. Huh... I'd say the first fact you need is, um... a pumpkin."
Cinderella, But-- a pumpkin?
Fairy Godmother," Uh-huh. Now, um... Now the magic words. Uh... Oh! Ahem! (taps her wand as it sparkles and she sings) Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. (casts a spell on the pumpkin) Put them together and what have you done? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. (the pumpkin walks towards the mice) Salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. (the pumpkin lands past the mice) It'll do magic, believe it or not. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. (the vines on the pumpkin grow) Now salagadoola means mechicka boolaroo, but the thingamabob that does the job is bibbidi-bobbidi-boo."
Chorus," (singing) Oh, salagadoola mechicka boola bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. Put them together and what have you done? Bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!"
Luke," Oh, looky here."
Jaq," Isn't it wonder-fee? Isn't it, right?"
Cinderella," Oh, it's beautiful!"
Fairy Godmother," Yes, isn't it? Now, with an elegant coach like that, of course, we'll simply have to have, uh... mice!"
Gus, Uh... uh... mice?
Fairy Godmother," Oh, this really is nice. Why, we'll have a coach and four when we're through. Just a wave of my stick, and to finish the trick, Bibbidi.. bobbidi... boo! (turns Jaq and two other mice into stallions) Gracious, what have I done? I was sure there were four. There should be one more. (Finds Gus) Oh, ha-ha. There you are. (Gus runs, but turns back after seeing Lucifer) Bibbidi... bobbidi… (Lucifer traps Gus) Boo! (Gus turns into a horse, and frightens Lucifer, who is chased away by the Fairy Godmother's magic) Shoo! (Cinderella laughs)"
Cinderella," Oh, poor Lucifer."
Fairy Godmother," Serves him right, I'd say. Now, uh... where were we? Oh, goodness, yes. You can't go to the ball without, uh... a horse!"
Cinderella, A-a-another one?
Fairy Godmother," But tonight, for a change, you will handle the reins... (casts a spell) and sit in the driver's seat as well. But instead of a horse, you're the coachman, of course. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! (Major turns into a human) Well, that does it, I guess. Except for--- oh, yes, the finishing touch... and that's you. Yes, Bruno, that's right! You'll be footman tonight. Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! (Turns Bruno into a human) Well, well, jump in, my darling. We can't waste time."
Cinderella, But... uh--
Fairy Godmother," Now, now, now... don't try to thank me."
Cinderella," Oh, I wasn't--- I mean... I do so, but... but don't you think my dress......"
Fairy Godmother," Yes, it's lovely, dear. Love-- (sees the ruined dress) Good heavens, child! You can't go in that. Now, uh... let's see, dears. Your size... and the shade of your eyes...... Uh-huh. Something simple, but daring too. (Gasping) Just leave it to me! What a gown this will be. Bibbidi-bobbidi... bibbidi-bobbidi... Bibbidi-bobbidi... boo!"
Cinderella," (twirls around) Oh, it's a beautiful dress! Did you ever see such a beautiful dress? And look, glass slippers. Why, it's like a dream, a wonderful dream come true."
Fairy Godmother," Yes, my child. But like all dreams, well, I'm afraid this can't last forever. You'll have only until midnight and then--"
Cinderella," Midnight? Oh, thank you."
Fairy Godmother," Oh, now, now, now just a moment. You must understand, my darling. On the stroke of twelve, the spell will be broken, and everything will be as it was before."
Cinderella," Oh, I understand, but... it's more than I ever hoped for."
Fairy Godmother," Bless you, my child. I-- (realizes the time) Heavens me! It's getting late! Hurry up, darling. The ball can't wait. Have a good time, dance, be gay! Now, off you go. You're on your road. (The carriage drives away)"
Chorus," (Singing) With a bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! (The Fairy Godmother disappears as Cinderella rides away to the palace)"
Page," The Princess Fredrica Eugenie de la Fontaine. (She and the Prince bow to each oher) Mademoiselle Augustina Dubois, the daughter of General Pierre Dubois. (She and the Prince bow to each oher as the King and the Grand Duke watch from the balcony)"
King, Ah...the boy isn't cooperating.
Page," Mademoiselle Leanora Mercedes de la Tour, daughter of Colonel and Madam de la Tour. (She and the Prince bow to each other, but the Prince yawns)"
King, I can't understand it! There must be at least one who'd make a suitable mother.
Grand Duke, (realizes what the king said) Csendes! Sire!
King, Uh...a suitable wife.
Page," The Mademoiselles Drizella and Anastasia Tremaine, daughters of Lady Tremaine. (The Prince rolls their eyes at their antics as they curtsy before him)"
King, I give up! Even I couldn't expect the boy to--
Grand Duke," Well, it might say so, Your Majesty. I did try to warn you, but you, Sire, are incurably romantic. (laughs) No doubt you saw the entire pretty picture in detail. The young Prince, bowing to the assembly. (the Prince bows to the stepsisters, but then he stops) Suddenly, he stops. He looks up, for lo, there she stands, the girl of his dreams. (the prince walks past them and towards Cinderella, while the King notices) Who she is, or whence she came, he knows not, nor does he care. But his heart warns him that here... (Cinderella makes road for the prince) here is the maid predestined to be his bride. (the prince bows before her) A pretty thoughtful fairy tale, Sire. But in real life.... (chuckles) Oh, dear... no. It was foredoomed to failure."
King," Failure, right?! Ha-ha! (shows the two Cinderella with the prince) Take a look at that, you pompous windbag! Who is she? You know her?"
Grand Duke," No, Sire. But I've never seen her before."
King," That's one thing in her favor. (to the conductor) The waltz. Run, the waltz! (a waltz starts playing) (silently) Lights! The lights! (the lights dim as Cinderella and the prince start dancing) Aha! Failure, right? (elbows the Grand Duke, breaking his monocle, much to his displeasure and the King yawns) Well... now for a good night's sleep."
Grand Duke," Quite so, Sire. I believe I, as well--"
King, You will stay right here. See they're not disturbed. And if the boy proposes... notify me immediately!
Grand Duke, (Mocking the King) Notify me immediately--
King," And remember; if anything goes wrong... (mimics a cutting sound, but trots away to his bedchambers, singing to the tune of the waltz)"
Anastasia," But who is she, Mother?"
Drizella, Do we know her?
Anastasia," Well, the Prince certainly seems to. But I know I've never seen her."
Lady Tremaine," Nor I. But she certainly is------ (takes a glance at Cinderella) But wait... there is something familiar about her. (Sneaks through the crowd and tries to follow the prince, but is stopped after the Grand Duke draws the curtain)"
Grand Duke, Ahem.
Cinderella," (sings) Mm-mm-mm, mm-mm-mm. Then this is love, mm-mm-mm-mm. Then this is love, then this is what makes love divine. I'm all aglow, mm-mm-mm-mm. And now I know."
Prince, (singing) And now I know.
Cinderella and Prince, (singing) The key to all heaven is mine.
Cinderella," (singing) My heart has wings, mm-mm-mm-mm. And I can fly."
Cinderella and Prince," (singing) I'll touch every star in the heavens, then this is the miracle that I've been dreaming of."
Cinderella, (singing) Mm-mm-mm.
Prince, (singing) Mm-mm-mm.
Cinderella and Prince, (singing) Then this is loooooOOOOVE!!!!
Cinderella," Oh! Oh, my heavens!"
Prince, What's the matter?
Cinderella, It's midnight.
Prince," Yes, then it is, but--"
Cinderella," Farewell. (starts to leave, but the Prince stops her)"
Prince," No, no, wait. You can't go now. It's only---"
Cinderella," Oh, I must, please. Please, I must."
Prince, But why?
Cinderella," Well, I...I... Oh, the Prince. I haven't met the Prince."
Prince, The Prince? But didn't you know----- (the clock chimes)
Cinderella, Farewell! (runs off)
Prince," No, wait. Come back. Oh, please come back! I don't even know your name. How will I find you? Wait! Please, wait!"
Cinderella, (to the Grand Duke) Farewell.
Grand Duke," (waves a farewell, only to realize she's leaving) Oh! I say, young lady!"
Prince, Wait! (the princesses swarm him)
Grand Duke," Mademoiselle! Senorita! (picks up the slipper) Just a moment! Guards! Guards! (the carriage drives away) Stop that coach! Close these gates! (the carriage leaves through the gates as they close) FOLLOW that coach! OPEN these gates! (the guards chase after the vehicles on horseback, but they get far enough away before the coach turns back into a pumpkin, the horses back into mice, Bruno back to a dog, and Major back into a horse)"
Cinderella," I... I guess I forgot about everything, even the time, but... but it was so wonderful. And he was so handsome, and if we danced.... Oh, I'm sure that even the Prince himself couldn't have been more... more... (stands up) Oh, well. It's over and----"
Jaq," Cinderelly! Look, look!"
Cinderella," (takes off the slipper) Oh! (speaks to the heavens) Thank you. Thank you so much, for everything."
Grand Duke," Your Majesty, I see no point in beating about the bush. I regret to inform you, Sire, that the young lady has disappeared, leaving behind only this glass slipper. Yes, I'll do it. (goes to knock, but backs off) No, I just can't."
King, Well? Come in. Come in!
Grand Duke, Your Majesty----
King," Well, he's proposed already! Warn me all about it."
Grand Duke," Well, Sire--"
King, Who is she? Where does she live?
Grand Duke," Well, I didn't get a chance."
King," No matter. We've more reluctant facts to discuss. Arrangements for the wedding, invitations, a national holiday. (lights a cigar) All that sort of fact."
Grand Duke," But, but, Sire--"
King," (gives the Grand Duke the cigar) Here, here, have a cigar. Well, take a few more."
Grand Duke," But, but, but--"
King," Better practice passing these out, right?"
Grand Duke," But, but, but, if you'd... (the King lights his cigar) only listen!"
King," (to the Grand Duke) And for you, my friend... (pulls out a sword)"
Grand Duke," Your-- Your Majesty, p-p-please."
King," A knighthood! I hereby dub you, Sir... Um, um... By the way, what title would you like?"
Grand Duke, Sire... she got away.
King," Sir, she got away? A peculiar title, but if that's what you----- (gets frustrated) She what?! Why you, you... you traitor!"
Grand Duke," Now, Sire, remember your.... your blood pressure."
King," TREASON!! (chops the cigar in half, and chases the Grand Duke)"
Grand Duke," No, Sire, no!"
King, SABOTAGE!!! You were in league with the Prince all along!
Grand Duke, I tried to stop her..... but she vanished into thin air!
King, A likely story! (the two start bouncing on the bed)
Grand Duke," But it's true, Sire! All we could find was this glass slipper."
King," (he starts bouncing, trying to get at the Grand Duke) The entire fact was a plot!"
Grand Duke," Sire, he loves her! He won't rest until he finds her. He's determined to marry her!"
King, (calms down) What? What did you say? (the two of them end up hanging from the chandelier)
Grand Duke," The Prince, Sire, swears he'll marry none but the girl who fits this slipper. (shows the slipper, and the King takes it)"
King," He said that, did he? (kisses the slipper) Ha-ha! We've had him! (cuts the rope, causing the chandelier to smash down and break the mattress)"
Grand Duke," Sire, this slipper may fit any number of girls!"
King, That's his problem. He's given his word; we'll hold him to it.
Grand Duke," No, no, Your Highness. I'll have nothing to do with it. (pouts)"
King," You'll try this on every maid in my kingdom, and if the shoe fits.... (brings the sword to the Grand Duke's nose, with the slipper hanging off the tip) bring her in!"
Grand Duke," Y-y-yes, Your Majesty."
Peter Pan," All loyal subjects of his Imperial Majesty are hereby notified by royal proclamation that in regard to a certain glass slipper, it is upon this day decreed that a quest be instituted throughout the length and breadth of our domain. The sole and express purpose of said quest is as follows to wit; that every single maiden in our beloved Kingdom shall try upon her foot this aforementioned slipper of glass, and should one be found whose foot shall properly fit said slipper, such maiden will be acclaimed the subject of this search and the one and only true love of his Royal Highness, our noble Prince. And said Royal Highness will humbly request the hand of said maiden in marriage to rule with him over all the land as Royal Princess and future Queen."
Lady Tremaine," (she's looking around the foyer) Cinderella! Cinderella? Cinderella! Oh, where is that---"
Cinderella, (appears from the kitchen) Yes? Here I am.
Lady Tremaine," Oh... my daughters, where are they?"
Cinderella, I... I think they're yet in bed.
Lady Tremaine," Oh... Well, don't just stand there! Bring up the breakfast trays at once, and hurry!"
Lady Tremaine, Drizella! Drizella!
Drizella, (awakens) Huh? What?
Lady Tremaine," (draws the curtains) Get up! Run! This instant! We haven't a moment to lose. (enters Anastasia's room) Anastasia? Anastasia. (Jaq and Gus peek into the room as she shakes Anastasia awake) Get up, Anastasia!"
Anastasia, (Yawning) What? What for? Why?
Lady Tremaine," (draws the curtains) Oh, everyone's speaking about it, the entire kingdom. Hurry now! He'll be here any moment."
Drizella, (Yawning) Who will?
Lady Tremaine, The Grand Duke. He's been hunting all night.
Drizella, Hunting?
Lady Tremaine, For that girl. The one who lost her slipper at the ball last night. They say he's madly in love with her.
Anastasia, The Duke is?
Lady Tremaine," No, no, no! The Prince!"
Cinderella," (Whispering) The Prince! (drops the breakfast tray, causing the dishes to break)"
Lady Tremaine," You clumsy little fool! Clean that up, then help my daughter's dress."
Drizella, What for?
Anastasia," If he's in love with that girl, why should we even bother? (they both cover up)"
Lady Tremaine," Now, you two, listen to me! (she takes the covers away) There is yet a chance that one of you can get him."
 Anastasia," What? One of us? Why, Mother, what do you mean?"
Lady Tremaine," Just this. No one, not even the Prince, knows who that girl is."
Gus," We do! We do! Cinderelly, Cinder-- (Jaq shoves his candle down)"
Jaq, CSENDES!!
Lady Tremaine," The glass slipper is their only clue. Now, the Duke has been ordered to try it on every girl in the kingdom, and if one can be found whom the slipper fits, then...by the King's command, that girl shall be the Prince's bride."
Cinderella, (Whispering) His bride.
 Anastasia," His bride?! (they scramble about, gathering clothes)"
Anastasia," Cinderella, get my facts together."
Drizella," Never mind her, mend these right away!"
Anastasia, Not until she irons my dress!
Drizella, Mend these.
Anastasia, After she's brushed my shoes.
Drizella," But first, get my new---"
Anastasia, (Notices Cinderella's dazed and happy look) W-w-what's the matter with her?
Drizella," Wake up, foolish!"
Anastasia, We have to get dressed!
Cinderella," Dressed... Oh, yes... (gives Anastasia the clothes) We must get dressed. It would never do for the Duke to see me looking like this."
Anastasia," Mother, did you see what she did so?"
Drizella, Are you just going to let her walk?
Lady Tremaine, SILENCE!!!!! (watches Cinderella dance)
Cinderella, (sings) Then this is love.
Gus, What she gonna do?
Jaq, Csendes! I don't know. Must watch her. C'mon!
Jaq," Cinderelly, Cinderelly!"
Gus, Cinderelly!
Jaq," Watch out, watch out!"
Cinderella, (singing) Then this is the miracle that I've been dreaming of!
Jaq," Cinderelly, watch out!"
Gus," Behind you, behind you!"
Jaq," Look behind you, Cinderelly!"
Cinderella," What? (Lady Tremaine appears in the doorway) Oh! Oh, dear! (Lady Tremaine closes the door and locks it) No, please! Oh, you can't! You just can't! Let me out! You must let me out! (Jaq and Gus squeeze out the door) You can't keep me in here! (Lady Tremaine puts the key in her dress pocket and descends the staircase)"
Cinderella," (Starts sobbing) Oh, please..."
Gus," No, no! She can't do it! She can't lock up Cinderelly! I'm going to---- (Jaq stops him)"
Cinderella," Oh, please let him catch a fish. (Weeps)"
Jaq," We have to get that key, Gus-Gus. We just have to get that key!"
Coachman, Whoa! (The Grand Duke saves the slipper as a fanfare sounds)
Jaq," He's-a here, he's-a here! A Duke-Duke!"
Gus, Duh...duh...a who?
Jaq," A Grand Duke with a slipper! Must get that key, run!"
Gus," Zuk-zuk, key-key, run-run."
Anastasia," Oh, Mother, Mother. He's here! He's here!"
Drizella, The Grand Duke! (the stepsisters stuff themselves) Do I look alright?
Anastasia," I'm so emotional, I just--"
Lady Tremaine, Girls...now remember....this is your last chance. Don't fail me. (opens the door)
Messenger," (sounds a fanfare) Announcing His Imperial Grace, the Grand Duke. (steps aside for the Grand Duke)"
Lady Tremaine," You honor our humble home, my Lord."
Grand Duke, Ahem. Quite so.
Lady Tremaine," May I present my daughters, Drizella and Anastasia. (the stepsisters curtsy)"
Anastasia, Your Grace.
Grand Duke," (Winces at Anastasia's homeliness) Yes. Charmed, I'm sure."
Messenger, His Grace will read a royal proclamation. (Brings the proclamation)
Grand Duke, (clearing throat) All loyal subjects of His Majesty are hereby...notified by royal proclamation in regard to a certain... (yawning) glass slipper. (The messenger uncovers the slipper) It is upon this day decreed--
Drizella," Why, that's my slipper!"
Anastasia," Well, I like that! It-it's my slipper!"
Gus," No, no, no! Cinderelly's slipper! Sit!"
Drizella, How can she---
Lady Tremaine," Girls, girls! Your manners. A thousand pardons, Your Grace. Please continue."
Grand Duke," Yes, quite so. (reading) It is upon this day decreed that a quest be instituted throughout the length and breadth of our domain...the sole and express purpose of the quest to be as follows...that every single maiden in our beloved kingdom, without prearranged exception, shall try upon her foot this aforementioned slipper of glass. (Jaq and Gus sneak over to the pocket) And should one be found upon whose foot said slipper shall properly fit...such maiden shall be acclaimed the object of this search and immediately forthwith shall be locked upon as the one and only true love of His Royal Highness, our beloved son and heir, the Noble Prince. (Gus lowers Jaq into the pocket) The Noble Prince will humbly and upon bended knee beg, request, or if need be, implore the maiden, that they grant her hand in marriage. (Jaq tries to push the key out, but Gus stops him as Lady Tremaine checks on the key) Well...whereupon, should the aforementioned-made look with favor upon his suit, but shall the happy couple pledge their troth...on...and in just dues, upon the inevitable demise...of His Most Gracious and August Majesty, the King, succeed to the throne, there to rule all over the land...as Kingsland Queen of our beloved kingdom. (Lady Tremaine pats her pocket, inadvertently hitting Jaq with the key) Oh...so be it. (The Grand Duke sits down on a chair)"
Lady Tremaine," You must be quite fatigued, Your Grace. May we offer you some tea? (Gus, hiding in the teacup, sucks his stomach in to prevent tea from pouring on him)"
Grand Duke," What? Tea? Thank you, madam, no. We must proceed with the......the fitting."
Lady Tremaine," Of course, Anastasia, darling. (The messenger tries the slipper on Anastasia's foot, and it seems to fit)"
Anastasia," There! I knew it was my slipper. Exactly my size. I always wear the same size. As soon as I saw it, I said-- (it's revealed the slipper fits over her big toe) Oh! Well...it...it may be a trifle snug today. You know how it is.....dancing all night. I can't understand why. (the messenger pounds the shoe) It's always fit perfectly before. (Jaq pushes the key out while Gus ties his tail around the teapot's spout) I don't think you're half trying! Mother, can you--"
Lady Tremaine," Csendes. Be silent, my darling. We mustn't disturb His Grace. Young man, are you sure you're trying it on the right foot?"
Gus, (a drop of hot tea falls on Gus' butt) YOW!!
Anastasia," Oh, it's the right foot, but it must have shrunk or something. A glass shoe isn't always reliable."
Jaq," C'mon, Gus. Hurry! Up the stairs! Up the stairs! (the two attempt to get the key up the stairs until they hear discordant notes as Anastasia kicks the messenger against the piano)"
Anastasia, Why can't you hold silent a moment?
Grand Duke," (awakens) Oh, my word! Enough of this! (the clamor stops) The next young lady, please."
Jaq," (the two mice have reached the top of the stairs) Hear that, Gus? Hear this?"
Gus, Yup.
Jaq," Run! Run! Must hurry! (They make it to the tower staircase) C'mon, c'mon! Hurry! (Gus looks up at the staircase, and faints from exhaustion) Gus-Gus, Gus-Gus. Aw, c'mon. Look, look. Just up there! C'mon!"
Jaq," Us a-coming, Cinderelly. Us a-coming! Us a-get you out."
Cinderella, You've had the key. How did you ever manage--
Cinderella," (Gasping) Lucifer! Let him go, Lucifer! (Lucifer snickers) Please, let him go! Let him go."
Jaq," Let him go! Let him out! Let him out! Here! Here, R-ucifee! (Bites Lucifer's tail. The other mice fight back, but Lucifer fights off their forks and blows out their battering candle. The birds drop dishes on Lucifer while Gus remains trapped)"
Cinderella," (gets an idea) Bruno...yes! Bruno! Run, get Bruno! Get Bruno! (two bluebirds fly out the window to fetch Bruno)"
Drizella," (the messenger is yet trying to get the slipper to fit on Drizella) Oh, of all the foolish little idiots! (hits the messenger with her shoe) I'll do it myself! Get away from me! I'll make it fit! (deforms her foot where it fits) There!"
Lady Tremaine, It fits!
Grand Duke, It fits? (the slipper flies away and the Grand Duke manages to catch it with his finger) Whew!
Lady Tremaine," Oh, Your Grace, I'm dreadfully sorry. It shan't happen again."
Grand Duke," Precisely, madam."
Jaq," (he and the other mice lift up the bowl to see Gus is grasping the key) C'mon, c'mon!"
Mice," Get up, Gus-Gus! Get up, get up!"
Gus," No, no, no, no, no!"
Jaq, C'mon! Let go of me! (uses her key to unlock Cinderella's door)
Grand Duke," You are the only ladies of the household, I hope-- (catches himself) I presume."
Lady Tremaine," There's no one else, Your Grace."
Grand Duke, Quite so. Good day. Good day!
Cinderella, Your Grace? Your Grace! Please! Wait! May I try it on? (descends the stairs)
Lady Tremaine," Oh, pay no attention to her."
Anastasia, It's only Cinderella.
Drizella, Our scullery maid.
Anastasia, From the kitchen.
Drizella, It's ridiculous. Impossible.
Anastasia, She's out of her mind.
Lady Tremaine," Yes, yes. Just an imaginative child."
Grand Duke," Madam, my orders were every maiden! Come, my child. (he pulls up the chair for Cinderella)"
Grand Duke," Oh, dear! Oh, dear, oh, dear! Oh, dear! This is horrible. (suddenly becomes fearful) The King! What will he say? What will he do?"
Cinderella," But maybe, if it would help----"
Grand Duke," No, no. Nothing can help now, nothing."
Cinderella," But you see, I have the other slipper."
Chorus," (Sings) Have faith in dreams and someday, your rainbow will come shining through. No matter how your heart is grieving, if you keep on believing, the dreams that you wish will come truuuuue!"
 FABULOUS GODMOTHER," Once upon a time... ...there was an old-fashioned kingdom bound by tradition. Here, everyone had a part to play, and they played it without question. Little did they know, their world was about to change. (laughs) But until it did, y'all...

I'm sorry, I-I was just... About to make an excuse? I could truly care less. Grab your things. Try not to make us late. The changing of the guard waits for no one. Cinderella? Yeah? Do you think I look pretty? I think you look so pretty. But... honestly, who cares what I think? Who cares what anyone thinks? What matters is how you feel when you look in the mirror. That's deep. How do I feel... about myself? Uh... Yeah, I do. I feel pretty. Cool. You have dirt on your face. (Malvolia laughing) Please, girls, we're going to be late. What is that? It's a dress. I made it. - Why? - I don't know. I-I just thought, since the whole kingdom will be there today, I could find someone who will maybe buy it. (laughter) To think that any girl, let alone you, would have the audacity to engage in matters of business, it's insane. I will not have you embarrassing this household with your blasphemy. Don't ever let me catch you trying such nonsense again. Put the dress down. Yes, Stepmother. Good. Now... shoulders back. - (grunts) - No slouching. And smile. Every girl is worth more when she smiles. (sighs) (door closes) What are you doing? I am stewing in my own anger. (softly): Oh, okay. You turned down the daughter of Lord Reginald. I guess she wasn't the one. She was! I would've had control of all the territories right up to the domain of the sea monster. Well, perhaps you should marry the sea monster, Robert. I would have to have grandmother's ring resized. (laughs) You keep overlooking his behavior, - and he'll never grow out of it. - Stop. He's gonna make a fine king. Is it me, or is your throne just a little bit taller - than it was yesterday? - (sputtering sigh) - I mean, it really looks... - Oh, don't be ridiculous. - Quite a bit. - And even if it is, I have every right to make it taller. I'm king. Mm. Yes. And I am ridiculous. If you need me, I shall be in my chambers. Brushing my hair. Until it all falls out. So we good? 'Cause I got a thing. Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh. You're bringing shame on this family, Robert. Have you seen this? ROBERT: ""The Roundabout Players present The King's Idiot Son."" (chuckles): Ooh, do you think we can still get tickets? I'm becoming a laughingstock. I think you're overreacting. Well, why don't you ask the Roundabout Players if I'm overreacting? They are currently in a dark windowless room under the castle. You can't leave actors alone in a basement without attention. They'll die! When you marry, you'll settle down. You'll stop behaving like my idiot son, and the perception of the people will be that you take the crown seriously. - You can't control me. - (choir singing in distance) Oh, that's exactly what I can do. That's the perk of being the king. But I feel nothing for these women. It's crazy to think I'm actually gonna fall in love with one of them. Kings marry for power, - not for love. - (choir continues singing) Oh, well, it's perfect then that Mother came with three castles and a hundred horses, or I suppose I never would've been born! - Silence! - (choir gasps) Don't talk about what you don't understand. Hmm? Continue to defy me, and just out of spite, I'll give it all... the crown, the palace, everything... to your sister. CHOIR: ♪ Bum-bum-bum ♪ Leave us, Gwen. Sorry. I would be embarrassed if I wasn't so bored with my life. But since I'm here, I would love to stay and help sort out this whole crown issue. You've been excused, Gwen. Right. But would this be a good time for me to mention how the kingdom could use the power of the wind - instead of burning filthy coal? - Go! Father, you know how badly I want to be king. I do. (chuckles softly) Now, to make sure your nuptials are done properly and on my schedule, we shall hold a ball. - ♪ A ball? ♪ - No. ♪ Balls are fun ♪ Yes. We'll invite every woman of worth. You'll dance. You'll be charming. You shall find a bride. - Hmm? - No, no, no. D-Dancing at these things is so... mannered. And formal. We look like fools! Of course we do. But women love it. Good God, Robert, if a rich man ever lost a woman, it was to a man who could dance. Why do I have to explain everything to you? This is insane! I can't just pick some bride at a ball. And then what? (laughs): We're-we're supposed to grow old together? Into our s? I mean, what are we even gonna talk about? You will go to the ball. You will find someone. That's an order. Now, go dress.

It's not that I don't want to be king. When I was little, I remember watching my father go off to war and thinking how... brave he looked in his armor. And I wanted to be just like him.

I mean, come on. (mice squeaking) I can hear you. I bet you're arguing about why I didn't just say yes to marrying Robert. Especially since I'm maybe in love with him. JOHN: Love? It was one night. - (shushes) - (yelps) I never felt what I felt last night before. I mean, you guys, he's so handsome. - Oh, yes, he is incredibly handsome. - Absolutely. - Annoyingly handsome. - The cheekbones. And he likes me for me. Sounds like true love to this mouse. You're right, my friend. But if saying yes to him means saying no to this... ...I can't do it. All right, guys? I have to try and make a life for myself, by myself. Because that is what I want. And Queen Tatiana is my chance. Right. - Who's Queen Tatiana? - (knocking) VIVIAN: Cinderella, are you down there? - Stepmother? - Dear God, no. - She scares me. - Me, too. - (knocking) - VIVIAN: Hello. - I'm waiting for my tea. Cinderella. Oh, I'm coming down. (squeaking) I'm sick. Uh-huh. Well, you didn't miss much at the ball. The prince was fixated on some mystery girl. Then she ran away like a twit. So now he's to marry Princess Laura of Northphalia the day after next. (sighs) Malvolia and Narissa, they never stood a chance. And I was so foolish to believe differently. A mother just gets carried away. I know I've been hard on you. It's not fueled by spite. I've never shared this with anyone before, but... I used to play piano. Taught myself. And I was good. I was really good. Nothing made me happier. Then one day, I was given the opportunity to train at the finest school of music, and I took it. (chuckles softly) There I was... two children, a loving husband, and I had the audacity to want more. It was just a month... one month. And yet, when I returned, my husband, well... ...he believed real wives didn't act so frivolously. You may think me cruel. But the real cruelty would be for me to allow you to think that you can be something you can't. (gasps) (mice squeaking) This shoe. It was you. Cinderella. I don't know how you did what you did last night, but the prince chose you. He loves you. Marry him, and all of our problems will be solved. I can't. I told him I didn't want to marry him. Tell him you were wrong. Tell him... tell him it's all you want. If not for yourself, then-then do it for us. For your family. I can help our family, Stepmother. I can provide for us. Don't be so stupid. Who taught you to think that way? Please, Cinderella, don't throw away this opportunity. Go back to him. It's too late. He's marrying someone else. It's over. Fine.

Have you ever wondered why Robert makes the process to marry so difficult? Because he's a spoiled child who refuses to grow up. Simple. I believe it's because of the example set before him by us. A marriage without love, without respect. Bea, please, you know I love you. Saying ""love"" and showing love are two very different things, Rowan. Before you were king, I felt your love every day. You couldn't stand to be away from me, even for a moment. Remember, you used to appear at my window like a knight in shining armor and you'd serenade me with your skull-splitting voice. We were young. Things... change. No. You changed. The crown changed you. You're so worried to look a fool. So obsessed with your reputation, with your legacy. Well, it's only my life's work. It causes me a great deal of stress. Do you think you're the only person who feels stress? God, try being your bloody wife. It is utterly exhausting to sit next to you and just smile as if I were nothing more than a prop, my voice completely silenced. I mean, what I wouldn't give to say, ""You're wrong,"" in front of the entire kingdom. Bea... you're being unreasonable now. Well, if you say so. After all, you're the king. Can't be any other opinions other than yours. Do you know, there's never a guarantee with a couple in our position. But we had love, Rowan. We had it. And now... Robert's wiser than both of us. (knocking) Hello. I'm ready. You summoned me, Your Highness? We can't have a regular conversation like a normal father and son, can we? No, no. To satisfy your power trip, you have to sit there on your slightly too tall throne. You-you belittle me in your... (deep voice): your-your king voice, yes.

I, King Rowan... Am I doing the king voice? A little bit. You can't help yourself. Go find the owner of this glass slipper. And if she'll take you back, then marry her. Or don't. It's your life, son.

I'm sorry if my decision disrupts - your plans for succession. - Well, that's all right. It just so happens I share blood with another who, one day, will be the greatest leader the realm has ever known. Hear that, Gwen? What's happening? - Gwen, my darling girl. - (Beatrice chuckles) I hereby place you first in line to inherit the crown, hmm? Don't stab me in my sleep. I... shall be king? Eh, queen. I'll take it. Good. Just so we're clear, I'm going to rule the land? - Yes. - Okay. And everyone heard that? - We did. Yes. - Yes. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. (chuckles): Oh! So many ideas! Like... Oh, I don't know where to begin! Oh, good. Can I take this crown off? - Yes. - Shall we have some tea? (crowd cheering) GWEN: It is my honor to guide this kingdom forward into a new era. And to pay my deepest respects to my brother, Prince Robert, and his new... What are we calling you? Well... I mean, we don't have to put a label on it. Just... in love? (mutters): I don't know. In love? Yeah. In love. And his new love, Ella! (cheering and applause) Ella. I believe this belongs to you. My mother's brooch. I thought it could inspire you on your voyage. Thank you. All right, that's enough mirth. Celebration's over. - Everyone, go home. - (crowd groaning, protesting) - Oh, man. - Back to work. - Come on. Let's go. - No!

FABULOUS GODMOTHER, And so we've reached the end of this fairy tale.
FABULOUS GODMOTHER," Okay, okay, dang."
Flint, (Voiceover) My name is Flint Lockwood. My whole life I always wanted to be a great inventor. Just like my hero.
TV Announcer," The Scientifically Wonderful World of Science. With your host, Chester V."
Chester V," Welcome back, science friends. You know, I have devoted my life to inventing the future. But every dream has a beginning. (Chester his picture of young himself inventing The Humble Food Bar) I still remember my first invention: ""The Humble Food Bar""."
Flint, (Young) Whoa!
Flint, (Voiceover) It was like Chester V was speaking directly to me using the language of science.
Chester V," Now look at us. Our new Food Bar XL with flavor crystals. Still making people happy after all these years. Now, kids, you'll almost certainly never be me. But, remember, there's no such thing as small science. Only small scientists!"
Children," We love you, Chester V!"
Chester V," Why Speaking of small scientists, say goodbye, Barb."
Barb," Goodbye, Barb."
Chester V," Ha, ha, ha! (The Chester V head coming up and saying his catchphrase) Can your ideas change the world?"
Flint, (Young) Yes.
Flint," (Voiceover) Just like Chester V, my dream was to make the world a better place."
Flint, (Young) Spray-On Shoes! Voila!
Brent," (Young) How you gonna get them off, nerd?"
Flint," (Voiceover) Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't believe in me. But I never gave up. And eventually, I invented this:"
Flint, A machine that could turn water into food.
FLDSMDFR, Cheeseburger.
Flint," It's called the Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator. Or, for short: The FLDSMDFR."
Flint," (Voiceover) Because of my invention's food weather, I finally made the world a better place."
Cal, Yeah!
Sam, I love it!
Flint," (Voiceover) Or so I thought. When the weather evolved into a disaster of epic portions, and the machine started creating dangerous living food I had to face the truth: It was time to put an end to my FLDSMDFR."
FLDSMDFR, Chee-- Chee-- Chee-- Chee-- Cheese.
Flint," (Voiceover) By destroying my greatest invention, I made something even better: Friends!"
Flint and Sam, Wow...
Tim," You made me very proud, son."
Flint," Unh! Thank you, Dad."
Tim, Sorry.
Flint," Sam Sparks, in the eight minutes since we saved the world, I've had time to reflect. And I think you and I should have a place together."
Sam, A Place?
Flint, A place where we work.
Sam, You think we work together?
Flint, I do.
Sam, Awesome! Yes!
Flint, We could build a lab. 
Sam, With cool weather forecasting devices!
Flint, We can invent fantastic machines like the FLDSMDFR.
Sam, Yeah! But not that one.
Flint and Sam," No. Not ever. Never, ever, ever!"
Flint, What shall we call our lab?
Sam, Oh! How about Sparkswood?
Flint, Ooh! Sparkswood.
Earl, Sparkswood is gonna need some security.
Brent, And I can be your mascot!
Tim, And I can be your dad.
Manny, There are many ways in which I can help.
Flint," Ho, ho! Can't forget you, lab partner."
Steve, Steve!
Sam, Where'd he get the brown crayon?
Flint, This could be our future.
Anyone," Oh, yeah! Ha, ha!"
Chester V," Greetings, friends. And namaste."
Sam, Whoa. Is that...?
Flint, Chester V?
Steve, Mustache.
Chester V, Please have some humanitarian aid as a gesture of our goodwill.
Flint, Chester V! Whoa! Your lab vest looks even cooler in person!
Chesquanautter V, Thank you. The lack of sleeves frees up my arms to do this.
Flint," Whoa! Ah! Hand, what did you do?"
Chester V," There's nothing wrong with your hand, young Lockwood. You see, I am merely a hologram of the real Chester V. The United Nations has asked me and my Thinkquanauts to assist in the cleanup and containment of the leftovers all over the world. Including your Swallow Falls. We'll get started on the cleanup right away. As soon as you all leave."
Tim, What? You need us to leave?
Earl," Listen up, ghost man, you expect us to skedaddle from our homes because of some nasty leftovers?"
Chester V," Yes. Yes, I do."
Earl," Son, you can't argue with yellow police tape. Everybody back up! Listen to ghost man."
Chester V," But do not fret. All of you will be temporarily relocated to sunny San Franjose, California!"
Flint and Sam, The home of Live Corp!
Chester V," On my word as a hologram, you shall all return home before you know it. Except for you, Flint Lockwood."
Flint, Me? Why?
Chester V," Oh, heh, heh. You are going--"
Flint," Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. Where am I going? Oh, please tell me!"
Thinkquanaut, Just give it a second. He's buffering.
Chester V, You are going to join me at Live Corp and help us make the world a better place.
Flint," Sir, that's all I've ever wanted. But I can't. On account of making a promise two minutes ago to build a lab with my friends, sir."
Chester V," I understand, Lockwood. But if you become a Thinkquanaut like me, then all your dreams will come true."
Sam, You have to do this!
Flint, What about our dream?
Brent," Flint, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. We're all behind you."
Flint, Are you guys sure?
Sam, Sure.
Flint, This is the best day ever!
Chester V Hologram," Sir, I've taken care of everything. The locals have been evacuated."
Chester V, Splendid. And the inventor?
Chester V Hologram," Oh, he took the job."
Chester V, Outstanding! Now we can keep an eye on him. He has no idea of our real plan. Contact me as soon as Operation Capture the Invention succeeds.
Female Announcer, Live Corp.
FLDSMDFR, Cheeseburger.
Flint," Oh, big day, big day! Big day, big day, big day! Yes! Wake up, Steve!"
Steve, Steve.
Flint, Do I look like a future Thinkquanaut?
Tim," Morning there, skipper. You want a sardine scramble?"
Flint," No, thanks! Can't be late!"
Tim, Flint! Ask that Chester V when he thinks we can go home again.
Flint," Morning, Sam!"
Sam," Morning, Flint! Are you ready for your first day?"
Flint, Yeah! Are you?
Sam, Whoa!
Flint, Sam?
Flint," Well, this is me. Good luck with your new jobs, guys."
Earl," Good luck, Flint!"
Brent," Break a leg, Flint!"
Flint, Bye!
Manny, Adios.
Flint, Wow!
Barb," Good morning, Flint Lockwood and lab partner. I'm Barb. Eeh!"
Flint," I know, I'm a huge fan."
Steve, Monkey.
Barb," Excuse me, I'm an ape. One of Chester V's most brilliant innovations. An orangutan with a human brain within my ape brain. Like a turducken. I'll be your welcome ambassador. Soy latte?"
Flint, Okay. Coffee and milk?
Barb, Are you ready to live?
Flint," Oh, am I!"
Steve, Monkey.
Barb," Ape. Follow me, boys."
Barb, Welcome to Live Corp.
Flint, Wow.
Barb, There are caffeine stations every 10 feet. Soy-free soy latte?
Flint, Thanks!
Steve, Hot.
Scientist," Not too bad yourself, monkey."
Barb," Caffeine patches are available 24 hours. And our mocha-yoga classes are offered in beginner or grande. Over here, indoor sports. Those are encouraged."
Flint," Oh, cool! I've never played volleyball."
Barb," Well, neither have they. You'll fit right in!"
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Barb," Behold, the motivation pod."
Chester V, Can your ideas...?
Barb," I know, right? Quinoa latte?"
Flint," Absolutely! Ha, ha, ha!"
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Flint," Yes, Chester V poster, they can!"
Scientists, Mine too! So can mine! I have great ideas. Absolutely! I've got my idea pants on.
Flint," Thinkquanauts! Awesome! Hey! Excuse me, I'm so looking forward to working with you guy-- Uh! Aww! That's where we belong, Steve."
Steve, Anxious!
Barb," Oh, heh, heh. That's not even a possibility until our next vesting ceremony."
Flint, What's that?
Barb, That's where Chester V handpicks a great inventor and makes him into a Thinkquanaut.
Flint, When? When?
Barb," Next one's in six months, so submit your ideas and who knows? He might choose you."
Flint, Really? Hot chocolate with double-whipped whipped cream? Thanks.
Barb, Happy inventing!
Flint, We're gonna have to get used to that landing.
Flint," Okay, Steve, we have six months until the vesting ceremony. Let's do this thing."
Steve, Can.
Flint," That's the spirit, Steve!"
Flint, Say goodbye to ice cubes with the Re-Freeze-a-Fan!
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Flint, The Forkenknifenspooninator!
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Flint, The Grocery Deliverator!
Tim, Whoa!
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Flint, Invisible coffee table!
Tim, Ah! Flint.
Chester V, Can your ideas change the world?
Tim, Flint!
Flint," The Celebrationator! A party in a box for any occasion. Okay, Steve, time to celebrate! Celebrate!"
Tim, Flint!
Everyone," Happy birthday, Tim Lockwood!"
Flint," Here you go, Dad. Hope you like it. Steve picked it out."
Steve, Steve!
Flint," Yeah. Yeah! Okay, like we practiced. When I'm up on stage getting my vest, you hit the red button when I say ""celebrate."""
Steve, Celebrate!
Flint," Whoa. Careful, Steve! This is a loaded party-in-a-box."
Chester V," Hello, Team Live Corp! It's a pleasure to welcome you to our annual Thinkquanaut vesting ceremony!"
Flint, Whoo! Chester V!
Chester V," Ha, ha, ha. I have built the coolest, hippest company in the world. As you all know, the Food Bar is the lifeblood of this company. And this year, I've challenged myself to reinvent taste."
Flint, Ooh.
Chester V," So in two short weeks, we shall release the new Live Corp Food Bar! Version 8.0!"
Flint, Yes!
Chester V," And now, without further ado, who will be this year's newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut?"
Flint," Oh, ho, ho! Yeah!"
Chester V," We have received thousands of invention submissions and today, one of them will be deemed Thinkquanaut-worthy. Thank you, Barb."
Flint, Whoo!
Chester V, This person comes from an island. He's got a memorable mop of unruly hair. 
Steve,Hair. Hair! 
Flint,"Ha, ha, ha! That's me!"
Chester V,Our newest Live Corp Thinkquanaut is: Flint--
Flint,Yeah!
Chester V,--ly McCallahan!
Flint,No.
Man,Crikey blikey! Yes!
Chester V,For inventing a zero-emission car that runs on cute.
Man,This is the greatest day of my life! Didgeridoo! I'm finally a real inventor!
Flint,"Sorry, Steve. No reason to celebrate."
Steve,Celebrate!
Flint,"Wait, Steve, no, no, no. No!"
Flint,"Hi, Sam, it's Flint. I see you're live on TV with a tornado. Probably why you're not answering the phone."
News Anchor,Thinkquanaut? I think not.
Flint,Ugh. Please call me back. Okay. Bye!
Barb,"Bad news! Sir, we lost contact with Search Teams X and Y."
Chester V,What?
Barb,"Yeah! The situation is grim, sir. Still no sign of the FLDSMDFR. Should I send in Team Z?"
Chester V,"Are you mad, Barb? We'll be all out of alphabet. Look, we're running low on Thinkquanauts. We need someone expendable. Someone who knows the island inside and out. Someone who's smart, but still naive. Someone who idolizes me, has recently hit rock bottom and will now do just about anything I ask."
Barb,Where are we gonna find someone so desperate?
Chester V,I think we already have.
Steve,Sprinkles! Fire!
Tim,"Flint, who's number one? Oh. Ta-da!"
Sam,"Hey, Flint, I got your message. Oh, no, what happened to you?"
Sam,"Flint, everyone gets humiliated on national television. It's not that big a deal."
Flint,"Yeah, but not everyone gets humiliated in front of their childhood hero. I'll never be a real inventor in Chester's eyes. Mom gave me this lab coat because she always dreamed I'd do great things. Now I guess I won't."
Tim,Now that's a big bucket of churn.
Sam,"Flint, you don't need Chester's approval. You can still make the world a better place without an orange vest."
Tim,I don't get vests. Is it winter on your torso and summer on your arms?
Sam,"For what it's worth, the people who really care about you think you look great in your lab coat. Good night, Mr. Lockwood."
Tim,"Good night, my dear. Hey, look, son. This Chester V guy. He promised us we'd be home before we know it. Well, we darn sure know it and we're not home. So I say you, me and your friends, we take the boat. We can go fishing every day. And if there's still a mess on the island, we can go clean it up ourselves."
Flint,"Dad, please. I'm not into fishing. And cleanup? You're way too old to be doing that kind of work."
Tim,I'm only 49.
Barb,"Flint Lockwood, please."
Tim,"Oh, Flint. Um... There's. Could you come to the door, please? I think it's that monkey in your poster."
Flin,What? No! Ahh! Barb?
Barb,Shh.
Chester V,Good day. I'm afraid I have something very important to discuss with you.
Voice,Live Corp.
Flint,Chester V wants to see me?
Barb,Follow me.
Flint,Whoa.
Hologram,Ah. Young Lockwood.
Flint,Chester V. Sir. I can explain everything. I thought I was gonna meet the real Chester V.
Hologram,You are.
Holograms,"Oh, not me. Him."
Chester V,"Yes, it's me. Sorry about that. My holograms and I were having an urgent brainstorming session."
Flint,Aah! Mr. V! You're real! I'm so excited to get this opportunity to show you my inventions.
Chester V,"Hold on. Hold on. That's not why I brought you here tonight. Our cleanup operation back on Swallow Falls has met with unexpected complications. This is a photograph before we began our cleanup. And this was three days ago. It gets worse, Flint."
Thinkquanaut,There's only two of us left. We need help.
Flint,What is that thing?
Steve,Cheesy. 
Chester V,It appears to be a living cheeseburger with french fry legs and sesame seed eyes.
Flint,"Living food? Oh, no. This could only mean one thing. The FLDSMDFR <span class=""new"" data-uncrawlable-url=""L3dpa2kvQ2xvdWR5X3dpdGhfYV9DaGFuY2Vfb2ZfTWVhdGJhbGxzXyhmaWxtKT9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE="" title=""Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs (film) (page does not exist)"">survived the explosion</span>, and it's still operating."
Chester V,"This is what worries me most. They're trying to learn to swim. If they succeed and get to the mainland, they will destroy monuments all around the world including the one monument your food storm didn't destroy."
Flint,Not Lady Liberty! I've gotta destroy the FLDSMDFR. But how?
Chester V,"Well, my Thinkquanauts have invented this. The BS-USB. Or BSUSB."
Flint,A Bifurcating Systematic Universal Stop Button!
Chester V,Precisely. It would destroy the machine and everything it created. But we cannot find your FLDSMDFR. We've searched everywhere and failed.
Flint,"Chester, I'll find the machine. I invented it. I can fix this!"
Chester V,Brilliant! But are you sure you want to take this on alone?
Flint,"Yes! Wait, did you say ""alone""?"
Chester V,"Alone it is, then. If you succeed, you'll be more than just a Thinkquanaut. You'll be my hero."
Flint,Your hero?
Chester V,"Yes, my hero. Your mission must be kept a secret. We don't wanna create a worldwide panic. You mustn't tell anyone, not even your closest friends and family."
Flint,"Sir, I won't tell a soul."
Flint,"Sam! Sam, Sam, Sam! I gotta tell you a secret! Sam! Big news. I'm going to Swallow Falls to destroy the FLDSMDFR, which is creating deadly food monsters, which are trying to learn to swim so they can attack Lady Liberty! Sam?"
Sam,"Wait, you're doing this alone?"
Sam,"Well, I'm coming."
Flint,What? No! I promised Chester V I would go alone. There's no talking you out of this?
Sam,Nope.
Flint,"Wait. Sam, it's gonna be deadly dangerous with a good chance of death."
Sam,And that's why we'll need help!
Earl,Triple decaf mochaccino-boba-latte with skim soy and nutmeg sprinkle?
Flint,I'd like to order something strong.
Earl,"Wait your turn, fancy pants. Flint Lockwood and Sam Sparks! And Steve too!"
Steve,Juicy!
Flint,"Earl, we need your help."
Sam,Swallow Falls is overrun with deadly food monsters.
Man,"Hey, where's my coffee?"
Earl,"Coffee? I'm not a barista, I'm a polista! Let's ride!"
Cal,"Can I come too, Dad?"
Earl,"Son, you are my beautiful, precious little angel. But I cannot let you come with me. Not until you get your first chest hair."
Cal,:I have chest hair.
Earl,It's just like mine. Wait a minute. That's not a chest hair. That's cupcake frosting. Tell your mom I'm getting our home back.
Cal,What's up?
Manny,Sponge. Forceps. A swab.
Sam,Manny. We need your help.
Manny,I can drop everything. Camera.
Brent,Chick 'n' sushi Get it while it's cold. Hoo!
Flint,"Yo, Chicken Brent!"
Brent,In the flesh. Ba-gawk-oh!
Sam,Swallow Falls is in trouble. Will you help us?
Brent,"You bet I will. I just need someone to cover my shift. Thanks, tree."
Flint,"Okay, gang. We'll be traveling to the island using my Grocery Deliverator! All right, who wants to go first?"
Steve,Hungry.
Flint,"Yes, Steve, hungry for adventure. See you on the island, my brave lab partner."
Steve,Afraid!
Flint,It worked!
Steve,Banana! Banana! Banana! Steve!
Flin,I guess it only works on food. I gotta fix that.
Tim,"Ahoy there, skipper, my boy."
Flint,Dad.
Others,:Mr. Lockwood?
Flint,"Dad, no. How did you know we were here?"
Tim,"I could see you from the apartment. Flint, if you're going home, so am I."
Flint,The island's gonna be very dangerous--
Tim,"I was born on the island, and I wanna die on that island, just like your mom. Besides, I know that place like the inside of a tackle box. I wanna help."
Flint,No!
Sam,"Flint, let him help."
Earl,The man does have a boat.
Brent,Which is twice as many boats as we have.
Manny,Vamanos.
Flint,Fine. But we'll get there faster if we use the Grocery Deliverator.
Steve,Steve!
Flint,"Aah! Okay, okay, we'll take the boat!"
Tim,Shoving off! Ninety-nine buckets Of chum on a boat Ninety-nine buckets Of chum Nineteen buckets of chum on a boat Nineteen buckets of chum You hold your nose And out one goes There's 18 buckets of chum on a boat We'll be there in two flaps of a sardine's fluke! 
Flint,"Thanks, Dad! Okay, when we land at Swallow Falls, our first objective is to get to my lab. I can use my old computer to pinpoint the FLDSMDFR's location. Once we find it, we can shut it down with the utterly irreplaceable BS-USB."
Brent,What if you don't find it?
Flint,"I have to. It's my machine. If the world gets destroyed by these, it's my fault. I can't let that happen."
Tim, Land ho! Land ho!
Flint," If we work together, this should be easy as-- "
Manny,Pie.
Flint,"Oh, no! We're-- "
Sam,Toast! 
Earl,French toast! 
Flint,This is totally--
Steve, Bananas! 
Flint,"I was gonna say ""nuts,"" but now I'm afraid to. "
Brent,Uh-oh. 
Steve, Home! - 
Flint,"No! Steve, wait! The jungle's no place for a monkey. "
Steve,"Home, home, home! "
Sam,"Manny, are you getting this? "
Manny,I certainly am. 
Sam,Flint. Look! The climate has shifted dramatically to allow this much vegetation to grow! 
Flint,Aah! Sam! Ratbirds!
Tim,"Okay, then. All ashore that's going ashore."
Flint,"Dad, this place is really dangerous. I'd feel better if you stayed here on the boat where it's safe."
Tim,Safe? I wanna help.
Flint,I'd never forgive myself if you got eaten by a cheespider.
Earl,"He's right, Tim Lockwood. Don't worry, we'll get your home back."
Tim,"Well, fine."
Flint,"Thanks, Dad. We'll try to be back before suppertime, okay?"
Tim,Sure.
Flint,Whoa. Look what's happened to our town.
Earl,Look. There's my angel son Cal's old preschool.
Manny,My old van.
Brent,Look! An old thing that I've never seen before!
Flint,That's where the Thinkquanauts were attacked by a cheespider.
Brent,"It's like a cheesy spider web, made of cheese. Let's get out of here!"
Sam,"No, wait. What if there's a survivor in there?"
Earl,"Stand back, everybody. I'm gonna cut the cheese. Uh... That was the cheese. Hello? Anybody in here? "
Brent,Sorry.
Flint,Wow.
Sam,That is the biggest strawberry I've ever seen in my life.
Brent,Is it heavy?
Flint,"Yeah. But other than that it looks like a perfectly normal, fresh, delicious strawberry.  "
Barry,N-woo? 
Flint,AHHHH!!! 
Brent,Oooohhhh....It's moving! 
Flint,"Heh, heh. Oh, that was a close one."
Sam,You got a little someone stuck to your pants.
Flint,Ah! Get it off! Get it off me! Sam! Sam! 
Sam,"Hey, wait, wait. "
Flint,"Stop! Sam, don't touch it! Put it down! Put it down!"
Sam,Look at him.
Flint,AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!
Sam,Seriously? Aww. I think I'll name him Barry! 
Flint,"Okay, Sam, could you please put ""Barry"" down? Look, we have to get to the FLDSMDFR so we can shut it down with this utterly irreplaceable BS-USB. "
Flint,Hey! That's not for you! I need that. Please? That BS-USB is really important.
Barry, N-woo? 
Flint,N-woo. Yes.
Barry,N-woo.
Flint,"Hi, N-woo. Hey, you wanna hand it to me, buddy? I beg you.  Please? "
Barry,N-woo. 
Flint,"N-woo, N-woo. Yes. Yes. There you go. No! Don't let him get away! Stop! Stop! Gotcha. Aah! Here, you take it, you take it. You're gonna have to carry him until he passes the BS-USB. "
Sam,"And by ""pass,"" you mean... "
Flint,"Yes. Look, we better get a move on before we run into any more of these creatures."
Sam,Oh! It's so beautiful.
Earl,"It's enough to make a grown man cry. But not this man. Get back in there, tear."
Flint,"Wow, I can't believe the FLDSMDFR created all of this. Ah! Where's Barry? "
Barry,"Whee. Ha, ha, ha! "
Earl,Uh-oh. 
Flint,"Just a little bit closer. I can get him. Come on, Earl, faster. "
Sam,Look at the mangos. 
Flint,You mean flamingos. Flamangos! 
Brent,There's a bunch of shrimp! 
Manny,They look like chimpanzees. 
Both,Shrimpanzees! 
Earl,Those are some tasty-looking jellyfish! 
Brent,Oh! What's that one over there? 
Sam,That's just a tomato. 
Flint,BARRY! COME ON! Chester gave me that BS-USB. It's really important. 
Steve,Shrimpanzee. Steve. Shrimpanzee. Steve. Shrimpanzee. Shove. Steve.
Flint,There's a leek in the boat! 
Earl,"Hold on, everyone. This ain't gonna be no picnic.  "
Flint,"Stop! Get back here! Keep it steady, Earl. "
Sam, Watermelophants!  
Flint,"Barry, grab my hand! Barry! "
Earl," Freeze, berry man.  "
Flint,"Thanks, Earl. Ugh.  "
Sam,"Okay, come here. You have caused enough trouble for one day. "
Brent,Susheep! 
Manny,Cantalopes. 
Sam,I can't believe your machine reprogrammed itself to create this entire ecosystem of living food. How is that even possible? 
Flint,I have no idea. Best we don't think about it. The world should know about this.
Sam," Manny, is your camera still working? "
Manny,Of course. I've been rolling - since we landed. - 
Barb,So much for keeping this a secret.  
Chester V,We can't let these friends tell the world anything. What we need to do is go there and separate Flint from his friends so we can manage the situation.  
Holograms,"Champion! Brilliant idea. Way to go, Chester.  "
Chester V,"Thank you. Barb, you take care of that weather girl. "
Barb," But, sir, I'm a scientist. "
Chester V, That's why I need you. I want the same brilliant mind that solved the unified field theory to help me help Live Corp 
Barb,". Consider it done, sir. "
Chester V, Good monkey. To the Helpicopter.  
Flint,"Oh, Earl. Pull over there.  "
Earl,Duck!  
Brent,"Duck? I love-- Ba-gawk!  Whoo-hoo-hoo! Yeah! You guys, that wasn't so bad.  "
Flint,"Yeah, well, be thankful we didn't run into a-- <span class=""new"" data-uncrawlable-url=""L3dpa2kvQ2hlZXNwaWRlcj9hY3Rpb249ZWRpdCZyZWRsaW5rPTE="" title=""Cheespider (page does not exist)"">Cheespider</span>!  "
Earl,Run!  
Steve,Cheesy. Cheesy. Cheesy. 
Earl, Manny!  
Brent,Wait for me! Ba-gawk-oh! 
Earl, I'm glad you still wearing that diaper.  
Brent,I wish I brought a fresh one!  
Flint,"Hey, guys! Down this alley!  "
Sam,"Oh, no! Dead end.  "
Earl,Ghost man?  
Chester V," Greetings, and namaste. "
Flint,Chester V! You're here! 
Chester V,"That's right, young Lockwood. And by the looks of things, just in time. "
Earl,"One minute later, and we would have been food for that food. "
Chester V,"Flint, I thought you said you were going to complete this mission alone. "
Barb,Can I say something? 
Manny,Apparently you can. 
Chester V,"This is Barb, my number two. "
Barb,"Why are you carrying a strawberry in your backpack, miss?"
Chester V,":Stand back, everyone!"
Sam,"Hey, hey, hey, stop. You're scaring him. "
Barb,"Scaring him? Oh, please, it's probably got a mouth full of fangs. "
Brent, Now you're scaring me.  
Sam,I've been carrying him and he hasn't hurt anyone.  
Barb,I'm sorry. Are you a scientist?  
Sam,"Matter of fact, I am.  "
Flint,She's a meteorologist.  
Barb,"Meteorology. Oh, I love it. The science of smiling and having pretty hair while you point at a map. "
Flint, Actually it's a very important job--  
Sam, Meteorology is a comprehensive analysis-- 
Chester V," Ladies, ladies. Please. I'm sure we can all agree that one of you is a scientist. Young Lockwood, why was your lady friend carrying this rabid little strawberry in her backpack?"
Flint," Why is the strawberry guy in the backpack? Well, um, that's funny. Um... It's... Uh... You know what he did? Um... He, uh... He ate the BS-USB. "
Chester V, Not the BSUSB. 
Barb,I'm on it. 
Earl, Watch out! She's got a knife!
Sam,If you touch a leaf on his head... 
Barb,"Step away from the berry, madam. "
Earl,That orange hairy lady scared the jam out of him! 
Flint,"Oh, no, it's jammed. "
Steve,Lick. Lick. Lick. 
Flint,"Oh, thanks, Steve."
Chester V,". Young Lockwood. The world could've been destroyed because of the actions of one sinister strawberry. We cannot allow any more mistakes like this. Oh... It won't be long before those malicious melons, pernicious pickles, and belligerent burgers learn to swim and make their way to the mainland. What is your plan?  "
Flint,I need to get back to my lab so I can make contact with the FLDSMDFR.  
Chester V,Brilliant!  
Earl,I'll lead the way. 
Sentinel," No, we'll lead the way. Safe, safe, safe. "
Chester V, I believe my Sentinels of Safety are better equipped to lead us in their robo-suits.  
Barry,N-woo?  
Tim,"""I'll be back before supper."" What a bunch of baloney. Just leave me on the boat without any food. I know a place where I can get something to eat. There she is. Home sweet home. What? There's no sardines? Had to be looters. Ah. Vintage Baby Brent.  "
Tim,Oh chum. 
Tim,". Yeah. Heh. I like them too. I do. I love them. Mine. No, no. Mine. Off. Off. Mine. No, no, mine. Mine. Off.  "
Tim,"Hey, hey, hey. Easy, you guys. Come on, you could lose an eye.  "
Tim,"Look, I tell you what. You want more sardines? I can get you more sardines.  "
Brent,"Hey, thanks for loaning me these skinny jeans, Flint.  "
Earl,Those aren't skinny jeans.  
Manny,Nope. 
Brent, My feet are turning purple. Is that bad? Uh-oh. 
Flint,Bananostrich! Ah!  
Earl,"Go, go, go! Come on, Brent!  "
Steve,Banana! Banana! Banana!  
Chester V,That bunch of bananostriches nearly split us.  
Sam,Are you okay?  
Flint,"Oh, my gosh. My house!  "
Steve,"Home, home, home!  "
Sam,"Oh, my gosh. Your lab!  "
Flint,"Oh, crap balls.  "
Earl,"We can't go up there, Flint Lockwood. That dangly, upsy-downsy lab's not to code.  "
Flint,"I've got to, if I'm gonna find the FLDSMDFR.  "
Sam,We can do it. Those load-bearing vines will be able to support a small team.  
Chester V,Onwards and upwards!  
Flint,"Right, sir. To the lab! "
Chester V,"Sentinels, keep the locals safe.  "
Earl,I'll keep them safe.  
Brent,"Hey, guys! Where you going? Guys! Hey wait for me! Uh-oh. A little help? "
Steve, Spooky.
Flint," Spooky is right, Steve. "
Chester V,"I say, this laboratory of yours is a wonder of engineering.  "
Flint,"Really? Thank you, sir. Initiating backup power.  "
Voice,"{damaged] Welcome, Flint. "
Flint,"Whoa, my computer's dead. "
Chester V," The fate of the world is depending on us. Think, Lockwood.  "
Flint,"Well, if I could pull the hard drive, there's enough equipment in this lab that I could build a tracking device.  "
Chester V,Flint!  
Flint,Whoa!  
Chester V,"I say, young Lockwood, what extraordinary underpants.  "
Flint," Thank you, sir. They're my Wedgie-proof underwear. I invented them when I was 6. "
Chester V, I had no idea we were so alike. Except I invented mine when I was 3. 
Sam,You guys have been wearing the same underwear since you were kids? 
Both,Yes!
Barb, Excuse me. How do you expect us to get the hard drive with all that electrified water? 
Flint,We dangle! 
Chester V," Come, Lockwood, give the monkey your underpants. "
Barb,What? 
Chester V," Lay on, young Lockwood. "
Flint,"Whoa! Whoa! Yes! Heh, heh. "
Sam,Whoa! 
Chester V,"You know, hanging from my underpants in this space brings back so many memories. I too built my lab up high to keep the bullies out! "
Flint, You were-- You were bullied too? 
Chester V,Absolutely. People like us are always bullied. Sometimes I wish I'd kept my bullies around. Really? So I could crush them with my success. Just like you did with that man-baby. 
Flint,"You mean Brent? Sure, he used to be a bully, but he's my friend now. "
Chester V,Friend? A bully can never be your friend. Never? 
Chester V,Remember the ancient Chinese proverb:[chinese language]
Flint, Huh? 
Chester V," ""Stew offered by a bully is poisoned broth."" "
Flin,"Wow, stew. I have so much to learn. Mission accomplished! "
Chester V," Indeed, young Lockwood. Indeed. "
Blint,"Help! Help! Come on, guys. Get me ou--! "
Flint,"You okay, Earl? "
Earl,My chest hairs have been tingling all day. 
Chester V," Don't worry. Live Corp Sentinels have danger-sensing fibers built into their chest plates. Bravo, Lockwood. With luck, we'll survive the night."
Manny,Sounds like midnight snacks. 
Brent,Dr. Manny! This is delicious! 
Manny,I call it Manny's Gorilla Stew. 
Brent,So how do you make a gorilla stew? 
Manny,You keep it waiting for two hours. 
Flint,"Hey, guys. Oh, that smells good."
Grent,"Hey, Flint! Wanna try some of this special stew? I saved you a bowl. It's killer."
Flint,"Killer stew. [Chester speaking chinese] No! Thank you, Brent."
Earl,"Ever since that ghost man showed up, Flint Lockwood's been acting--"
Steve,Jerky.
Manny,He rejected my stew. No one has ever rejected my stew. 
Sam,"I'm gonna go talk to him. Flint, wait up."
Flint,"Yeah, Sam?"
Sam,Is something wrong?
Flint,"Yeah, we blew a fuse."
Sam,You blew a fuse. Why are you being so weird to your friends?
Flint,What? I haven't been weird.
Sam,You karate-chopped Manny's stew out of Brent's hands. You hurt their feelings.
Flint,"Sam, you wouldn't understand. [speaking chinese]"
Sam,"I do understand, but you're forgetting that: [speaking chinese.]"
Flint,Huh? 
Sam,"""A bully turned friend will be friend to the end."" Listen, Brent came here to help you. We all did. And you're acting like we're just in your way. Remember, we work together. "
Chester V,That weather girl is ruining our plan. 
Barb," I just need more time, sir. "
Chester V," We don't have more time. If we don't get the FLDSMDFR in the next 48 hours, we'll miss our deadline to release Food Bar 8.0. I'll be a laughingstock! "
Barb,"Sir, let me handle this."
Chester V,  Never send a monkey to do Chester work. I'll take care of it. 
Tim,"Okay, guys, we're here. Hey, hey, hey! That is not for you. All right, let's get to it. "
Tim,"Okay. You got this, right? Okay. Then you wanna put one of these on there, like that. No, no, no. No, don't eat that. That's bad. You'll hurt yourself. Hey, hey, easy! Stop picking on your brother, will you? How would you like it if he was shoving you? Okay, now watch. Are you watching? One and two and three! Catch the big one! Yeah, good, huh? It's called fishing. "
Tim,Out on my boat With a pickle that likes dill The frowny one's sour He's a real bitter pill She's so sweet With her onion pet Pearl Teaching pickles to fish That's my crazy world
Tim,"I tell you, if only Flint liked fishing as much as you guys. Why am I talking to a pickle?"
Sentinel,Dangerous food creatures detected. Stay put. We'll find and destroy them.
Sam, Barry! You can't be here.
Manny, You better hide him.
Flint," Okay, gang! Today's the day we find the FLDSMDFR. Sam, I was thinking about what you said last night--"
Barry, N-woo?
Flint, What?
Sam, Me too.
Flint," Right. Listen, I have been acting weird, but it's only because I'm under a lot of pressure."
Barry, N-woo?
Flint, What?
Sam, So true!
Flint," But I'm also doing this for us. You see, I still want Sparkswood to happen, but it can't. Not until I become a great inventor like Chester V."
Sam," Flint, you don't have to prove anything--"
Chester V," [drops between Flint and Sam] Ha, ha. Lockwood! How goes the inventing?"
Flint," Uh, very good, sir. Uh, I was up all night making this. I call it the Flint Lockwood Food Jungle Topographical Pointing Machine. Or..."
Chester V, The FLFJTPM! Brilliant!
Flint," Oh, thank you, sir. Follow the beam, find the machine. All I have to do now is cut the leg holes."
Chester V, Ooh.
Sam," Huh. Well, maybe it's better here."
Flint," Great idea, Sam. And, guys, you can help me by--"
Chester V, Excuse us. Your friends are distracting you from our mission.
Flint, Distracting?
Earl, My chest hairs just don't trust that Chester.
Chester V," We should be hunting the FLDSMDFR, not chitchatting."
Flint," But, sir, I--"
Chester V," You're heading into the deepest, darkest part of the jungle. You need to focus on saving the world. Be a hero."
Flint," Okay. You're right, sir."
Chester V, Excellent! Let's go!
Sam,"Okay, Barry, time to go home now. Okay. Okay. Okay, one more hug, Barry. "
Barry,Barry?
Sam,Right! Barry. You Barry.  
Barry,Barry. 
Sam, And I'm Sam Sparks. 
Barry,Saspa. 
Sam,Right! Sam-- 
Sam,"Coming! Okay, Barry, time to go home now. Now go. Now you go on home. Bye."
Barry,Huh? Saspa!
Manny, Tacodile! Supreme!
Earl,Holy guacamole! 
Male Sentinel," I got this, bro! I'm okay! "
Flint,"Up there! Hurry, Sam! Barb! You okay?"
Barb, Uh-huh.
Sentinel, Freeze!
Flint,"Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here! "
Chester V," Bravo, young Lockwood, bravo!"
Sam,A mother?
Flint,Sam!
Barry,Saspa!
Flint, Almost there. The FLDSMDFR should be across this syrup bog.
Brent, [awed] This is syrup? Syrup is my favorite. [smacks a mosquitoast] Darn mosquitoasts!
Chester," Don’t worry, man baby. They, like all the other abominable food monsters, will soon be no more."
Sam," Wait, Flint! What if we’re making... a big mistake?"
Flint, Mistake?
Sam, About shutting off the FLDSMDFR. Some of these creatures... They’re incredible! :
Chester, Incredibly dangerous! We were just attacked by a giant Tacodile!
Flint," He’s right, Sam. I mean, we were almost eaten by a Cheesspider."
Sam, It doesn’t mean we have to destroy all of them. Some of the food’s actually been... friendly.
Manny, It is true. The dessert creatures are especially sweet.
Flint, Okay. Maybe we– [Barb smacks him] Ow! (Why'd you do that for?!)
Barb, Mosquitoast... was gonna bite you.
Chester, See? Even the tiniest creatures are attacking us.
Sam, The only reason they're biting is because of the drop of barometric pressure. Bugs do that before a storm. [refers to the storm clouds] And by the look of those nimbostratus clouds–
Chester," Miss Sparks, we are not talking about the weather. [hits Flint in the tracking helmet] We are talking about food here. Dangerous food that does not have human emotion."
Flint, [A mosquitoast landed on his nose and Chester flicks it out] Ow!
Chester, Food that is not friendly! [slaps Flint in the face and holds his helmet] FOOD THAT CANNOT LOVE!! [slaps Flint's again and pinched his lips]
Sam," Flint, we should be studying the food animals, not killing them. What if he's wrong?"
Chester," [to Flint] The choice is yours, son - live up to your full potential or walk away and let the food monsters destroy Lady Liberty."
Flint," Sam, finding that FLDSMDFR and saving the world... That's what matters."
Sam, [shocked and hurt] Really? Our opinion doesn't matter?
Flint," Of course it does! Yes! Yes, it matters, but... just... just not right now."
Brent," Uh, oh!"
Earl, Wrong answer!
Steve, Toast!
Sam," [angry] Yeah!? [takes the drawn vest sticky note off the drawing of Sparkswood] Well, I guess this doesn't matter, either, young Lockwood. (Does it?!) [pins the sticky note on Flint’s shirt] (You know what?) I’ll just... see you back on the boat. [drops the drawing on the syrup and storms off... well, sort of]"
Flint," (Oh, man.) Wait, Sam! Wait, please! No! No. Sam, come back! Come back, Sam, no! No, Sam, Sam, Sam! Saaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam…!! Oh, boy. Hey, Earl, would you talk to her?"
Earl," [sternly] You bet I will. Hey, Sam, wait for me! [follows Sam]"
Manny," Adios, sayonara. Goodbye, Señor Lockwood. [leaves]"
Brent," [sadly] Bye, Flint. [leaves as well]"
Steve, Steve! [hops onto Manny]
Flint," Et tu, Steve? [his friends leave him on his own with Chester] What just happened? [picks up the drawing from the syrup]"
Chester," You have made the right choice, son. (Now, let's go find your machine.) [to his sentinels] Sentinels, keep them... safe. [grins evilly as he walks off with Flint and Barb while the sentinels march after the gang]"
Butter Frog, Butter.
Chester V," Ah, Young Lockwood, we're getting close. I feel it in my beard!"
Flint,Water goes in the top and food comes out the bottom. It's gotta be inside that big rock candy mountain!
Chester V," This is exactly why I wanted you on this mission. Sally forth, Lockwood."
Sam,I can't believe Flint is still listening to that guy!
Manny,Flint is naive. It appears he is being manipulated for some nefarious purpose.
Sam,Of course he is!
Earl,[after he and the others saw the Cheespider] Sam! Freeze!
Sam,What?
Earl,Stay calm and walk toward me slowly.
Brent,Very slowly.
Sam," Oh, come on. Now you're acting weird. I'm in no mood for this. AHH!"
Earl,"Stop right there, cheese monster! Nobody eats my friends on my watch!"
Sam,"No, wait! Chester's been lying to us about these creatures, and I am going to prove it."
Earl,"Sam, don't do it! It's foodicide!"
Steve,Danger! Danger! Danger!
Sam,Nice cheespider. Ohh. Ugh.
Steve,Yellow.
Brent,Dude! You got special-sauced!
Sam,"It's Okay, guys. See? She's not mean. She's just a little beefy."
Brent,Whoa. What's it doing?
Sam,I think she wants you to scratch her buns.
Brent,Aw. I like that too. Who's a good cheespider? She's cute!
Earl,But why did she attack us before?
Sam,Because we were dressed like them.
Brent,She doesn't like backpacks?
Manny,No. It appears she doesn't like Live Corp. The food creatures know something we do not.
Brent,Who's Evel?
Manny,"Not ""Evel."" Evil."
Sam,I knew it! Chester's up to something terrible. We have to warn Flint!
Earl,Let's ride!
Sam,Run!
Sentinel,You're not warning anyone about anything.
Sam,"Oh, crap balls."
Chester V,Magnificent.
Flint,The FLDSMDFR must be up there.
Chester V," A very unpleasant fall. Finish the job, Lockwood."
Flint,"Yes, sir. Made it! FLDSMDFR. Look, I'm sorry I have to do this to you again. But I can't let your swimming cheespiders destroy Lady Liberty or the world."
Machine voice, Marshmallow.
Flint,They're like a family. Sam was right.  This is a mistake.
Chester V," Oh, dear!"
Flint,"Sir! Uh, sir?"
Chester V, There it is.
Flint,Wait.
Chester V, In all its glory.
Flint,"Chester, look, I can't do this."
Chester V," Oh, okay. I will."
Flint," What? Wait.  Chester, Wait. We can't destroy it. "
Chester V," Let go of me, Lockwood."
Flint,"No, sir, I can't let you do this."
Voice,Live corp..
Flint, The BS-USB... reprogrammed it!?
Chester V, It was never gonna turn off the machine. A BS-USB? Hello! (Duh!) Your machine is what I wanted all along.
Flint, You... lied to me.
Chester V, Of course I lied to you. I knew you'd eventually fall for these pathetic creatures.
Flint," [heartbroken] But… but you were my idol. My whole life, I looked up to you. I wanted to be you! (Why would you do this?)"
Chester V," Oh, Flint. I was just using you to get your invention. We're ready. Launch Operation Slice and Dice. And now that I've got what I want, I no longer need you. I'm afraid we're going to have to let you go."
Flint,"Wait, wait, wait. No, no, please."
Tim," Whoa. That's not natural. [the other pickles started to get scared] No, no, no. Easy, easy, you guys. Don't cry."
Brent,"Okay, Steve. If me and you put our two brilliant minds together, we will get out of here."
Steve,Steve?
Earl," Brent, do you ever get the feeling that maybe Steve Lockwood is just a monkey?"
Brent," [covers Steve's ears] Why would you say that about him, Earl? Why would you ever say that?!"
Barb, Of course he's just a monkey. How stupid are you people? No one should ever put any trust in a monkey.
Manny, Chester thinks you're a monkey.
Barb," Well, I'm an ape. Chester knows that."
Sam, But he calls you a monkey.
Brent, Ohh…!
Manny," It is true, he does."
Barb, He's just joking around. (Right? I mean…) Chester's my best friend. (Is he?)
Sam, If Chester was really your friend… would he still call you a monkey?
Marshmallow,N-woo! N-woo! 
Tim,Flint. 
Flint,Dad.
Tim,"What's happening, son? You look terrible. What's with all of them?"
Flint,They saved my life. I let Chester steal the machine and now he's starting Operation Slice and Dice.
Tim,"Come on, son. You're really not making any sense."
Flint,"Look, Chester's gonna wipe out all the foodimals. My friends tried to tell me they were good, but I didn't listen. Everything I touch just gets ruined. "
Barry,N-woo! 
Flint,Barry? Barry. I'm so sorry I misjudged you. I should have listened to Sam. 
Barry,Saspa. Sam. 
Flint,What is it? What are you trying to say? 
Barry,"Saspa, Saspa. Saspa! "
Tim, Sassy pants. 
Flint,Dad. 
Barry,"Saspa, Saspa! "
Flint,Sam and the gang?  It looks like a Sentinel of Safety. 
Tim,Aha! Sassy pants. 
Flint,"Sassy pants? No, Dad. He's saying Sentinels captured Sam and the gang. And they're being held in the factory?"
Tim,We gotta get them out of there. 
Flint,But how? There's just two of us. 
Tim,"Hey, what's with all the ""N-woos""? Why do they have my TV? "
Flint,Water goes in the top and food comes out the bottom. N-woo! N-woo! 
Tim,"What's it, broken or something? What's it doing?"
Barry, [flashback] N-woo! 
Flint," [flashback]Here, you take it, you take it. N-woo."
Flint, It's saying that I'm N-woo. 
Tim,"Look, Flint, they came here to help. We all did. It's time to let us. "
Flint,"Okay, I don't know if you can understand me. I know you think I'm N-woo. But the truth is I'm no N-woo, I'm just a man. A man who's made a lot of mistakes in the last couple of days. And now my friends are in a lot of trouble, thanks to me. Someone once told me that I didn't need friends. That I could accomplish more by myself. I know now more than ever that he was wrong. We need all the friends we can get. And I need your help. All of you. Fruits, vegetables and meat! I need you to help me to get into that factory, save our friends and get our home back! Okay, now I just gotta figure out how to get in there."
Tim,"With the right rod and tackle, I could cast you up into that unfinished part of the factory. Should be a piece of cake. "
Flint,"Dad, let's go fishing."
Tim,"Wildebeets! Meatballrus! Go, go, go! Watermelophant, do your thing!"
Flint,Spray-On Shoes. Hair Un-Balder. Grocery Deliverator. Helmet.
Tim,Got it.
Flint,"Ready when you are, Dad! "
Tim,"Ready, skipper, my boy. It's too heavy! Whoa! Here comes the cavalry."
Flint,No way! Subs!
Flint and Barry, Subwhales!
Tim,"Prepare to release lure. Hit it, Sweet.  Catch the big one, buddy.  "
Flint,Yes!  
Sentinel,Uhh... We have a problem. 
Barry,"N-woo, in here."
Flint,What's going on? Sam's backpack. They were here! AHHH! Good cheespider?
Barry,Saspa?
Flint,"Got it, Barry. Thanks, cheespider."
Flint,"Barry, use the Grocery Deliverator to save your friends. I'll go save mine."
Tim, There's a leek in my boat. Flint!
Barry,"Go, go, go!"
Sentinel,"Hey, freeze!"
Barry,Uh-oh.
Sentinel,Food fight!
Sentinel,Run! I'm all cheesed up. Retreat! Retreat!

Chester V,Lockwood? You're still alive?
Flint,That's right. Hands up. Give me back my friends.
Chester V,Of course! I have them right here.
Sam,"Hey, Flint."
Flint," Sam! Guys! Chester, let them go!"
Chester V," Don't worry, Lockwood, I'll let them go. Right into my super-sized Food Bar machine!"
All,Food Bars?
Flint,Food Bars? You're going to turn them into Food Bars?
Chester V,"Yes, Food Bars. The lifeblood of my company. I learned your FLDSMDFR food is far more delicious than ""food"" food. So using your foodimals as ingredients would make my products super-delicious! I had to have your invention. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it. Until you helped me."
Flint,FLDSMDFR!
Machine voice,Watermelon!
Sam,You're a monster! Those are living creatures.
Chester V,"Yes, that's the problem. Food with legs is much harder to catch. They hide, they fight back, they want to live. Ugh. But now that I control your FLDSMDFR, I can pave your island and work in complete secrecy. Live Corp will remain the coolest, hippest company in the world with a new Food Bar version 8.0!"
Flint,I never should have believed in you.
Chester V,"Yes, that was quite foolish. Now if you want your friends back, I suggest you drop your cans."
Sam,"Don't do it, Flint! Save the island!"
Flint, But you are my island.
Chester V," Ew. Okay, first, shut up. Then drop the cans or I drop your friends. "
Flint,"  Okay, okay. There. "
Chester V,"Oh, no, Flint. This is embarrassing. I changed my mind. Please understand I can't leave any witnesses. Barb, grind them."
Barb," But, sir, I didn't think we were going to-- "
Chester V,"This is why I work alone. Monkey! You are dismissed. And now, without further ado."
Sam," Flint, hurry!  "
Chester V, Why won't this go faster? 
Flint,Give me that controller! 
Chester V," Sure, come and get it. "
Holograms,But which one of us has it? Is it me? Or me?
Sam,"Earl, can't you break us out of here?"
Earl,Yellow police tape! The one thing I can't break.
Flint,"Forkenknifenspooninator! Sam, guys, listen. Invisible coffee table! I'm sorry I was such an idiot."
Sam,"Flint, that's true, but now may not be the time!"
Flint,Please let me finish. I took you all for granted. I should have listened to you.
Sam,"Okay, go on. But hurry!"
Flint,The truth is I need each and every one of you guys. You're more than my friends. You're my family. Oh!
Chester V, How sweet. Note to self: Put that on their tombstones.
Holograms," Good one, Chester!"
Chester V," Don't you see, young Lockwood? These friends... ...are the reason you keep losing."
Flint,"Well, it's better than ending up alone like you."
Chester V," Ha, ha, I'm not alone! I've got holograms!"
Sam, Flint! Why don't you throw him a party?
Holograms, We love parties.
Flint,Party? Party!
Chester V," Party's over, Lockwood."
Flint,No! Not yet. I think it's time to celebrate!
Steve,Celebrate!
Flint,"Yes! Thanks, lab partner."

Manny,Tacodile supreme.
Flint,"It's over, Chester."
Steve,Mustache!
Flint,Now hand over the FLDSMDFR.
Chester V, No! Never!
Flint,"Chester, there's nowhere to go!"
Chester V,"That's what you think. Save me, monkey!"
Barb, I'M AN APE!
Chester V,Bad monkey! Give that back! Bad monk--! Whooaa!
Chester V," My holograms, save me! [his holograms form into a net to save him from the Food Bar machine] You see, Flint? With my holograms… [as soon as his holograms touch him, however, they disappear] Oh, fudge. (I forgot.) [ducks into his vest which bounces off the Food Bar machine like a pinball until he's finally launched towards the exit] I saved myself! [just before he could go through the exit, however, the Cheese Spider grabs him with his cheese tongue and eats him... alive, killing him]"
Manny,That will leave a bad taste in your mouth. 
Barb,Ahem..Uh... I believe this belongs to you.
Flint,"Here you go, pal. Gosh, I hope this works."
Machine Voice, Pickle. Cheeseburger. Leek. Strawberry. Lemon. Banana.
Flint,"Yes! Ha, ha!"

Flint,"Thanks, Dad. But there's one last thing I need to do."
Tim,"Okay, now, son. Now, once you put it on like that, all you have to do is cast it."
Flint,So like this? Ehh.
Tim,"No, no, no. Here, let me show you how. See, it's all in the wrist. Like this. Whoo! Catch the big one, boy."
Flint,Am I fishing?
Tim,Yup.
Flint,I'm fishing!
Tim,"Whoa, whoa! You've got a live one. Now reel him in, Flint. That's it. Steady, steady. Oh. He's a fighter!"
Flint,"Ah! I got one! I got one, Dad! Okay. Can we do this again? Like all the time?"
Tim,"You betcha, skipper."
Flint,"Sam, guys, I caught my first fish!"

Until the day the Baby Brent Sardine Cannery closed for good, right after everyone in the world realized that sardines are super gross. Soon, all of us were stuck eating the sardines that no one else wanted. Poached, fried, boiled, dried, candied, and juiced. Life became gray and flavorless. But when all seemed lost, I stared at defeat...and found hope."

Miguel,"</b> Sometimes, I think I'm cursed. Because of something that happened before I was even born."
Miguel,"</b> See, a long time ago, there was this family. The papa, he was a musician. He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings. But he also had a dream. To play for the world. And one day, he left with his guitar and never returned. And the mama... She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician. After banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for her daughter. She rolled up her sleeves and sh learned to make shoes. She could have made candy, or fireworks, or sparkly underwear for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes. Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. Music had torn her family apart. But shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great-great grandmother, Mama Imelda. She died way before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on <i>Dia de los Muertos,</i> the Day of the Dead. And her little girl, she's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco. "
Miguel,"</b> Hola, Mama Coco."
Mama Coco,"</b> How are you, Julio?"
Miguel,"</b> Actually, my name is Miguel. <i>(he gives Mama Coco a piece of orange and he eats the other one himself.)</i> Mama Coco has trouble remembering things, but it's good to talk to her anyway. So... I tell her pretty much about everything."
Miguel,"</b> I used to run like this. <i>(then he shows her how faster he runs)</i> But I run like this, and just way faster."
Miguel,</b> And the winner is... Luchadora Coco.

MISS PIGGY,"</b> <i>Joex Noel</i>, Kermie! I just wanted to tell you I have an itsy bit of Christmas shopping to do before I come out to the farmhouse."
KERMIT,"</b> But, Piggy, tonight's Christmas Eve."
MISS PIGGY,"</b> Not never you fear, dear. I shall be there soon. Ta-ta!"
MISS PIGGY,"</b> Oh! Green fuzzy flipper slippers! Oh, divine! Have them gift-wrapped. (laughs)"
FOZZIE,"</b> Kermit, now can I tell you about my new act?"
KERMIT,</b> I'm all ears.
KERMIT,</b> Now what can that be?
FOZZIE,"</b> What does he mean, he's all ears? Frogs don't even have ears."
DOC,</b> This is my dog Sprocket. He is not a Christmas turkey!
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (speaking foreign language)
DOC,"</b> I don't care if the turkey says the dog is a turkey. The dog is not a turkey. The turkey's the turkey, you turkey!"
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (speaking foreign language)
DOC,"</b> Come on, Sprocket!"
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (speaking foreign language) Goofy-woofy!
TURKEY,</b> This is starting to be fun. (laughs)
TURKEY,"</b> Whoa, speaking of fun... Hey, mama, how you doin'?"
SCOOTER,</b> Look what I have! It's home movies! I found this old film in the closet. It's the very first Christmas the Muppets ever spent together!
KERMIT,</b> Great! I haven't seen that film in years. Turn off the lights and roll the film!
MUPPET BABIES, You'd better watch out
JANICE," Oh, Animal."
SCOOTER,"</b> Yep, some things never change."
DOC,"</b> Oh, that was fun. Even weirdos are cute when they're babies."
GONZO,</b> I knew you'd learn to love us!
DOC,</b> I didn't say that.
GONZO,</b> (chuckles awkwardly)
CAMILLA,</b> (clucking offscreen)
GONZO,</b> What's that?
TURKEY,"</b> I tell you, Chicken Little, you're my kind of poultry."
GONZO,"</b> Camilla, what's going on here?"
TURKEY,"</b> You got some drumsticks there, my fine-feathered mama."
GONZO,</b> B-But Camilla's <i>my</i> girlfriend.
TURKEY,</b> You gotta be kiddin'. You're not even a bird!
GONZO,"</b> Well, nobody's perfect."
TURKEY,"</b> Come on, Henny Penny, let's me and you got out to the farmyard for a little friendly scratching and squawking."
GONZO,"</b> All right, cut! That does it. Let me at him. I'm gonna rip off his waddle!"
TURKEY,</b> You and what other nerds?
GONZO,"</b> Put up your wings, turkey toes!"
TURKEY,"</b> Why, you're pulling my leg, hose nose!"
GONZO,"</b> I'll be pulling your...your wishbone, cranberry breath!"
TURKEY,"</b> Oh, yeah?"
GONZO,</b> Yeah.
TURKEY,"</b> Oh, yeah?!"
GONZO,</b> Yeah--
KERMIT,</b> Hark! What do I hear?
GONZO,</b> You hear me about to make some turkey hash!
KERMIT,"</b> No, listen! Methinks me hears carolers!"

FOZZIE,</b> Check.

FOZZIE,</b> What about Oscar?
OSCAR,</b> I'll be nicely miserable in my trash can here.

ERNIE,"</b> Don't worry, Bert. We're getting to him. ''With a little old driver so lively and quick, I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.''"
HEADED MONSTER,</b> Hello!
SAM,</b> Is nothing sacred? (groan)
BERT,"</b> Now wait a minute! Now, who let the two-headed monster be Santa Claus?"
ERNIE,"</b> But he said he'd never been in a play before. I mean, they said it. Both of him said it."
BERT,"</b> Please go to the big finish, will you? Please..."
ERNIE,</b> ''But I heard him exclaim ere he drove out of sight...''
HEADED MONSTER,</b> Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!
SESAME STREET MUPPETS,</b> Merry Christmas to all and to all a good night!

DOC,"</b> Sorry to break up your fun in here, but have you folks seen the weather? There's a real storm out there."
MA BEAR,"</b> Oh, Lordy. I haven't seen a sky like that since the blizzard of '41. I tell you, Mr. Lizard, it's a good thing all your friends are safe and warm inside the farmhouse."
KERMIT,"</b> Yeah, but... All my friends are not safe and warm."
DOC,</b> Sorry to hear that. It's cold enough out there to freeze your Winnebago.
MISS PIGGY,"</b> Hello, Kermie? I've finished my shopping. Unfortunately, Jerome got the limo stuck in the snowbank... So I'll just have to catch a taxi to the farmhouse."
KERMIT,"</b> Listen, Piggy, there's a terrible storm outside, and I really think it's too dangerous to travel. So why don't you wait for the storm to end before you join us?"
MISS PIGGY,</b> Nonsense. And miss Christmas eve with <i>vous</i>? It's just a little bit of snow. See you soon! Bye-bye!
MISS PIGGY,"</b> (grunts) Yo, taxi!"
KERMIT,</b> I'm sure Miss Piggy will be all right. (gulp)
FOZZIE,"</b> Kermit, you look worried. I know exactly what you need."
FOZZIE,</b> Comedy.
KERMIT,</b> What?
FOZZIE,"</b> Yeah, come on. Now's the time for you to meet my new partner."
KERMIT,</b> Who's your new partner?
FOZZIE,</b> A snowman.
KERMIT,</b> The heck you say.
FOZZIE,</b> Yeah. Come outside. We'll do our act for you.
KERMIT,"</b> Outside? Fozzie, it's too cold to go outside."
FOZZIE,</b> It's not cold.
KERMIT,</b> It is cold!
FOZZIE,</b> It's not cold!
SNOWMAN,</b> (shiver) Can I come in and warm up?
FOZZIE,"</b> Okay, so it's cold."
KERMIT,</b> (stammers) I'm Kermit the Frog. You must be Fozzie's new partner.
SNOWMAN,</b> I'll say! We're terrific!
FOZZIE,"</b> Yeah, yeah, come on. You are coming in a snowman, but you are going out a star."
FOZZIE,"</b> Hey, hey, everybody, would you like to see our new act?"
STATLER,</b> We'd love to see your act!
WALDORF,"</b> In fact, we'd hate to miss your act!"
STATLER,"</b> In fact, we'd love to hate your act!"
 WALDORF,</b> (laughing)
FOZZIE,</b> Statler? Waldorf? W-Where'd you guys come from?
MA BEAR,"</b> They're friends of mine, Fozzie. They come visit me every Christmas."
FOZZIE,</b> (stammers) My own mother is friends with you guys?
STATLER,</b> These two comics are made for each other.
WALDORF,</b> Hm.
STATLER,"</b> The snowman is ice cold, and the bear's not so hot!"
 WALDORF,</b> (laughing)
FOZZIE,"</b> Oh, please..."
WALDORF,"</b> After all, there's no business like snow business!"
 WALDORF,</b> (laughing)
FOZZIE,"</b> Come on, ignore them. Do the straight line. Here we go."
SNOWMAN,"</b> Okay. Hey, Fozzie!"
FOZZIE,"</b> Yes, Mr. Snowman?"
SNOWMAN,</b> Did you hear about the church that burned down?
 WALDORF,</b> Holy smoke! (laugh)
FOZZIE,</b> (whispering) That was our best joke.
SNOWMAN,"</b> That does it, Fozzie. Forget the act. I'm starting to melt. It's too hot in here."
STATLER,"</b> Well, you know what they say."
WALDORF,"</b> If you can't stand the heat, get out of the farmhouse!"
 WALDORF,</b> (laughing)
FOZZIE,"</b> (sigh) Come on, you'll be okay on the back porch."
DOC,"</b> Boy, that storm is really getting worse."
SPROCKET,</b> (moans)
KERMIT,"</b> Yeah, I hope Miss Piggy is okay."
DOC,</b> There is one worried frog.
COUNT,</b> That's one! One worried frog!
ROBIN,</b> He's not the only one.
COUNT,</b> That's two! Two worried frogs!
SPROCKET,</b> (quizzical moan)
DOC,"</b> Search me. More small talk, I think. Hey, I'd better go out and get some firewood."
SPROCKET,</b> (quizzical moan)
BIG BIRD,"</b> Hi, there!"
BIG BIRD,"</b> Did you wish to talk to me about something, Mr. Cook, sir?"
BIG BIRD,"</b> Gee, nice kitchen."
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> Oof!
BIG BIRD,"</b> Hey, are you gonna have cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes?"
BIG BIRD,"</b> Oh, boy."
BIG BIRD,</b> I just wanna... I just wanna to hear about the whole meal.
BIG BIRD,"</b> But first, I want to give this little present to you."
BIG BIRD,</b> It's chocolate-covered birdseed. I made it myself.
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (speaking foreign language)
BIG BIRD,"</b> I wanted to give it to you because, well... I know that you're from Sweden, and it must be hard for you because...you're away from your family and loved ones during the holidays."
BIG BIRD,"</b> At Christmas, there are places and people and things that become...very, very special."
BIG BIRD,"</b> Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose..."
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (singing in a foreign language)
BIG BIRD,</b> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (singing in a foreign language)
BIG BIRD,"</b> Though it's been said many times, many ways... Merry Christmas..."
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (singing in a foreign language)
 SWEDISH CHEF,</b> Merry Christmas... To you...
BIG BIRD,"</b> Now then, Mr. Cook, tell me... Exactly what are you going to fix for Christmas dinner?"
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> (speaking foreign language)
BIG BIRD,</b> Shredded wheat and cranberry sauce? My absolute favorite!
SWEDISH CHEF,</b> Yah.
BEAUREGARD,</b> Going to be lots of snow for me to shovel tomorrow.
KERMIT,</b> It's getting worse and worse out there.
BEAUREGARD,</b> Aren't you glad you're in here all warm and toasty?
KERMIT,</b> I just wish Miss Piggy were.
BEAUREGARD,</b> Hm.
MISS PIGGY,"</b> Okay! When I yell, ''Three,'' gun it! One! Two! Three!"
DOC,"</b> You're really worried about your friend, aren't you, Kermit?"
KERMIT,"</b> Hmm? Oh, well, yeah, a little."
DOC,</b> I'll tell you what. I'll go out looking for her.
KERMIT,</b> Really? But... But you've never even met Miss Piggy.
DOC,</b> We never met any of you until a little while ago. And now we're friends.
KERMIT, Oh.
KERMIT,"</b> Well, to begin with, uh... She's a pig."
DOC,"</b> Well, up to a short while ago, I would have thought that strange. I'll give it a try."
KERMIT,"</b> Gee, thanks, Doc!"
SNOWMAN,</b> You'll be sorry! It's cold enough to freeze your Winnebago!
KERMIT,</b> What a sweet guy.
ROBIN,</b> Uncle Kermit!
KERMIT,</b> Robin? Where are you?
ROBIN,</b> In the cellar.
KERMIT,</b> What are you doing down there?
ROBIN,</b> I made a discovery.
KERMIT,"</b> Oh, yeah? Uh, what are-- What are you talking about?"
ROBIN,</b> Remember telling me about Fraggle holes?
KERMIT,"</b> Uh, so?"
ROBIN,"</b> And how if I ever found one, we could go into Fraggle Rock and maybe meet some Fraggles?"
KERMIT,</b> So?
ROBIN,</b> Is that one?
KERMIT,"</b> Ooh! Look at that. Well, it certainly looks like one. You never know where you're going to find these things."
ROBIN,"</b> Can we go in, Uncle Kermit?"
KERMIT,"</b> Well, maybe just a little ways. See if we can meet anyone."
KERMIT,"</b> Watch your step, Robin."
ROBIN,"</b> Gee, it's kind of scary."
KERMIT,</b> These are beautiful caves. Ooh...
ROBIN,"</b> Hey, Uncle Kermit, wait up."
ROBIN,</b> Do you think this is really Fraggle Rock?
KERMIT,"</b> Wellm I dunno, but if I were a Fraggle, I think this is the kind of place I'd hang out."
KERMIT,</b> Wait a second. I thought I heard something.
KERMIT,"</b> Guess not. Well, anyhow..."
RED, 
GOBO," Hi, yourself!"
WEMBLEY,</b> I'll say.
RED,</b> But you're not.
WEMBLEY,</b> I'll say.
KERMIT,"</b> No, I'm Kermit. This is Robin. We're frogs."
MOKEY,</b> They're frogs.
WEMBLEY,</b> I'll say.
BOOBER,</b> Don't touch them! Frogs are probably noted germ carriers.
KERMIT,"</b> Actually, we just came down here to wish you all a merry Christmas."
BOOBER,</b> Thank you.

WEMBLEY,</b> Um... What's Christmas?
ROBIN,</b> Don't you have Christmas?

MOKEY,"</b> Yes, we do. As-as a matter of fact, we're celebrating it right now."
MOKEY,"</b> You see, we give each other little presents. I'm giving Boober this nice yellow pebble."
RED,</b> And I gave Mokey that pebble last year.
WEMBLEY,</b> And I gave it to Red the year before that!

MISS PIGGY,"</b> I heard her, I heard her! Well, this is the mink? My mink?"
KERMIT,</b> Of course.
MAURINE,"</b> Oh, Miss Piggy, I've seen everything you've done. I'm your biggest fan. I worship the ground you walk on."
MISS PIGGY,</b> (laughs) What a wonderful present!
ROBIN,"</b> Speaking of presents, Grover... I'd like you to have this Fraggle pebble."

CRUELLA," Oh, no. We’re starting here? Okay."
CRUELLA, But I wasn’t for everyone.
CRUELLA, Including my mother.
CRUELLA," It wasn’t her I was challenging, it was the world."
CRUELLA, How does the saying go?
BOY, Nice jacket.
CRUELLA, “Ignore them”?
STUDENTS, (CHANTING) Fight! Fight! Fight!
CRUELLA, That didn’t sit well with some people.
CRUELLA," Okay, that didn’t sit well with a lot of people."
CRUELLA, But I found friends in unlikely places.
ESTELLA, Hello.
CRUELLA, And not this guy.
CRUELLA, Being a genius is one thing.
CRUELLA, I meant it when I said it.
CRUELLA, I did try to lay low.
WOMAN, I am. I’m sure it’ll be quite extravagant.
JOHN, Go to the east garden. I’ll see what I can do.
CRUELLA," I figured while Mum was busy seeing her mysterious friend, I’d just take a little peek."
CRUELLA, I could’ve blamed Buddy for what happened next.
CRUELLA," But the truth is, I did escalate things."
SERVER," Oh, crumbs!"
CATHERINE, She’s my life.
CRUELLA, There are no words.
BARONESS, There’s been the most dreadful accident.
CRUELLA, It was my fault.
BARONESS, Police Commissioner Weston!
CRUELLA, I had killed my mother.
CRUELLA, And in that moment…
COMMISSIONER, Search the grounds!
CRUELLA, …the best I could think to do was run.
BOY," Sir, please could you spare some change?"
CRUELLA, …and Jasper.
CRUELLA, Which was also annoying.
CRUELLA, I skipped over the part where I killed her.
CRUELLA, He was right. I was a fugitive.
CRUELLA," Granted, being a thief is not exactly a mother’s dream, but she was gone."
CRUELLA, We were like a family.
CRUELLA," Really, really, really good."
MAN, Oi! Thieves!
JASPER," Two, three!"
JASPER AND HORACE, (SINGING) Happy birthday to you!
HORACE, “Polo thing.”
CRUELLA, (SIGHS) Liberty of London.
WOMAN, On Tuesday?
JASPER, Horace.
GERALD," Sorry, Baroness…"
BARONESS, You’re a fool.
CRUELLA, It’s funny how those happy accidents can change the whole direction of your life.
BARONESS, There’s something about it that irritates me and I always trust my instincts.
ROGER," Yes, sorry. It’s in."
BARONESS, Come along.
CRUELLA," My mother hadn’t failed dismally, I had."
ESTELLA, We need to know their security setup.
ESTELLA, Where the cameras are.
ESTELLA," Then, all we need to do is disable the security system, bypass the cameras, open the safe, steal the necklace during the biggest party of the season."
HORACE," Right, let’s do it."
ANITA, Baroness.
BARONESS," No one is interested in what you write, my dear."
GUESTS, To the Baroness!
JASPER," (ON WALKIE-TALKIE) All right, we’re good."
HORACE, There’s a car!
JASPER, What’s going on?
HORACE," Oh, blimey."
CRUELLA, They say there are five stages of grief.
JASPER, But that’s not how we usually…
MAN, Oi!
HORACE, I’m not the enemy! Stop that!
CRUELLA," Well, you have to walk them, feed them."
CRUELLA, Fashion fact.
CRUELLA," I was going to take the things she loved most… her business, her status…"
CRUELLA, …her confidence.
REPORTER, Baroness! Over here!
CRUELLA," Roger always blamed me for getting him fired, but the real reason Roger was fired is because…"
JASPER, Getting anything?
JASPER, It’s risky.
JASPER, The dogs?
HORACE," Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you…"
POLICEMAN, Oi! Get out! Come on!
CRUELLA, For what?
GUARD," Come on, you. Come on."
JOHN, Mmm-hmm.
POSTMAN, Oi!
COMMISSIONER," The boys are locked up, but we have a problem."
BARONESS, I don’t pay you for problems.
HORACE," Yeah, exactly."
JASPER," Yeah, me too."
CRUELLA, Jasper!
WOMAN, For me?
HORACE," When I fixed it, I noticed a name."
CONSTABLE, Who is this?
JASPER," (OVER RADIO) All teams, Baroness requires everybody in the library now."
ALL, To Cruella!
CRUELLA, So I told you I died.
CRUELLA, Cruella de Vil.
CRUELLA," The good thing about evil people is you can always trust them to do something, well, evil."
CRUELLA, And I call that a happy ending.
ROGER," Hello, Pongo."
ROGER, (SINGING) Cruella de Vil
TED," Reason 12, I organised"
TINA," Ladies and gentlemen,"
PICCADILLY," Come out, Curious George."

Defender Strange,"</b> I know. But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse, your sacrifice is worth more than your life."
Doctor Nicodemus West,</b> Doctor Strange.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Doctor West.
Doctor Nicodemus West,</b> Haven't seen you in a while.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I was a little preoccupied being dust in the air for five years.
Doctor Nicodemus West,</b> So were a lot of us. While I was gone... thank you for asking... I lost both my cats. And my brother.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I'm very sorry.
Doctor Nicodemus West,"</b> Thank you. I, uh... I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering... Did it have to happen that way? Was there any other path?"
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> No. But I made the only play we had.
Doctor Nicodomus West,"</b> Of course, you do. The best surgeon and the best superhero. But you still didn't get the girl."
Doctor Christine Palmer,"</b> Glass of red, please? [to the bar tender.]"
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Allow me, Miss."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> A little too on the nose?
Doctor Christine Palmer,"</b> What, for you, at my wedding? Nah. It was perfect."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Congratulations.
Doctor Christine Palmer,"</b> Thank you. There's Charlie. I have to introduce you because he's kind of... It's embarrassing, but he's a big fan."
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> So... Hey, uh, Christine... umm... I should have... I wish it had been different. I never stopped caring about us, but I had to make sacrifices. To protect you. I'm sorry."
Doctor Christine Palmer,</b> It was never gonna work out between us.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Why not?
Doctor Christine Palmer,"</b> Because Stephen... You have to be the one holding the knife. And I always respected you for it, but I couldn't love you for it."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> How long have you had that one in the barrel?
Doctor Christine Palmer,</b> Long time.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Yeah. I bet. Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy."
Doctor Christine Palmer,"</b> I am. I really, really am."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Good.
Doctor Christine Palmer,</b> Are you?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I'm happy.
Doctor Christine Palmer,</b> Good. You deserve it.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Thank you.
America,</b> Look out!
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Do I know you?
Wong,</b> Help! You're welcome. Do you know it's ancient custom to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Yeah. I'm aware of the customs. Hold it. Hold it.
Charlie,</b> Woah! That's incredible.
Doctor Christine Palmer,</b> Yeah.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Oh, god!"
Wong,</b> Who's this?
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question. (grabbing her wrist) Hey, kid. What did that creature want with you?"
Wong,</b> Where are your parents?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Take her back to the Sanct... She took my slingy.  
Wong,</b>She took your slingy. 
America,</b> That wasn't a dream. It was another universe. 
America,</b> How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse?
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> We have experience with the Multiverse. Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man..."
America,</b> With what Man?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.
Wong,</b> Hence the name.
America,</b> Gross. Does he look like a spider?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> No. More like a man.
Wong,"</b> Climbs walls, shoot webs."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Yeah. Bingo.
America,</b> Out his butt?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> No. Maybe. I don't know.
Wong,</b> Ew.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Honestly, I hope not."
America,</b> Super weird.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> You're gonna get a stomachache.
America,</b> I'm from another universe. How do you know my stomach works the same as yours?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I don't. I don't even know if you're from another universe. Which is why I'm still sitting here waiting for you to enlighten us.
America,"</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> Frankly, of the two Doctor Stranges that I've met, you are not my favorite."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Which means?
America,</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> He can't speak Spanish?
Wong,</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> I don't even know if he speaks his own language.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Look, I left a very nice wedding to save a smartness kid from getting eaten by an octopus. Tell me--"
Wong,</b> Whose wedding?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Christine's.
Wong,</b> You went?
America Chavez,</b> Holy shit. You married Christine?
by,</b> Do you mind?
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Yes, I do. No, I didn't. Yes. You need to explain to me what's going on. Why was that octopus trying to eat you?"
America Chavez,</b> That thing was trying to kidnap me. It's like a henchman who works for a demon. All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> What power?
America Chavez,</b> I can travel the Multiverse.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> What?
Wong,</b> You can physically move from one universe to another?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> How?
America Chavez," That's the problem. I don't know how. I can't control it. Only happens when I'm really, really afraid."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Okay. Did the other me know how to defeat this demon?
America Chavez," Well, you just knew this magical book of pure good, that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> The Book of Vishanti? It's not real. It's a fairy tale that doesn't exist.
Wong," Actually, it does. I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Unbelievable.
America Chavez, You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> No, I am not the Sorcerer Supreme."
America, Other you was Sorcerer Supreme in his universe.
Wong," Although it does exist, the Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable."
America," It is, except... we reached it. Then the demon caught up with us. I thought you'd protect me, but... You didn't."
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> That was the fight in my dream.
America, That wasn't a dream.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Prove it. It wasn't a dream. That means... Dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.
America, That was his theory.
Wong, So that recurring nightmare where I'm running naked from a clown...
America Chavez," Somewhere out there, it's real."
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Somewhere out there, I had a ponytail."
Wong, There could be more creatures coming for her.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> That power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid. Imagine if a real threat acquired it.
Wong," It occurs to me, young one, we don't know your name."
America Chavez, America Chavez.
Wong," Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj? You'll be safe there."
America Chavez, How do I know you won't betray me like he did?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.
Wong, What do we do with him? That's gotta violate an ordinance.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I've buried worse.
Wong," The creature that killed him, did... did it have the same markings as the octopus?"
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Runes.
Wong, This isn't sorcery.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> It's witchcraft.
Wong, Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I think I might.
Billy and Tommy, Chocolate!
Billy and Tommy, But we can't wait.
Tommy," Mom, come on. I'm too old for that."
Billy," You can tuck me in, Mom."
Tommy," Mom, I changed my mind. You can come tuck me in if you want."
Strange," Apples, right?"
Wanda, Eventually.
Strange, Smells...
Wanda, Sweet. 
Strange, So I can see.
Wanda," Well, I knew sooner or later you'd... show up, wanting to discuss what happened at WestView. I made mistakes, and people were hurt."
Strange, But you put things right in the end and that was never in doubt. I'm not here to talk about WestView.
Wanda, Then what are you here for?
Strange, We need your help.
Wanda, With what?
Strange, What do you know about the Multiverse?
Wanda," The Multiverse. Vis had his theories. He believed it was real. And, dangerous."
Strange," Well, he was right about both. We found a girl who can somehow travel across it but she's being pursued."
Wanda, Pursued by who?
Strange," Some kind of demon. One that covets her power for itself. Now we've taken her to Kamar-Taj, and... We've got our defenses, but... We could use an Avenger."
Wanda, There are other Avengers.
Strange," Yeah, but given a choice between the Archer with a mohawk, and several bug-themed crimefighters, or... One of the most powerful magic wielders on the planet, it's an easy call. Come to Kamar-Taj. It'll get you back on a lunch box."
Wanda, What if you brought America here?
Strange, Here?
Wanda," Yeah. I know what it's like. To be on your own, hunted for abilities you never wanted. I can protect her. "
Wanda," You never told me her name, did you?"
Strange," No. No, I didn't."
Wanda," You know, the Hex was the easy part. The lying, not so much."
Strange, The Darkhold.
Wanda, You've heard of the Darkhold?
Strange, I know it's the Book of the Damned. And that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches. I wonder what it's done to you.
Wanda, The Darkhold only showed me the truth. Everything I lost... can be mine again.
Strange, What do you want with America? What do you want with the Multiverse?
Wanda," I'm going to leave this reality, and go to one where I can be with my children."
Strange," Wanda, your children aren't real. You created them using magic."
Wanda," That's what every mother does. If you knew... there was a universe, where you were happy, wouldn't you wanna go there?"
Strange, I am happy.
Wanda, I know better than most what self-deception looks like.
Strange," What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law. If you take that child's power, she won't survive."
Wanda," I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen. But she's not a child. She's a supernatural being. Such raw power could wreak havoc on this, and other worlds. Her sacrifice would be for the greater good."
Strange, Well you can kiss the lunchbox goodbye because that's the kind of justification our enemies use.
Wanda, Is it the one you use? When you gave Thanos the Time Stone?
Strange," That was war, and I did what I had to do."
Wanda, You break the rules and become a hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesn't seem fair.
Strange, What happens now?
Wanda," Return to Kamar-Taj, and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown. Peacefully. After that... You'll never see me again."
Strange, And if we don't?
Wanda, Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her. It will be the Scarlet Witch.
Wong, Scarlet Witch.
Wong," Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic. She can rewrite reality as she chooses, and is prophesized to either rule, or annihilate the cosmos."
Strange, She took over a whole town using her mind. If she gets America's power... she could enslave the entire Multiverse.
America," So the person you went to ask for help, and told exactly where I am, is the person that's trying to kill me?"
Strange, Yeah.
Wong, Suspend teaching at once. And arm the students. Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.
Rintrah, That's the Masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctum.
Master of Hong Kong Sanctum, Honored to face death again by your side.
Wong, The honor is ours.
Master of London Sanctum," Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us, it shall be done."
Wong, It's ancient custom. Choose your words wisely. The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.
Strange," Got it. No pressure, then."
Wanda, All this for a child you met yesterday?
Strange," Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices."
Wanda," I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved... and it meant nothing. Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange. If you give me what I want... I'll send you to a world where you can be with Christine."
Strange, The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.
Wong, Defensive positions. Now!
Strange, Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.
Wanda, You have... no idea just how reasonable I have been.
Strange," Yeah. Book of the Damned, calling yourself a Witch, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid... I don't exactly call that being reasonable."
Wanda," Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy. And in spite of your hypocrisies... and insults, I have begged you to safely get out of my way. You have exhausted my patience. But I do hope you understand... that even now... what's about to happen... This is me, being... reasonable."
Wong, Hold! Hold!
Strange, Nailed it.
Wong, Reinforce the shield!
Strange, She's trying to get in their heads.
Wong, Sorcerers! Fortify your mind!
Wanda, Run...
Wong, The shield is down!
Sara, Fire!
Wong, Yes!
Sara, Take cover!
Wong, Fire at will!
Strange, Fall back! Wong!
Wong, Get out of here!
Strange," You want the girl, you're gonna have to go through me."
Wanda, Fine.
Strange, We gotta get you out of here. Now.
America, Why? What happened?
Wong, Kamar-Taj has fallen.
Strange, Reflections. She's using the reflections.
Wong, Cover them!
Wanda, You gave all those lives just to keep me from my children.
Strange, You took those lives. You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.
Wanda," I'm not a monster, Stephen. I'm a mother."
Strange," Wanda, you have no children. They don't exist."
Wanda," But they do. In every other universe. I know they do. Because I dream of them... Every... night. Of my boys... Of our life together. Every night, the same dream. And every morning... the same... nightmare."
Strange, What if you reach them? What happens to the other you? What happens to their mother?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> You okay?
America Chavez,</b> You saved me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> I hope so.
America Chavez,</b> Surprised you didn't puke.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> That's not my first weird trip, kid. So. This is New York in the Multiver..."
America Chavez,</b> There it is.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Crap. [The Cloak of Levitation wipes Strange's mouth.] Cut it out.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Yeah. You got pretty dinged up. [Doctor Strange puts the Cloak back on him.] We'll get you fixed. All right, America. You've gotta open a portal to get us back there right now."
America Chavez,</b> I don't know how.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> You just did it.
America Chavez,</b> Not on purpose.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Wong is back there alone with Wanda and I'm the only hope he has.
America Chavez,</b> I can't control my powers...
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> You must be able to control it somehow. Even I could... [Doctor Strange sees America Chavez shrink back, and realises that he is bringing up bad memories of Defender Strange.] Sorry. Well, what about this universe's version of you? Maybe she can control her powers."
America Chavez,</b> This universe doesn't have a me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> What?
America Chavez,</b> None of them do.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> But how do you know that?
America Chavez,</b> Because I've looked. And... because I never dream.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> It's okay, kid. Even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda."
America Chavez,</b> What about the Book of Vishanti?
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> What about it?
America Chavez,</b> Other you thought it could stop whoever was after me.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Yeah, well, good for other me. He's not here, is he? I don't know where it is. So unless there's another other me..."
America Chavez,</b> We need to go find...
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> Other ""other me""."
Strange, They go on red?
America, Rule number one of Multiversal travel? You don't know anything.
Strange," Right. It's red. So, what's rule number two? America? America?"
America," Rule number two? Find food. Preferrably, pizza. Pizza balls."
Strange, How'd you pay for that?
America," It was free. Food's free in most universes, actually. It's weird you guys have to pay for it."
Pizza Poppa, Hey. You didn't pay for that.
America, Crap. Maybe it's not free here.
Pizza Poppa, Pizza Poppa always gets paid.
Strange," Alright, Pizza Poppa. Relax, she's just a kid..."
Pizza Poppa," Relax yourself there, Doctor Strange. Where did you get this cape from anyway? Oh, that feels authentic."
Strange," It's not a cape, it's a cloak. And I suggest you let go."
Pizza Poppa," You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didn't ya?"
Strange, Strange Museum?
Pizza Poppa," You're a taker. Why don't you take some mustard, huh?!"
Strange, Come on. It's not permanent.
America, Is it gonna stop in a few minutes?
Strange," About three weeks. Those universes we went through, were we paint in one of them?"
America, Yeah. You don't wanna get stuck in there. It's really hard to eat.
Strange, How many universes have you been through?
America," Seventy-two? Seventy-three, counting this one."
Strange, That's... That's a lot.
Automatic Voice," Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you don't forget."
Christine, This is pretty fancy. Sure you didn't have to take out another student loan?
Strange, Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.
Christine," So, I got you a little something... Congratulations."
Strange, What is it?
Christine, Open it and see.
Strange," Christine, this is... This is amazing. Thank you. We don't have time for this."
Automatic Voice," Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you don't forget."
Strange, Where's this?
America," Home. My moms. Yeah, you're right. This is just a waste of time."
Strange," Hey, kid. That was the first time that you opened a portal, right?"
America, It doesn't matter.
Strange, It does matter. You lost your parents.
America, I didn't lose them. I killed them.
Strange," No. No, you did not. Don't even think that."
America," Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I can't control, and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe with no way to escape."
Strange," Listen, if your moms are anything like their daughter... They survived. I'm sure you'll meet them again someday."
America, Not bad.
Strange, Thanks.
America," That woman, in your Memory Lane thing, that was Christine, right?"
Strange," Yes, that was Christine. How do you know her?"
America, From other you.
Strange, Were we together?
America," No, you didn't talk anymore. You blew it."
Strange, Of course.
America, Did you blow it with your Christine?
Strange," Yes, I guess I did."
America, Why?
Strange, Complicated.
America, More complicated than being chased by a witch through the Multiverse?
Strange," Yes, actually. It is."
America," ""Gave his life defeating Thanos?"""
Strange," Yeah, see? We're not all bad."
America, If other you's dead... Who's master of the Sanctum?
Strange," Oh, shit."
America, You know him?
Strange, Yeah. Mordo. He's actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.
America," Oh, great."
Strange, And then he snapped and dedicated his life trying to k*ll me.
America, Oh... Great.
Mordo, I always suspected this day would come.
Strange, You did?
Mordo, Yes. Because you always suspected this day would come. My brother.
Strange, All right.
Mordo," Come, and tell me everything... About your universe."
Strange, We go on red.
Mordo," You're quite formidable too, it seems. A multiversal traveler. But thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety."
Strange," Well, just 'cause we jumped ship, doesn't mean we're safe. Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters to attack America - in other universes."
Mordo, So she has the Darkhold?
Strange," Oh, you know of the Darkhold?"
Mordo," Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too. I got it here in this Sanctum. We would never risk a weapon that dangerous falling into the wrong hands."
Strange, Damn right.
Mordo," If your Darkhold is anything like ours, I'm afraid she can do far worse than just summon monsters, to come after you."
America, What do you mean?
Mordo," There is a spell contained within those pages. Corrosive to the soul. A desecration of reality itself. Dreamwalking. A dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness from their universe into another. Possessing the body of an alternate self. Playing puppeteer, this unholy doppelganger, and pursue their enemies from afar. The possession is not a permanent link between realities, but in the fleeting time they dreamwalk, they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade. So it may not be a demon that you face. It may be, the Scarlet Witch."
America," But, why didn't she do that to begin with?"
Strange, Because that was her being reasonable. What do you know of the Book of Vishanti?
Mordo, The Darkhold's antithesis. It can give a sorcerer whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.
Strange, I need to...
Mordo," I'm sorry, Stephen. But I hope you, of all people, understand... That it is not Wanda Maximoff who threatens our reality. It's the two of you."
Strange, What was in that tea? You son of a b... Sands of Nisanti.
Mordo," I only acted, as you would."
Strange, She is coming. You got me.
Billy and Tommy," Can we have one more ice cream? - Please, please... - Please! - You know who's best?"
Billy and Tommy, 2003 Tigers.
Billy, Mom?
Wanda," Yes, sweetheart?"
Billy, Where are you going?
Wanda, Just... to take out the trash.
Billy," Can we show you something? Mom, hurry. Come on! Come on, it's important."
Tommy, Mom! You'll like it. Come on. Hurry up. It's important.
Billy," Okay, so... Listen to this."
Tommy, I'm gonna start it.
Billy," No, I wanna start it."
Tommy, I wanna start it!
Billy," No, I wanna start!"
Wanda," Why don't you both... start it... whatever... it is, together?"
Tommy, Okay.
Billy, Okay. You ready?
Tommy, Yeah.
Billy and Tommy," Three, two, one, go. We like ice cream like every child should... And if we get some ice cream, we promise to be good!"
Sara, You're alive. Yes. But so many others were lost.
Wong, Set me free. I need to destroy the book.
Sara, No. It cannot be you.
Wong, No!
Billy, Mom! What happened? Are you okay?
Wanda, Billy. Tommy. No. No. I need the Darkhold spells. You are the Sorcerer Supreme. Tell me what you know.
Wong," You'll have to kill me, witch."
Wanda, Not you. Them.
Wong," Wanda, stop. Wanda, please. The Darkhold was a copy!"
Wanda, A copy?
Wong, Legend speaks of a mountain with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls. It's there the Darkhold was transcribed. Mount Wundagore.
Wanda, Wundagore?
Wong, No one has survived the journey.
Wanda, Perhaps we will be the exception.
America, Hey. Hey! This universe sucks!
Strange," Cloak? Hey. Hey, Labcoat. Where the hell are we? Look, I don't know who you are or what you think you're trying to do here, but... These situations don't usually work out well for a nameless scientist, so just... Christine?"
America," Ay, Dios."
Strange, Testing?
Strange," Right. So, I have you to thank for these then."
Strange, Stephen. Is that some kinda cyborg me?
Strange, Oh. You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse. You got someone going around naming realities.
Strange," So, how'd you end up working here? Wherever here is."
Strange, Thank you for going.
Strange," What were we, to each other in this universe?"
Strange," Yeah. That's something we got in common. Christine... You gotta let us out of here. Everyone's in real danger. Look, I know you don't know me..."
Strange, Why not?
Strange," Someone from my universe wants that girl. And she's gonna rip this place apart, atom by atom, until she gets what she wants. So I don't care, if you're from the Avengers, or S.H.I.E.L.D..."
Mordo, We're neither.
Strange," Well, what then? Hydra?"
Mordo," The Illuminati, will see you now."
Strange, The Illumi-whati? Don't let anyone hurt the kid. It's gonna be okay.
Wanda, You couldn't portal us up there?
Wong," My magic can only take us so far. Masters of the Mystic Arts weren't meant to tread upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore. Eons ago... The first demon, Chthon, carved his dark magic into this tomb. These same spells, were later transcribed into the Darkhold. There's no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within."
Wanda, They've been waiting for me. This isn't a tomb. It's a throne.
Mordo," Stephen Strange... You are now called before the Illuminati. I, Baron Karl Mordo, The Sorcerer Supreme, hereby..."
Strange, Karl?
Mordo, Captain Carter. The First Avenger. Blackagar Boltagon. Keeper of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman King.
Strange," Blackagar Boltagar? Hey-the-guy, hey-the-there."
Mordo," Captain Marvel. Defender of the Cosmos. And the smartest man alive, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four."
Reed," Hello, Stephen."
Strange, Fantastic Four? Didn't you guys chart in the sixties?
Maria, I'm sorry. Is this a joke to you?
Strange," Well there's a guy over there with a fork on his head, so, yeah. Little bit."
Carter, Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't engage you in conversation.
Strange, Why? Does he have bad breath?
Carter, This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.
Strange, No. Just more alive.
Maria, For now.
Reed," Stephen, your arrival here confuses and destabilizes reality. The larger the footprint you leave behind, the greater the risk of an incursion."
Strange, Incursion?
Reed," An incusion occurs, when the boundary between two universes erodes, and they collide. Destroying one, or both, entirely."
Carter," Your alternate self created the Illuminati, to make difficult decisions that no one else could. Today, we're here to determine what to do with you, and the child."
Maria," So, before we vote, if you got anything serious to say, now's the time."
Strange," Yeah, I do. It's incursions you're worried about. Do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch?"
Maria," Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to dreamwalk."
Strange," No. No, you cannot, not unless you give me the Book of Vishanti."
Reed," We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear. From our experience, the greatest danger to the Multiverse, it turns out... is Doctor Strange."
Strange, Your Doctor Strange? Earth's Mightiest Hero who died defeating Thanos?
Xavier, We should tell him the truth.
Mordo, Our final member... Professor Charles Xavier.
Strange, What truth?
Xavier, That's not how our Strange died.
Wanda, You're wondering what happens now.
Wong," No. That I had already accepted. But I do wonder... When you can force America to send you to any universe you want, Why take her power for your own? You know it will k*ll her."
Wanda," For Billy and Tommy. To protect them. What if they get sick? In the infinite Multiverse, there's a cure for every illness. A solution to every problem. I won't lose them again."
Wong," Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything."
Wanda, I can. Look at that view. It's carved in stone. I was meant to rule everything. But that's not what I want. I just want my boys.
Wong," At the cost of a child's life! Is there no peace in knowing that, even though you can't be with the ones you love, there are worlds where you are together. Is that not enough?"
Wanda, No.
Xavier," Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos. We were at w*r. While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos, Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone."
Mordo, He turned to the Darkhold. Began dreamwalking. In hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.
Maria, And guess what? It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.
Reed," One day, you called us all together, to profess that you've been dreamwalking. And in your words, ""things have gotten out of hand."" You never told us the details of what had happened. Only that you had inadvertently triggered an incursion. You, our friend, had caused the annihilation of another universe."
Maria, Everyone in that reality died. Everyone.
Xavier," Stephen renounced the Darkhold. He even helped us find the Book of Vishanti. A weapon we did use to k*ll him, to defeat Thanos. Thus, one final threat remained. I shall miss you, my friend."
Strange, I'm ready.
Black Bolt, I'm sorry.
Strange, Did you tell Christine?
Reed, Yes.
Strange, That statue... what about the statue? You built a statue.
Carter," The world needs heroes. We made a difficult choice because we knew what our Strange was capable of. Or perhaps, every Doctor Strange is capable of."
Reed, The building's been breached.
Strange," No shit, genius."
Carter," Status report, all sentries."
Maria, She's headed for the child.
Carter, Watch him. We'll vote on our return.
Xavier," Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber, you must guide America Chavez."
Mordo, What the hell are you saying?
Xavier," Save the girl, and get to the Book of Vishanti."
Strange," What, you have the book here?"
Xavier, Yes. You built a way point.
Mordo, Charles. We cannot trust him.
Xavier," I believe we can. Just 'cause someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they're lost forever. We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are."
Strange, Thank you.
America, It's Wanda.
Automatic Voice, Ultron commander... Ultron command...
America," Hurry up, Doc, she's coming."
Reed," Wanda, stop. You possessed an innocent woman, but you can still do the right thing. Let her go. Please. I have children of my own. I understand your pain."
Wanda, Is their mother still alive?
Reed, Yes.
Wanda, Good. There will be someone left to raise them.
Reed, Wanda... Black Bolt can destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.
Wanda, What mouth?
Strange, Take me to the Book of Vishanti so that we can fight her together.
Mordo, You are in no position to give orders. My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.
Wanda, Haven't you had enough?
Carter, I can do this all day.
Maria, Get the hell out of my universe!
Strange," They're not coming back. And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends. Not that that ever bothered you before. You know, you hated me where I came from. I bet secretly, ""my brother"", you hated me here. You must've been so jealous. Do you know what? I bet you were thrilled when you heard I've been corrupted, hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with."
Mordo," You know nothing, of this universe!"
Strange," I know, that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum, to becoming Sorcerer Supreme, and to joining your little circus of clowns, the Illuminati."
Mordo," I'm ready! To cast my vote. Now.. Die! I think I'm beginning to understand, why your Mordo, didn't like you very much!"
America, Whoa. 
Xavier, Enough! 
Xavier," Wanda Maximoff... Your mind is being held hostage by your alternate self. Grab my hand. If I can pull you from under the rubble, the spell should break. "
Strange, Hey. You all right? You okay? You all right? Yeah. 
America, She fixed him. 
Strange, Thank you. 
Strange, Xavier said I built a waypoint to the Book of Vishanti. Can you take us there? 
Strange," I know what happened. I'm sorry for what he did. But believe me, the Book of Vishanti is the only way. "
America, This Stephen is different. He is. It doesn't matter about all the other Stephens. They're not like him. 
Strange, Smart kid. 
Strange, I won't. 
America," Okay, can we go now? "
Strange, Where does that tunnel go? 
Strange," Go. Go, go, go! "
Wanda, I warned you. 
Strange," Other Wanda, if you're in there, hold your breath. "
America, Did it kill her? 
Strange," No, but it bought us some time. "
Strange," Shit. A chant only specific to me, something only I would know. Come on. "
Strange, Come on... 
Strange, Yeah. Thank you. 
Strange," Open sesame. Come on, kid. You got this. "
America, I got this. 
Strange, Are you all right? 
Strange," All right, Book... Give me what I need. "
America, This isn't what your children would want. 
Wanda, They'll never know. 
America, Maybe not. But you will. 
Strange," Oh, no. Oh, crap! "
Strange, Yeah. Two realities collided. Come on. America doesn't have long. 
Strange," Well, if there's still a Sanctum in this universe, then there might be another, other, ""other me"", and that's our best shoot at getting back to her. Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about incursions. "
Strange, I'll tell him you said that. Hello? 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Stop where you are. How did you get here? 
Strange, By accident. 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Who are you... what are you? 
Strange," I'm just, one of us. "
Sinister Stephen Strange, From the Multiverse? 
Strange, That's right. 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Prove it. 
Strange," We had a sister. Donna. She, uh... She died, when we were kids. "
Sinister Stephen Strange, How? 
Strange," We were... playing on a frozen lake, and... She fell through the ice. I couldn't save her. "
Sinister Stephen Strange," Sounds about right. But we don't talk about that, do we? "
Strange," No, we don't. I suppose your reality wasn't always like this? "
Sinister Stephen Strange," I suspect it'd be somewhat like yours, until... "
Strange, Until? 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Until I lost. 
Strange, To who? 
Sinister Stephen Strange, What do you want? 
Strange, I just want to get home. 
Sinister Stephen Strange," Yeah, believe me... I've been trying to leave this place for a long time. "
Strange, The Darkhold. You guard the Darkhold in this universe? 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Yeah. For good reason. 
Strange, That's a start. I could use it. It could help me to communicate with my universe. 
Sinister Stephen Strange, Careful. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll. 
Strange," I don't mean to be callous, but, how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact? "
Sinister Stephen Strange, Not just on its reality... On its reader. 
Strange," Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your own universe, but maybe, you could help to save mine? "
Sinister Stephen Strange," Are you happy, Stephen? "
Strange, What? 
Sinister Stephen Strange," Are you happy, Stephen? It's the question that... Christine Palmer asked me at her wedding. I said, yes, of course, I'm happy. I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods. What man wouldn't be happy? Then I, came back to this god darn haunted house. Sat down... and wondered why I'd lied. I never meant for any of this to happen. I was looking for a world where things were different. Where I had Christine. Where I was... happy. But I didn't find it. All I found were more of us. So I did those Stephens a favor. You ever had that dream where you're falling, as if you've been pushed off a tall building? That was probably me. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll. "
Strange," Okay. All the more reason to give it a rest, so let me have it. "
Sinister Stephen Strange, Here's the deal. I'll let you use the Darkhold... if you give me your Christine. 
Strange, Yeah... I don't think she's gonna go for that. 
Sinister Stephen Strange, No? Didn't think so. 
Strange, Hang on. We're coming. 
Strange, Slightly more than just dreamwalking. 
Strange," I know. You're right. We are all the same. But right now, that kid needs me, and I can't do any of this without your help. While I'm under, I need you to protect my body, in case they attack me for trespassing. "
Strange, The Souls of the Damned. 
Strange, Who said they have to be living? 
Souls of the Damned," Stephen Strange, possessing a dead body is forbidden! Cease your dreamwalk, and face the eternal consequences. "
Wong, Come on! Uh-oh. Strange! 
Wanda," Dreamwalking, you hypocrite! "
Strange," This time, it's gonna take more than killing me to kill me. "
Wong, I don't even wanna know. She's breaking free! 
Strange, Hold her! 
Wong, Strange! Take America's power. There's no other way. 
Strange," Yeah. This is the only way. It's me, in other me's body. "
America," You're gonna take my power, aren't you? Before Wanda can. It's okay. I understand now. "
Strange," No, America. I've come here to tell you to trust yourself, trust your power. That's how we stop her. "
America, I can't control it... 
Strange," Yes, you can. You have been all along. Every time you opened a portal, you sent us exactly where we needed to go. "
America, What about the first time? 
Strange, Even that led you to this moment. You are gonna kick that witch's ass. 
Wanda, Uh-huh. 
America, I can't b*at you. So I'll give you what you want. 
Wanda, Billy. Tommy. 
Billy, Mommy! 
Tommy, There's a witch! 
Wanda, What have you done?! 
Billy, Mommy! 
Wanda, I'm their mother! Get away from them. 
Strange, No. Not yet. 
Tommy, Mommy! 
Billy, Get away from our mom! Leave her alone! 
Wanda," Boys, stop. Please. Wait, boys. Stop. Stop it! "
Billy, Please don't hurt us. Please. 
Wanda, I would never hurt you. Never. I would never hurt anyone. I'm not a monster. I'm not... I'm... 
Tommy, Mom. You're okay. 
Wanda," Okay, okay... I'm okay... "
Tommy," Mom, no! "
Billy, Don't go. Don't. Mom... 
America, What now? 
Strange, Get out of here. 
America, I'll find you. We have to go. Now. 
Wanda, I opened the Darkhold. I have to close it. No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again. 
Strange, Are you all right? 
Strange, Yeah. 
Strange, She's on her way here to get us. 
Strange, No. So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe. 
Strange," Yes, she did. "
Strange, It's very beautiful. I wish I could show you. 
Strange," Yeah. Yeah, I know. "
Strange," I love you. I love you in every universe. It's not that I don't wanna care for someone, or have someone care for me. It's just... I get scared. "
America, How is this so much harder than a Multiversal portal? 
Strange," She needs to slow down, and be more patient. "
Wong, Reminds me of another student I knew. How are you feeling? 
Strange, Why do you ask? 
Wong, You used the Darkhold to dreamwalk into your own corpse. 
Strange," Oh. Yeah, right, uh... I'm fine. But I do wanna ask you something. Are you happy? "
Wong, That's a... interesting question. 
Strange," You'd think that saving the world would get you there, but... It doesn't. "
Wong," Sometimes, I do wonder... of my other lives. Yet I remain grateful in this one. Even with each tribulations. "
Strange, Soon we'll have to go through a long one. 
Wong," No, we don't. "
America, Wait. 'Sup? 
Strange, 'Sup?
America Chavez,</b> Made some sparks.
Doctor Stephen Strange,</b> Great. Your parents would be proud. I hope you'll get to show them one day.
America Chavez,</b> Stephen? I'm glad I found your universe.
Doctor Stephen Strange,"</b> So am I, kid. So am I. Hmm. (YELLING IN PAIN) (SCREAMING)"
 West," </b>This isn’t the time for showing off, Strange."
Christine Palmer," You know, you didn’t have to humiliate him in front of everyone."
Doctor Strange," I didn’t have to save his patient either. <i>[He dances slightly as when walks.]</i> But, you know, sometimes I just can’t help myself."
Pangborn," </b>Alright. I’d given up on my body. I thought my mind was the only thing I had left. I should at least try to elevate that. So I sat with gurus, and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men. And finally, I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated. And my spirit deepened. And somehow…"
Pangborn," </b>Yes. And there were deeper secrets to learn then, but I did not have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home. The place you’re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost is high."
 Stephen Strange, </b>How much?
Pangborn, </b>I’m not talking about money. Good luck.
Sign," ""Himalayan Healing!"
 Stephen Strange," </b>Guys, I… I don’t have any money."
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, please. It’s all I have left."
 Stephen Strange, </b>All right.
Mordo, </b>You’re looking for Kamar-Taj?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Really? Are you sure you got the right place? That one looks a little more...Kamar-Taj-y.
Mordo," </b>I once stood in your place. And I, too, was… disrespectful. So might I offer you some advice Forget everything you think you know."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Uh… alright.
Mordo," </b>The sanctuary of our teacher, the Ancient One."
 Stephen Strange," </b>The Ancient One? What’s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. I’m sorry. Thank you for… huh! Okay, that’s, uh… a thing…Thank you. Hello. Uh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you, Ancient One…for… seeing me…"
The Ancient One," </b>You’re very welcome. Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir. Mr. Strange!"
 Stephen Strange," </b>Doctor, actually."
The Ancient One," </b>Well, no. Not anymore, surely. Isn’t that why you’re here? You’ve undergone many procedures. Seven, right?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah…Good tea.
The Ancient One, </b>Yes.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man?
The Ancient One, </b>In a way.
 Stephen Strange, </b>You helped him to walk again.
The Ancient One, </b>Yes. 
 Stephen Strange, </b>How do you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?
The Ancient One," </b>Oh, I didn’t correct it. He couldn’t walk; I convinced him that he could."
 Stephen Strange, </b>You’re not suggesting it was psychosomatic?
The Ancient One," </b>When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you who heals it back together or the body?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>It’s the cells.
The Ancient One, </b>And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways.
 Stephen Strange, </b>That’s right. 
The Ancient One, </b>What if I told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?
 Stephen Strange," </b>You’re talking about cellular regeneration. That’s… bleeding-edge medical tech. Is that why you’re working here, without a governing medical board? I mean… just how experimental is your treatment?"
The Ancient One, </b>Quite.
 Stephen Strange," </b>So, you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?"
The Ancient One," </b>No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Spirit… to heal the body. Huh. A… Al… Al… alright. How do we do that? Where do we start?
The Ancient One, </b>Don’t like that map?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Oh, no. It’s… it’s very good. It’s just…you know, I’ve seen it before. In gift shops."
The Ancient One, </b>And what about this one?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?"
The Ancient One, </b>What about… that one?
 Stephen Strange, </b>You’re showing me an MRI scan? I can not believe this.
The Ancient One," </b>Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part, but not the whole."
 Stephen Strange," </b>I spent my last dollar getting here on a one-way ticket, and you’re talking to me about healing through belief?"
The Ancient One," </b>You’re a man who’s looking at the world through a keyhole, and you spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole. To see more, know more. And now, on hearing that it can be widened in ways you can’t imagine, you reject the possibility?"
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, and nothing more. We’re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe."
The Ancient One, </b>You think too little of yourself.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don’t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? "
The Ancient One, </b>I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What’s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?
The Ancient One, </b>Just tea. With a little honey.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What just happened? 
The Ancient One," </b>For a moment, you entered the astral dimension."
 Stephen Strange, </b>What?? 
The Ancient One, </b>A place where the soul exists apart from the body.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Why are you doing this to me?
The Ancient One, </b>To show you just how much you don’t know. Open your eye.
 Stephen Strange, </b>No! No… No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn’t real it isn’t real it isn’t
Mordo, </b>His heart rate are getting dangerously high.
The Ancient One," </b>He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving, others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie… ravenous… and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Teach me!
The Ancient One, </b>No.
 Stephen Strange," </b>No… No! No, no, no, no no no no! No! Open the door! Please!"
The Ancient One," </b>Thank you, Masters. You think I’m wrong to cast him out?"
Mordo," </b>5 hours later, he’s still on your doorstep. There’s a strength to him."
The Ancient One," </b>Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition…I’ve seen it all before."
Mordo, </b>He reminds you of Kaecilius?
The Ancient One," </b>I can not lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness."
Mordo, </b>You didn’t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.
The Ancient One," </b>We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them."
Mordo," </b>Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Don’t shut me out. I’ve nowhere else to go. Thank you.
Mordo," </b>Bathe, rest, meditate if you can. The Ancient One will send for you."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Uh, what’s this? My mantra?"
Mordo, </b>The Wi-Fi password. We’re not savages.
The Ancient One," </b>The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language ""spells"". But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it ""program"". The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic."
 Stephen Strange," </b>But… even if my fingers could do that, My hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there?"
The Ancient One," </b>How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Study and practice. Years of it. Hey.
Wong, </b>Mr. Strange.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Uh… Stephen, please. And you are?"
Wong, </b>Wong. 
 Stephen Strange, </b>Wong. Just Wong? Like… Adele? Or… Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem.
Wong," </b>The Book of the Invisible Sun, Astronomia Nova, Codex Imperium, Key of Solomon. You finished all of this?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yup.
Wong, </b>Come with me.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Alright.
Wong," </b>This section is for Masters only. But at my discretion, others may use it. We should start with Maxim’s Primer. How is your Sanskrit?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>I’m fluent in Google Translate.
Wong, </b>Read it. Classical Sanskrit.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What are those?
Wong, </b>The Ancient One’s private collection.
 Stephen Strange, </b>So they’re forbidden?
Wong, </b>No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.
 Stephen Strange, </b>This one’s got pages missing.
Wong," </b>That’s the book of Cagliostro. The study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master. A zealot called Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian, and relieved him of his head. I’m now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again, I’d know it. And you’d be dead before you ever left the compound."
 Stephen Strange," </b>What if it’s just overdue? You know? Any… late fees I should know about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm…Uh, you know, people used to think that I was funny."
Wong, </b>Did they work for you?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Alright. Well, it’s been lovely talking to you, thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life."
Kaecilius, </b>Now we receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world.
Mordo," </b>Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier, the gateway will come. And stop."
The Ancient One, </b>I’d like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.
Mordo, </b>Of course.
 Stephen Strange, </b>My hands.
The Ancient One, </b>It’s not about your hands.
 Stephen Strange, </b>How is this not about my hands?
The Ancient One," </b>Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own."
 Stephen Strange, </b>I… I control it by surrendering control? That doesn’t make any sense.
The Ancient One," </b>Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise. Come with me."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Wait. Is this…
The Ancient One, </b>Everest. It’s beautiful. 
 Stephen Strange," </b>Yeah, you’re right. Beautiful. It’s freezing, but… beautiful."
The Ancient One," </b>At this temperature, a person can last for 13 minutes before suffering permanent loss of function. "
 Stephen Strange, </b>Great.
The Ancient One, </b>But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes. 
 Stephen Strange, </b>What?
The Ancient One," </b>Surrender, Stephen."
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, no!!! Don’t!"
Mordo, </b>How is our new recruit?
The Ancient One, </b>We shall see. Any second now.
Mordo," </b>No, not again. Maybe I should…"
Wong, </b>Stephen.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Wong.
Wong," </b>What do you want, Strange?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Books on astral projection.
Wong, </b>You’re not ready for that.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Try me, Beyonce. Come on. You’ve heard of her. She’s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh come on, just give me the book, huh?"
Wong, </b>No.
The Ancient One," </b>Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now I’m told you question every lesson, preferring to teach yourself."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I’m being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense."
The Ancient One, </b>Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Wong told on me? 
The Ancient One," </b>You’re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension. Ever present but undetected. The real world isn’t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil, and sometimes to contain threats. You don’t want to be stuck in here without your sling ring."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?"
The Ancient One," </b>Learning of an infinite multiverse included learning of infinite dangers. And if I told you everything else that you don’t already know, you’d run from here in terror."
 Stephen Strange," </b>So, just how ancient is she?"
Mordo, </b>No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.
 Stephen Strange, </b>You follow her even though you don’t know?
Mordo," </b>I know that she’s steadfast, but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher. And don’t lose your way."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Like Kaecilius?
Mordo, </b>That’s right.
 Stephen Strange, </b>You knew him.
Mordo," </b>When he first came to us, he’d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving and broken man, searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. Questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep, seduced by false doctrine."
 Stephen Strange," </b>He stole the forbidden ritual, right?"
Mordo, </b>Yeah.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What did it do?
Mordo, </b>No more questions.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What’s that?
Mordo," </b>That’s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain, so we imbue objects with it, allowing them to take the strain we can not. This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics: the Wand of Watoomb, the Bolting Boots of Voltor."
 Stephen Strange," </b>They just roll of the tongue, don’t they? When do I get my relic?"
Mordo, </b>When you’re ready.
 Stephen Strange, </b>I think I’m ready.
Mordo," </b>You’re ready when the relic decides you’re ready. For now, conjure a weapon."
Mordo," </b>Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day, it may."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Wong? Okay. First, open the Eye of Agamotto. All right. Oh my. Dormammu. The Dark Dimension. Eternal life?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>I… I wa… I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!
 Stephen Strange," </b>Yeah, I don’t know. I hadn’t gotten to that part yet."
Mordo," </b>You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>They really should put the warnings before that stuff.
 Stephen Strange, </b>I’ve got a photographic memory. It’s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.
Mordo, </b>What you just did takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts.
 Stephen Strange," </b>And yet, my hands still shake."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Not forever?
Mordo, </b>We’re not prophets.
 Stephen Strange, </b>When do you start telling me what we are?
Mordo," </b>The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums."
 Stephen Strange, </b>From what?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Like Dormammu?
 Stephen Strange, </b>I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Uuuh… okay. Okay. I… time-out. I… I came here to heal my hands, not to fight in some mystical war."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Wong? Mordo?
Kaecilius, </b>Daniel. I see they made you Master of the Sanctum.
Master, </b>Do you know what that means?
Kaecilius, </b>That you’ll die protecting it.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Stop!
Kaecilius," </b>How long have you been at Kamar-TaJ, Mister…?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Doctor.
Kaecilius, </b>Mister Doctor?
 Stephen Strange, </b>It’s Strange.
Kaecilius," </b>Maybe. Who am I to judge? You don’t know how to use that, do you?"
Kaecilius," </b>You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. "
 Stephen Strange," </b>Why…look, I don’t even know what ""this"" is."
Kaecilius," </b>It’s the end and the beginning. The many becoming the few, becoming the One."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Look, if you’re not going to start making sense, I’m just going to have to put this thing back on."
Kaecilius," </b>Tell me, Mr. Doctor."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange."
Kaecilius, </b>You are a doctor?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yes. 
Kaecilius," </b>A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out, our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension… it’s a place beyond time."
 Stephen Strange, </b>That’s it. I’m putting this thing back on.
Kaecilius," </b>This world doesn’t have to die, Doctor. This world can take its rightful place among so many others, as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. And we can all live forever."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?
Kaecilius," </b>The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything."
 Stephen Strange, </b>What about the people you killed?
Kaecilius," </b>Tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see, you see what we’re doing? The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal, for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor…We don’t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution, the Why of all existence."
 Stephen Strange, </b>The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.
Kaecilius," </b>What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all. Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed, but instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. Have you ever wondered how she managed to live this long?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>I… I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.
Kaecilius," </b>So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down, to let the Dark Dimension in. Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely: life, everlasting. He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor, he is the savior of worlds."
 Stephen Strange," </b>No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that’s funny?"
Kaecilius," </b>No. No, Doctor. What’s funny is that you’ve lost your sling ring."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Dr. Palmer, where is she?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Where is she?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Christine!
Christine, </b>Stephen? Oh my god. What…
 Stephen Strange, </b>We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you. Now! I don’t have any time!
Christine, </b>What happened?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.
Christine, </b>What are you wearing?
Christine, </b>Stephen! Stephen!
 Stephen Strange, </b>Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle.
Christine," </b>Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>My astral body.
Christine, </b>Are you dead?
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, Christine, but I am dying."
Christine, </b>I’ve… I’ve never seen a wound like this before. What were you stabbed with?
 Stephen Strange, </b>I don’t know. I’m going to have to vanish now.
Christine," </b>No, I…"
 Stephen Strange," </b>Keep me alive, will you?"
Christine, </b>Okay! Okay.
Christine," </b>Stephen, come on."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Hit me again!
Christine, </b>Stop doing that!
 Stephen Strange, </b>Up the voltage and hit me again.
Christine," </b>No, your heart is beating!"
 Stephen Strange, </b>Just do it!
Christine," </b>After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body?"
 Stephen Strange," </b>Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded."
Christine, </b>Why would I?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more."
Christine," </b>Stop. You… you’re clearly in shock. I mean, what the hell is happening? Where have you been?"
 Stephen Strange," </b>Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu."
Christine, </b>Kathmandu?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah.
Christine," </b>What, like the Bob Seger song?"
 Stephen Strange," </b>1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I talked to someone called the Ancient One, and…"
Christine, </b>Oh. So you joined a cult.
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, I didn’t. Not exactly. I mean, they did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed."
Christine," </b>Yeah, that sounds like a cult."
 Stephen Strange, </b>It’s not a cult.
Christine," </b>Well, that’s what a cultist would say."
Christine," </b>Wait, Stephen… what do you think you’re doing?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>I’m late for a cult meeting.
Christine, </b>This is insane.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah.
Christine, </b>Where are you going?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Uhm…
Christine, </b>Just tell me the truth?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet."
Christine, </b>Okay. Don’t tell me. Fine.
 Stephen Strange, </b>I really do have to go.
Mordo, </b>Strange! You’re okay.
 Stephen Strange," </b>A relative term, but yeah, I’m okay."
Mordo, </b>The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you.
The Ancient One, </b>No minor feat. It’s a fickle thing.
 Stephen Strange, </b>He’s escaped.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will.
The Ancient One, </b>He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah.
The Ancient One, </b>How many more?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Two. I stranded one in the desert.
 Stephen Strange, </b>His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer.
Mordo, </b>He’s been taken back to Kamar-Taj.
The Ancient One," </b>You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its Master gone, it needs another, Master Strange."
 Stephen Strange," </b>No. It is Dr. Strange. Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I’m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them."
The Ancient One, </b>You become a doctor to save one life above all others: your own.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Still seeing through me, are you?"
The Ancient One," </b>I see what I’ve always seen: your over-inflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything, even death, which no one can control. Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality.
The Ancient One, </b>It’s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Like you feed on him? You talk to me about controlling death. Well, I know how you do it. I’ve seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro."
The Ancient One," </b>Measure your next words very carefully, doctor."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Because you might not like them?
The Ancient One, </b>Because you may not know of what you speak.
Mordo, </b>What is he talking about?
 Stephen Strange," </b>I’m talking about her long life, the source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive."
Mordo, </b>That’s not true.
 Stephen Strange, </b>I’ve seen the rituals and worked them out. I know how you do it.
The Ancient One," </b>Once they regroup, the zealots will be back. You’ll need reinforcements."
 Stephen Strange, </b>She is not who you think she is.
Mordo, </b>You don’t have the right to say that. You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, and I don’t want to know."
Mordo, </b>You’re a coward.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Because I’m not a killer?
Mordo," </b>These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first?"
 Stephen Strange, </b>What do you think I just did?
Mordo, </b>You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog.
 Stephen Strange, </b>When you would have done it so easily?
Mordo, </b>You have no idea the things I’ve done…And the answer is yes. Without hesitation.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Even if there’s another way?
Mordo, </b>There is no other way.
 Stephen Strange, </b>You lack imagination.
Mordo," </b>No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They’re back. We have to end this. Now! Strange! Get down here and fight!"
 Stephen Strange," </b>The Mirror Dimension. You can’t affect the real world in here. Who’s laughing now, asshole?"
Kaecilius, </b>I am.
 Stephen Strange," </b>They’ve got no sling ring. I mean, they can’t escape, right?"
Mordo," </b>Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can’t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn’t clever. This was suicide!"
 Stephen Strange, </b>This was a mistake.
Mordo, </b>It’s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.
The Ancient One, </b>Kaecilius.
Kaecilius," </b>I came to you broken, lost, bleeding. I trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies."
The Ancient One, </b>I tried to protect you.
Kaecilius, </b>From the truth? 
The Ancient One, </b>From yourself.
Kaecilius, </b>I have a new teacher now.
The Ancient One," </b>Dormammu deceives you You have no idea of what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment."
Kaecilius, </b>Liar.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Christine!!!
Christine, </b>Are you kidding me? Oh my god.
 Stephen Strange, </b>No fibrillation…
Christine, </b>It’s neurogenic?
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yes. Nick? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What are you doing? You’re dying! You have to return to your body now. You don’t have time.
The Ancient One," </b>Time is relative. Your body hasn’t even hit the floor yet. I’ve spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can’t see past it. I’ve prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there’s always another. And they all lead here, but never further."
 Stephen Strange, </b>You think this is where you die.
The Ancient One, </b>Do you wonder what I see in your future?
 Stephen Strange, </b>No. Yes. 
The Ancient One," </b>I never saw your future, only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled, but not because you crave success, but because of your fear of failure."
 Stephen Strange, </b>It’s what made me a great doctor.
The Ancient One, </b>It’s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Which is?
The Ancient One," </b>It’s not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn’t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body."
 Stephen Strange,</b>He uses magic to walk.
The Ancient One," </b>Constantly. He had a choice: to return to to his own life, or to serve something greater than himself."
 Stephen Strange," </b>So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?"
The Ancient One," </b>You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I’ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension, but as you well know, sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Mordo won’t see it that way.
The Ancient One," </b>Mordo’s soul is rigid and unmovable, forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu."
 Stephen Strange, </b>I’m not ready.
The Ancient One," </b>No one ever is. We don’t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered, your time is short. You’d think after all this time I’d be ready. But look at me: stretching one moment out into a thousand, just so I can watch the snow."
Christine, </b>Are you okay?
 Stephen Strange," </b>You said that losing my hands didn’t have to be the end, that it could be a beginning."
Christine, </b>Yeah.
 Stephen Strange,</b>A harder way.
Christine, </b>A weirder way.
 Stephen Strange, </b>I don’t want to let you go.
Wong, </b>Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius.
Kaecilius," </b>You’re on the wrong side of history, Wong."
 Stephen Strange, </b>She’s dead.
Mordo, </b>You were right. She wasn’t who I thought she was.
 Stephen Strange, </b>She was complicated.
Mordo," </b>Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile, dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life."
 Stephen Strange, </b>She did what she thought was right.
Mordo," </b>The bill comes due. Don’t you see? Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault. And here we are, in the consequence of her deception: a world on fire."
 Stephen Strange," </b>Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen, and New York has been attacked. Twice. You know where they’re going next. Hong Kong. You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I can not defeat them alone."
Mordo, </b>The Sanctum has already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It’s too late. Nothing can stop him. 
 Stephen Strange, </b>Not necessarily.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Spells working. We got a second chance.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Wong! I’m breaking the laws of nature, I know."
Wong," </b>Well, don’t stop now."
Kaecilius, </b>You can’t fight the inevitable. Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Beyond time…
Kaecilius, </b>He’s gone. Stephen Strange has left to surrender to his power.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu," </b>You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world, like all worlds."
 Stephen Strange, </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu, </b>You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world...What is this? Illusion? 
 Stephen Strange," </b>No, this is real."
Dormammu, </b>Good.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu, </b>You… what is happening?
 Stephen Strange," </b>Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension, I’ve brought a little power from mine. This is time: endless looped time."
Dormammu, </b>You dare!
 Stephen Strange, </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu, </b>You cannot do this forever.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Actually, I can. This is how things are now: you and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly."
Dormammu, </b>Then you will spend eternity dying.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.
Dormammu, </b>But you will suffer.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Pain is an old friend. Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu, </b>You will never win.
 Stephen Strange," </b>No…But I can lose...again, and again, and again, and again, forever. "
 Stephen Strange, </b>And that makes you my prisoner.
Dormammu, </b>No...
Dormammu, <i>STOP!</i> MAKE THIS <i>STOP!!!!</i></b>
Dormammu, <i>SET ME FREE!</i></b>
 Stephen Strange, </b>No. I’ve come to bargain.
Dormammu,</b><i>...what do you want?</i>
 Stephen Strange," </b>Take your zealots from the Earth, end your assault on my world, never come back: do it, and I’ll break the loop."
Kaecilius, </b>Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. 
Kaecilius, </b>What have you done?
 Stephen Strange, </b>I made a bargain.
Kaecilius, </b>What is this? 
 Stephen Strange," </b>Well, it’s, uh…it’s everything you ever wanted: eternal life as part of the One. You’re not going to like it. I think he really should have stolen the whole book, because the warnings… the warnings come after the spells."
Wong," </b>Oh, that’s funny."
Mordo," </b>You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always. A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer."
 Stephen Strange,"</b> Yeah, it’s okay."
Wong,"</b> Wise choice. You’ll wear the Eye of Agamotto once you’ve mastered its powers. Until then, best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone."
 Stephen Strange,</b> A what?
Wong,"</b> You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One’s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready."
 Stephen Strange,</b> We’ll be ready.
 Stephen Strange, </b>Tea?
Thor, </b>I don’t drink tea.
 Stephen Strange, </b>What do you drink?
Thor, </b>Not tea.
 Stephen Strange," </b>So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings."
Thor, </b>A worthy inclusion.
 Stephen Strange," </b>Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York?"

Whitey," Oh, sorry, I’m not up on modern technology. But I guess my friend Davey is."
Benjamin," First night, I got a basketball and some dreidels. Then, night two I got a pup"
Davey, Wow. Maybe on night four the Chanukah monster will take a big crap on your
Jennifer," Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit, psycho. Come on Benjamin, help me clean"
Benjamin, See you at the game tomorrow.
Whitey, She happens to be going through a tough time
Davey, So she’s available?
Whitey," Oh, you wish, mac. You"
Davey, Twenty years?
Whitey, I’m surprised you have enough brain cells left to remember.
Davey," Hey, Jennifer, you still coming over to watch “Dukes of Hazzard”"
Jennifer, That’s a big 10
 Stone," Hey, Davey."
 Stone," Thanks, honey."
Davey," If my parents fall asleep early, I’ll show you my basement."
Whitey," Ah, they make a nice couple boogie"
Whitey," Good evening, Mayor Stuey Duhy. Out for some late"
Mayor, Yeah. Then I have to figure out how to rebuild our giant menorah and Santa.
Davey, I’m just here to say I’m sorry to the little guy. I swear.
Eleanore, I can’t believe I’m in the same room as the mayor.
Whitey, I can’t believe how many rolls you put in your purse.
Eleanore, It’ll be a nice snack for February.
Mayor," Ladies and gentlemen, this next award, the Dukesberry"
Whitey, I’m not nervous. I’m excited. I’ve been waiting 35 years for this night.
Davey," Good job, fellas."
Mayor, Hand
Mayor, ...Tom Baltezor!
Man," Attaboy, Tommy!"
Eleanore, All of people can bite my germ

CDW, WOW! Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.
Tom, And even though I don’t recall scoring a point during my four seasons of play
Man, Thanks for the scoreboard!
Woman," Thank you, Tommy!"
Davey, Excuse me! Can I just say something?
Mayor," Stone, what are you doing here?"
CDW, I LOVE IT!
Judge," Stone, you screwed up for the last time. That ten"
Townspeople, Yeah!
Jennifer, Finally.
Townspeople, Yeah!
Mayor," Okay, Mrs. Triple"
Davey," I know you people don’t like me, I know you don’t care about my opinion, but"
Tom, Why would we give Whitey Duvall the patch? So he could use it as a blanket.
Mayor, Ow! Oww! Oww!!
Davey, That’s the reaction I thought I get.
Whitey, That place always makes me feel better.
Whitey, Maybe the nigh
Eleanore," Well, if he didn’t, we can at least sit in front of it. These are desperate times!"
Whitey," Let the door be open. Please, just give me that."
Eleanore," Oh, thank god!"

Mayor," Whitey, tonight for the first time in years, your"

Mayor," No, Eleanore. He made me open my eyes to see what a great man your brother is"
Tom, Oww!
Mayor," Whitey Duvall, for service to the league and this community, I proudly present to"
Whitey, But this is Tom’s.
Tom," Mr. Duvall, the 35"

Eleanore," Oh, Whitey!"
Whitey," You stepped up for me, Stone. I don’t know if I could ever repay you."
Davey," Well, you can help me with my dream."
Whitey, You got a dream? What is it?
Davey, To have someone wish me a happy Chanukah and feel as good as I used
Whitey," Happy Chanukah, Stone."
Davey," Merry Christmas, Whitey."
Townspeople, Awww...
Whitey," You know, Stone, if my imaginary wife and I ever have a son, I hope you"
Davey," Thanks, Whit"
Whitey, Appreciate it.
Eleanore, And when Benjamin falls asleep the
Davey, Sounds good to me.
Narrator," Don’t worry, folks. Whitey’s okay."
Narrator," See, I told you."
Whitey, Yeaa...
Jesse Pinkman,</b> You know he's not gonna be happy.
Mike Ehrmantraut,"</b> No, I suspect he won't. Only you can decide what's best for you, Jesse. Not him, not me..."
Jesse,"</b> I'm out. So, what are you gonna do with all that money?"
Mike,"</b> Same thing I do with all the other money. How 'bout you, teenage retiree? You'll be living the dream."
Jesse,</b> Not sure I should stick around town...
Mike,"</b> Well, that's a start."
Jesse,"</b> Nothing really keeping me here. Where would you go, if you were me?"
Mike,</b> Doesn't matter; I'm not you.
Jesse,"</b> Seriously, c'mon. Like, if you were my age...? Just play along, make some conversation."
Mike,</b> Alaska.
Jesse,</b> Yeah?
Mike,"</b> Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh... Alaska. It's the last frontier. Up there, you can be anything you want."
Jesse,</b> Alaska... Start over. Start fresh...
Mike,</b> One could.
Jesse,</b> Put things right.
Mike,"</b> No. Sorry, kid, that's the one thing you can never do."
Badger,"</b> Dude, you suck!"
Skinny Pete,"</b> This thing's, like, defective and shit! There's, like, Cheeto dust in the controller."
Badger,"</b> It's a bad carpenter that blames his hammer, yo."
Skinny Pete,</b> Whatever.
Badger,</b> You're apexing too early. You're apexing too early--!
Skinny Pete,"</b> I'm apexing at the apex, bitch! Don't be telling me how to drive and shit! You couldn't drive a two-button elevator."
Badger,</b> You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.
Skinny Pete,</b> Whatever that means... You couldn't drive a short bus full of slow kids to the zoo.
Badger,"</b> Yeah, that's because I'd be too distracted by you! You'd be sitting up front in your special helmet, trying to hump my leg. On account, you couldn't drive Thelma and Louise off of that cliff! <i>Apex!</i>"
Skinny Pete,</b> I can't apex more than I'm already apexing!
Badger,</b> <i>[huffs]</i> You drive like a blind guy with no legs!
Skinny Pete,</b> Don't you-- You drive like my dead grandmoms!
Badger,</b> That's disrespectful.
Skinny Pete,"</b> ...Dude, you lost?"
Badger,</b> <i>[Offscreen]</i> Who is it?
Skinny Pete,</b> Jesse...?
Badger,</b> Who is it--?
Jesse,</b> I gotta get that car off the street.
Badger,"</b> Yo, yo--!"
Badger,</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Come check out what's on TV.
Jesse,"</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Man, what's wrong with you? I ain't watching no TV right now!"
Badger,</b> <i>(whispering)</i> It's the news...
Female Anchor,</b> <i>[Voice over]</i> Is it true that a military-grade firearm was altered and used to carry out this attack?
DEA Head,"</b> To the best of my knowledge, it was an M16 Machine Gun which, yes, that's strictly military-issue weapon. As to where he could've obtained such a weapon or the so-called, uh... ""remote control"" aspect of it, anything I can say at this point would just be conjecture and I'm not going to engage in that."
DEA Head,</b> Yes.
Male Anchor,"</b> Could you tell us more about this Person of Interest? We're hearing a lot of conflicting information about whether this person took part in the killings, or whether they were, in fact -- I guess the word we keep hearing is ""liberated"". Were they liberated by White from some sort of captivity?"
DEA Head,"</b> I'm not prepared at this time to say any more than that; they're our Person of Interest, and they may have information relevant to this case or other cases the DEA is investigating."
Badger,"</b> Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's-- Jesse! Hey, hey! Hey!"
Jesse,</b> Who's there?!
Badger,"</b> It's cool, man, it's us!"
Skinny Pete,"</b> It's us! It's us, Jesse, you're safe! It's us..."
Skinny Pete,"</b> My stuff's gonna fit you like a tee, yo! Not like if you had to borrow from Sasquatch over here..."
Badger,</b> Can't help it that I'm sized for love.
Skinny Pete,"</b> Yeah, you go love all the giraffes you want, bitch. Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies. Yeah, this here's barely worn!"
Skinny Pete,</b> How's this working for you? Good?
Skinny Pete,</b> Jesse...?
Skinny Pete,"</b> Right on! Get you some new clothes, then... A shower'll make you feel a whole lot better! Truth be told, you look like you're hurting for one..."
Badger,</b> Church. No offense.
Skinny Pete,"</b> Got you a clean towel, the one on the right. Uh, kinda. And, um, feel free to open a new bar of Irish Spring, whatever. It's underneath, yo, 'cause the old one has, like, hairs on it and shit, and uh... Uh, yo! I got Axe Body Spray, I got Obsession For Men, I got Tommy Hilfinger, feel free to use any of 'em you want, y'know, use 'em all..."
Badger,"</b> Obsession's the bomb, yo. I got it for him for Christmas."
Skinny Pete,"</b> Oh, uh... Hey! Um... Maybe don't like... Shave and whatnot, y'know. Uh, be less recognizable?"
Badger,"</b> Jesse, did they really..."
Jesse,</b> ...what?
Badger,</b> Did they really keep you in a cage?
Skinny Pete,"</b> Whoa, dude, why'd you--?!"
Badger,"</b> Lookin' sharp, yo."
Skinny Pete,</b> Yeah... Lookin' sharp! Feel like a new man?
Jesse,</b> Yeah. Thanks.
Badger,</b> You want a little something to take the edge off?
Jesse,"</b> Why'd you, uh, turn off the TV? News that bad?"
Badger,"</b> There's just, uh, a whole lot of it."
Jesse,</b> Yeah. I gotta get out of here.
Badger,</b> ...Where to? You got a plan?
Jesse,</b> Maybe.
Jesse,"</b> Hey, uh... Skinny. You got a burner you can give me?"
Skinny Pete,</b> Fully charged and clean as a whistle.
Jesse,</b> First... I gotta get rid of that car.
Old Joe,</b> Go for Joe.
Old Joe,"</b> Yeah, I know who this is. At this point, who doesn't?"
Jesse,</b> Hey.
Old Joe,</b> Where's the victim?
Jesse,"</b> Uh, it's in the back. Thank you so much for doing this, Joe. Listen, about the money, if we can make it--"
Old Joe,</b> It's on the house. Good kid; least I could do.
Skinny Pete,"</b> Watch it, bitch!"
Old Joe,"</b> You gentlemen threw me plenty of business back in the day, I got no complaints in that department. ""Magnets!"" Yeah? That was a good one."
Jesse,</b> Joe...
Old Joe,"</b> Frankly, y'know, I can tell you now... I had zero confidence that that would work. None whatsoever, but hey! Live and learn."
Jesse,"</b> Joe, what are you doing?"
Old Joe,"</b> Writing myself a little insurance policy. Y'know, strictly precautionary... Belt and suspenders... Okay! Alright, mind at ease. I think we're good."
Old Joe,</b> Whoa!
Jesse,"</b> Joe! Joe! Hey-- Joe, what are you doing?!"
Old Joe,"</b> Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same. LoJack; the company just activated it, just this minute. Talk about timing!"
Jesse,</b> Just--
Old Joe,"</b> Look, Johnny Law is on his way, as in here, as in now, so farewell, goodbye, regrets, et cetera, et cetera. "
Jesse,</b> Joe--!
Jesse,</b> Skinny... I'm sorry. Who's got the keys to that car? Keys!
Jesse,"</b> Yo. Yo, what are you doing?! We gotta get this thing outta here!"
Skinny Pete,"</b> Badger, gimme the keys to your Fiero."
Badger,</b> Why?
Skinny Pete,"</b> Now, you take my car."
Badger,"</b> I don't even like your car. <i>[After Skinny jingles the keys, he takes them.]</i> ...it drives like a dick..."
Skinny Pete,"</b> Badger drives my T-Bird two, three-hundred miles away, then ditches it. Think you'll be heading to Mexico?"
Jesse,</b> No. Not Mexico.
Skinny Pete,"</b> Right on, even better! <i>[To Badger]</i> Leave it near the border. Hide it, kinda? But, yo, don't hide it so good the cops can't find it. Wipe it down for prints, then hitchhike back. Don't let nobody see you in that car! <i>[To Jesse]</i> You, take Badger's Fiero."
Jesse,</b> What about Badger's car?
Skinny Pete,"</b> It stays right here! Ain't like the cops don't already know where it is! I'll tell 'em you dropped by, the two of us smoked a fat bowl, traded pink slips, then you split! I always wanted me an El Camino, and that's church, yo. I'll pass any lie detector they give me! It's what's happening... You got any cash?"
Skinny Pete,"</b> Yo, kick in, bitch!"
Badger,</b> I'm doin' it! Jesus... 
Jesse,"</b> Guys, I don't know what to say..."
Skinny Pete,</b> Don't say nothin'. Just go!
Skinny Pete,"</b> Seatbelt. Speed limit. You got about three hours to get this thing down south. I'll keep my mouth shut 'til then, but after that? They gonna be putting an APB out on this bitch."
Badger,"</b> I'll get her there. Take care of her, Jesse. She's a special lady."
Skinny Pete,"</b> That right there is a clown car. No self-respecting outlaw would ever get caught dead in that thing. That's why it's perfect, yo, deep cover!"
Badger,"</b> <i>Vaya con Dios</i>, amigo."
Jesse,"</b> Oh, T-- Uh, the El Camino, let me see the keys..."
Skinny Pete,"</b> Hold up. <i>[Pete hands Jesse his beanie.]</i> Just might keep you from getting spotted. Can't hurt, right?"
Jesse,"</b> Yo, Skinny... Why are you doing all this?"
Skinny Pete,</b> Dude... You're my hero 'n shit.
Todd,</b> Jesse? You awake? Jesse?
Jesse,</b> Yeah.
Todd,</b> Everything good?
Jesse,</b> Yeah. Good.
Todd,</b> Great! You want a cigarette?
Jesse,</b> Thanks...
Todd,</b> Yeah! Guy on the TV keeps calling for rain. What do you think?
Jesse,"</b> Uh, I don't know."
Todd,"</b> Guy said, like, f-- Forty percent chance yesterday? Sixty percent today... Maybe it was even fifty, yesterday. But so far... I mean, I-- Yeah, I see clouds, but I-- I wouldn't call 'em rainclouds, just regular... Regular ""cloud"" clouds. Anyway, that's what they look like to me."
Jesse,"</b> Yeah, well those guys aren't... always that accurate."
Todd,"</b> Yeah, right. I'm not putting myself out there as any kinda expert or whatnot, but I do think it's gonna be... a beautiful afternoon. And guess what? We're all alone!"
Jesse,</b> ...yeah?
Todd,"</b> Yeah, Uncle Jack took everybody down to Elephant Butte on account of, he got this new Chaparral. It's pretty badass, but I told him I'm not really... big into water skiing, plus somebody's gotta take care of you. It took some convincing, but now... it's just you and me the whole weekend. I-- I'd really like your help with something."
Todd,"</b> So... I-- I hate to be all like... But we gotta talk ground rules, uh, if you try to, y'know, escape... I'm gonna have to visit the little boy, it'll basically be out of my hands at that point. Uncle Jack made you that promise, and he's gonna wanna stick to it, so... good behavior, right? Right? Good. I appreciate it, Jesse. "
Todd,"</b> Gotta make sure you don't draw too much attention. I'm gonna do a better job of keeping you clean from now on, 'kay? I promise."
Todd,</b> Good job.
Todd,"</b> Hey, check this out! There's no water in it. There used to be water in it, a couple years ago, but they took it out because of some insurance thing. Okay, so, it's not actually that heavy but, uh... Try as I might, I can't ever get this thing on by myself. What are you better at, going forwards or backwards?"
Todd,"</b> Okay, well. let's both go sideways for a while."
Todd,</b> <i>[grunts]</i> Watch your fingers.
Todd,"</b> I thought maybe I could just hang it from the ceiling here, just drive right under and dump it in, but my landlord didn't really like that idea. I guess that's good. I found this thing on Craigslist, so... Yeah!"
Jesse,"</b> So, is that what you... needed help with?"
Todd,</b> Part of it.
Radio Anchor,"</b> The drug kingpin once known throughout the southwest as ""Heisenberg"" may yet claim a final victim. Texas authorities investigating the poisoning of a Houston woman are looking into her possible connection to Walter White's criminal organization. The unnamed woman who is hospitalized in critical condition is not expected to survive. White, the former Albuquerque school teacher who was the subject of a six-month international manhunt, was found dead late Tuesday at the scene of a gang massacre which claimed the lives of nine people."
Radio Anchor,"</b> <i>(distant)</i> The dollar is down on the foreign exchange markets after a seemingly turbulent week for the Euro. The DOW Jones is down 15 points, the NASDAQ is down 34 points, and the S&amp;P 500 is up 10 points..."
Lou,"</b> Hey there, look what the cat dragged in! Did I hear voices? Were you talking to somebody?"
Todd,"</b> Nope, not that I know of. Hey there, Lou, whatcha up to?"
Lou,"</b> A little horticulture maintenance, uh, this ficus down at your end's been looking kinda puny! Gotta keep the thrift bugs off it."
Todd,"</b> So, is a ficus technically a plant or a tree?"
Lou,"</b> I'd say it all depends, uh, keep in mind, you got over 800 species up in the garden."
Todd,"</b> Wow! Well, alright, Lou, you have a good one!"
Lou,"</b> Yeah, don't take any wood nickels!"
Todd,"</b> Whoa, man! That guy... he's not supposed to be home at this hour. We really lucked out that he didn't see you. He's just always lurking around, being nosy... I mean, he was in Vietnam, which I totally respect, but still... How do you like my place?"
Jesse,"</b> Uh, yeah, it's-- it's nice. Kinda... pastel, but in a good way."
Todd,"</b> Yeah, right? I-- I was thinking of easter eggs. But... Lately I'm thinking I might like to try some new paint, this stuff is starting to feel pretty tired."
Jesse,"</b> Okay. So, you-- Sure, that's why I'm here, so you want me to help you paint?"
Todd,"</b> Maybe! Yeah, if we have some time left over, but first, um... "
Jesse,"</b> Oh, shit! Jesus! Todd! What...? What--? Oh, shit!"
Todd,"</b> Okay, please don't, y'know... Make me feel worse than I already do."
Jesse,</b> Who is this?!
Todd,"</b> Sonya, the cleaning lady. And, honestly... I don't feel much like talking about it, so. You wanna give me a hand, Jesse?"
Todd,"</b> Just keep it straight. Oh, well- w- wait, uh... Unroll it."
Todd,</b> Kinda need this!
Todd,"</b> Okay. Now we just gotta wait for Nosy Lou to go bowling. I think he leaves in, like, an hour. You want some soup? You want soup? I got chicken noodle, chicken stars, cream of chicken... Ah, bean with bacon! One left, Jesse."
Jesse,</b> What did she do to you?
Todd,"</b> What? Oh, she didn't... Do anything to me."
Jesse,</b> Then... why?
Todd,"</b> Right there. That book, if you wanna know so bad. Uncle Jack taught me, always keep my money close. So... I have these old World Book Encyclopedias, the whole entire set, A to Z. My Grammy gave 'em to me. I was in middle school, but I figured ""nobody needs books anymore 'cause everything's on the computer"". Uh, seemed like a good hiding place. Plus, I had all these other volumes left to fill."
Jesse,</b> So your cleaning lady was stealing your money?
Todd,"</b> What? No! She was as honest as the day is long. Like, George Washington honest. But she found it, and I can't have anybody finding it. She brought it straight in here to show me. She actually thought I didn't know it was there. I just-- I-- wondered what the heck she was looking up. She barely spoke any English. 'M' for Mexico, maybe? I dunno. It was weird."
Jesse,</b> Where are you gonna take her?
Todd,"</b> Some place pretty. She deserves that. Hey, do me a favor and put that away, would you? Just straight down the hall, all the way in the back, there's a whole shelf of 'em. Thanks. Sure you don't want any soup?"
Todd,"</b> How do you like my bedroom? Pretty bitchin', huh?"
Todd,</b> Be sure to alphabetize 'em!
Todd,</b> Guess I better come up with a new hiding place for my money.
Jesse,"</b> ...They got these things called ""banks""."
Todd,"</b> Actually, I think I know the perfect spot. It might take a little engineering, but... I mean, it would be right here. Nobody would ever find it. Nothing beats cash on hand, that's what Uncle Jack says."
Diane Pinkman,</b> --an average kid.
Adam Pinkman,"</b> Yeah, he-- He liked to draw, he was good at that. "
Female News Anchor,</b> When was the last time you saw him?
Adam,"</b> Uh... A year? Maybe more? I mean, it was way before August."
Female News Anchor,</b> Is there anything you wish you could say to your son right now?
Diane,"</b> Please... Come forward. Too many people have... For your sake, for everybody's sake. Son, turn yourself in."
Todd,</b> You wanna say a few words?
Jesse,</b> ...no!
Todd,</b> Nice-- Nice lady. Excellent housekeeper.
Todd,"</b> Um-- Hey, grab another pack, wouldja? There should be one in the glovebox."
Todd,</b> You find 'em?
Todd,"</b> I'll take that, Jesse."
Todd,"</b> Jesse, I'll-- I'll take that."
Todd,"</b> On the way home, I was gonna get us some pizza. A couple large pies. Maybe a six pack of beers. Some ice cold beer. That sound good? 'Cause- 'cause you earned it today, you definitely did. What kinda pizza do you like, Jesse?"
Todd,"</b> Jesse, what kinda pizza?"
Jesse,</b> Pepperoni.
Todd,"</b> Pepperoni, sure. Classic! I like that, too."
Todd,</b> Aw. Look at that view. Should be a heck of a sunset! You know what Uncle Jack says? That life is what you make it...
Jesse,</b> God...
Jesse,</b> Yeah!
Casey,</b> Jesus...
Casey,</b> Jesus!
Lou,</b> Hello?
Lou,"</b> Oh, hey, you folks are back, huh? Wow...  When you search a place, you really search it!"
Neil,"</b> Sir, what can I do for you?"
Lou,"</b> Well, I'm Louis Schanzer, I live across the hall down in Unit 11. I talked to your guys yesterday; I got a card from one of your Sergeants. I just want you to know, I'm around if you ever need any additional information."
Neil,</b> M'kay. Great.
Lou,"</b> See, I knew the decedent pretty well, never really trusted him. Be honest? I kinda saw this thing comin'. I mean-- Well, not exactly, but kinda."
Neil,"</b> Great. Well, we'll definitely keep that in mind."
Casey,</b> Yeah. Definitely. Thank you!
Lou,</b> You guys have business cards?
Casey,"</b> No, I'm-- I'm sorry, we're fresh out. Just take it easy."
Lou,"</b> You too, and hey, listen. You ever need any help with this case, I've done a little investigating myself, I--"
Neil,"</b> Okay... I'll start here, you start in the back, let's meet in the middle."
Casey,"</b> I mean, Jesus..."
Casey,"</b> Neil, they tossed the shit outta this place! What's left to find?"
Neil,</b> Shut up and look!
Neil,</b> What are you doing?
Jesse,</b> Taking my half.
Neil,"</b> Wow, yeah? You a little man with big dreams? Yeah? Hey, if I were you, I'd walk the hell out of here right now."
Neil,"</b> I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch. I will <i>shoot</i> you."
Jesse,"</b> Then do it, already. If I don't get this money, I am dead anyway. Alright, and if you pull that trigger, then you are gonna have to kill that loudmouth down the hall and every other witness in the place. And you will be as fucked as I am. So... What's it gonna be?"
Neil,</b> Three-way split and you got your third. No pushing.
Customer,</b> It's colorful. I'll say that much.
Ed,"</b> Yes, it is! Uh, I don't expect you to ever lose it in your closet."
Customer,</b> Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?
Ed,</b> That's correct. A lot of our customers find that handy and practical.
Customer,</b> But they want an arm and a leg to pay for it. And I ain't paying for no paint job.
Ed,"</b> Yes, I agree, it's very expensive. But it's a fine product. But if you are in love with your Kirby, I'll bet I can get it working for you again."
Ed,"</b> Uh, be with you in a minute."
Customer,"</b> Fixing my Kirby, how much would that cost?"
Ed,"</b> Well, I won't know until I take a good look at it, and if it, uh-- Now, if it needed a new motor, it'd be a little bit expensive, but certainly not as expensive as a new Dyson. The estimate's free and, uh, all you gotta do is bring it in here."
Customer,</b> I may take you up on that.
Ed,</b> Excellent!
Customer,</b> If I can get my niece to help me.
Ed,"</b> Yes, they do. Now, I want you to promise you won't try and bring it in by yourself -- get that help."
Customer,</b> Mm. I just don't know why they can't make things that last any more.
Ed,"</b> Oh, you're singing my song! I want you to have a great day, now!"
Customer,"</b> Thank you! Thanks for your help, I'll be back with my Kirby."
Ed,</b> Excellent! Drive carefully.
Ed,"</b> If there's any questions I can help you with, just let me know."
Ed,</b> I'd appreciate if you wouldn't do that -- I'm open for business.
Jesse,"</b> Um, I need a... Hoover Max, Pressure Max, Max Pressure. Hoover, maybe it's a Pro Max. You got, like a-- Like, a filter?"
Ed,</b> Hoover products are right over there on the wall behind you.
Jesse,"</b> Look, I don't remember the exact password, alright? But it was a vacuum thing. Okay, fine."
Jesse,"</b> Here you go. Four, six, ten... Fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-five. There you go. 125 thousand."
Jesse,"</b> C'mon, man, you know why I'm here!"
Ed,"</b> I can't say I do, no."
Jesse,"</b> Yeah, you do! You're the guy! Yeah, you <i>do</i>! You're <i>the guy!</i> Look, I am 96 percent sure that you are the guy, so why don't you just, like, admit it? Oh-- Look, alright?"
Jesse,"</b> No wire! Okay, no wire! And no gun. 'kay? And nobody knows I'm here. I just need... I just need your services. Alright, on the day at the pickup spot, you pulled up in a minivan. A red Toyota minivan, looks like a kidney bean -- same exact minivan you got parked out back, alright? I saw it! Alright... You got rules, alright? I get that, and I apologize, seriously. I didn't go with you that day, and I am sorry. Look, you will never know how sorry, but I am <i>here</i> now, alright? And I have cash. So please, okay? Please..."
Ed,</b> You owe me for that first pickup.
Jesse,"</b> YES! Oh, you're the guy--! What?!"
Ed,"</b> This... <i>[He points at the money.]</i> is previously owed. Going forward, were we to, would require an additional 125."
Jesse,"</b> Alright. Fair's fair. Deal's a deal, alright? Look --"
Jesse,"</b> Four, eight, ten, fourteen, eighteen, twenty... twenty one... Twenty two. Twenty two... Twenty three--"
Ed,"</b> By my arithmetic, you're ten thousand shy."
Jesse,</b> 82 hundred. 82 hundred.
Ed,</b> May I borrow this?
Jesse,</b> What are you doing?
Ed,</b> I am gathering your belongings.
Jesse,"</b> No, no, no... No, no, no, stop--!"
Ed,</b> I'm not gonna try to collect what you owe me. I don't think it would end well for either one of us. This is not an inconsequential amount of money.
Jesse,"</b> Hey, listen to me--!"
Ed,"</b> Spend it wisely, it will last you for years."
Jesse,"</b> Please, you don't understand!"
Ed,"</b> Keep a low profile, travel by night."
Jesse,</b> No--!
Ed,"</b> With a little luck, you will find yourself many miles from here. Godspeed to you."
Jesse,</b> So that's it?
Ed,</b> That's it. Now please leave.
Jesse,</b> You are going to <i>jack me up...</i> over a measly eighteen hundred?!
Ed,"</b> I've got to reopen. The longer you stick around here, the more you jeopardize yourself."
Jesse,"</b> No-- Hey! No, hey. Have you been watching the news?"
Ed,"</b> I have, very much so."
Jesse,</b> So you hear what they've been saying about me. Yeah?
Ed,</b> Yeah.
Jesse,"</b> Look, these people... They have kept me in a concrete hole. Look, I don't even know what <i>month</i> it is! They made me watch when they-- When they shot someone I--"
Ed,"</b> If you believe that you can pull on people's heartstrings, you should take your chances with the police. From where I sit, you made your own luck. As did your former partner. As did your lawyer. You said it yourself, a deal's a deal."
Jesse,</b> No. I am not. Going anywhere. I am staying right here until you help me.
Jesse,</b> What are you doing?
Ed,"</b> Hi, yes. There's a young man in my store and he refuses to leave."
Jesse,</b> Hey. Stop--
Ed,"</b> I-- Yeah, he might be armed."
Jesse,"</b> Stop, hey--!"
Ed,"</b> Uh, not overtly, but, uh, yes, I'm beginning to feel threatened."
Jesse,</b> Are you serious right now?!
Ed,"</b> Uh, yes, my name is Ed Galibraith, I own Best Quality Vaccum, 2714 4th Street. Northwest, that's correct. I... would appreciate it very much if you sent someone immediately."
Jesse,"</b> You... are so full of crap. You didn't call anybody just now! You faked it. And you wanna know how I know? You got as much to lose as I do. More! Way more! When your ""cops"" get here and they bust me, first question they're gonna ask is what am I doing here, trying to hand over a hefty bag full of cash to a dude runs a vacuum cleaner store? What comes out then, huh?! Oh, and uh, you wanna know what else is bullshit? Y'know, like, word to the wise, next time you try to pull this shit on someone, you don't just hang up on a 911 call. They won't let you! Because the lady, or dude, or whoever, is like ""Stay on the line with me, sir! Stay on the line until the officers arrive."" And if you <i>did</i> hang up, they'd call you back immediately. But hey! Guess what? Seriously, yo! Pathetic."
Ed,"</b> Wow, you love that response time."
Ed,</b> Take your money.
Ed,"</b> Officers, thank you very much for getting here so fast; he obviously heard my call--"
Ed,"</b> No, he's not, he's gone, I, uh-- He... was spooked by my phone call and he headed up northbound, uh, on foot, maybe 30 seconds ago."
Ed,"</b> Uh, sure I can! He was, uh, young. Uh, he was white. Skinny. Very tall guy, six-five? Six-six. Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow, interesting -- A large insect."
Ed,"</b> Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?"
Jesse,</b> A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?
Ed,</b> ...it is.
Jesse,</b> I'll get you your money.
Diane,</b> Hello.
Jesse,"</b> Hey, Mom."
Diane,</b> Jesse... It's Jesse!
Adam,</b> G-- Gimme-- Give me the phone! Jesse! Is that you.
Jesse,"</b> Hey, Dad, yeah, it's me. How are the both of you doing?"
Adam,</b> We've been better.
Jesse,</b> Yeah. How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?
Adam,"</b> Jake's on a band trip to London, thank God, Jesse--"
Diane and Adam,"</b> Jesse, where are you?!"
Jesse,</b> I heard you saying that I should turn myself in.
Diane,</b> Yes! It's the right thing to do. Quit running and get some help!
Adam,"</b> No one is trying to hurt you, son! Better you come forward on your own, it'll be safer for you, better all around!"
Jesse,"</b> Do you remember where we used to have those picnics all those years ago, by the little lake? The one with all the ducks?"
Adam,</b> Yeah?
Jesse,"</b> Do you think you guys could come get me, maybe?"
Adam,</b> We're on our way.
Jesse,"</b> Hey, and, uh... It's probably too late to say this. I don't know if it'll mean much to you... But you did your best. And whatever happens with me, it's on me, okay? Nobody else."
Neil,</b> Alright. Done
Kenny,"</b> Bullshit, you're done. You been here twenty minutes, what'd you do?"
Neil,</b> Added a fishplate up here... Welded a metal one down at the end.
Kenny,</b> Added a what?
Neil,</b> Fishplate.
Kenny,"</b> What, like a... plate of fish? The fuck is that, is that even a real word? Look, man, I want more of those things! The... sideway diagonal things, like, twice as many!"
Neil,</b> Those are gussets. You got enough of 'em already.
Kenny,"</b> Okay, yeah, so gussets I got out the ass, but a fishplate I need 'cause, what, I'm Catholic and it's Friday?"
Todd,"</b> You sure you couldn't just put a few more gussets up there, Neil? I mean, what could it hurt, right?"
Neil,"</b> Hey, it's your money, but what I did? You don't even need that. I told you, I built this thing right."
Kenny,"</b> Fuck, bro, I'm not, like, impugning on your precious welding skills... It's just, we have a, uh... Unique situation here. He tried to rabbit on us once already. I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way to break this thing."
Neil,</b> You kidding me? Him?
Kenny,"</b> Yeah, it's just-- I kinda feel it flexing a little bit. A bit right here. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, see? Right there! Yeah, a little bit."
Neil,"</b> Mm, I don't see jack shit flexing. That's four inch chain iron up there. You can hang an F-150 right there and shove it back and forth like a beach ball. It's going nowhere."
Kenny,"</b> Okay, you and your big four inches. It's just, this little bastard's wiry."
Neil,</b> I don't care how wiry he is. He'll knock himself out.
Kenny,"</b> Oh, yeah? Wanna put your money where your mouth is? Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing right here, right now. Fifty plus... Then you gotta put up more of those, uh, whatcha call 'em? Gussets? No charge. Throw in some fish plates, too, while you're at it."
Neil,</b> You're on.
Kenny,"</b> I'm on, huh?"
Neil,</b> Mm-hm.
Kenny,"</b> Alright, alright, get that shit out the way, watch this. <i>[He turns to Jesse.]</i> Alright, good looking. This is it! This is the Acid Test. Go for it. <i>NOW!</i>"
Kenny,"</b> Go, go, go! Faster, hit it hard!"
Kenny,"</b> Alright, alright, other way, other way. Hey, what are you slowing down for? What are you slowing down for?! HIT IT! Alright, c'mon, get up, I got fifty buck riding on ya, I gotta eat this month!"
Todd,"</b> Kenny, if he breaks his leg, he's not gonna be able to cook."
Kenny,"</b> What are you, the fuckin' HR Department? Jesus, Toddy, relax. Gonna even up the odds a little bit, alright! Okay... I believe in you! You gonna John Henry this bitch, yeah? Now go. Go, go, go, let's go! Go, go, go, go, go! Yeah! Alright, back the other way, hit it hard! HARD! YEAH! Caught some air... YEAH!"
Neil,"</b> Todd, who is this guy, anyway? What'd he do?"
Todd,"</b> Eh, it's a-- It's a long story."
Kenny,</b> He's a rat. That's all you need to know.
Neil,</b> What's up?
Jesse,</b> I need more money.
Neil,"</b> Oh, yeah?"
Jesse,</b> That three way split didn't quite cover it for me. I'd appreciate you helping me out.
Casey,"</b> Well, what's he talking about, ""three way split""?! You mean there was a <i>third more?!</i> And you gave it to him?!"
Neil,</b> It's a long story.
Casey,"</b> Wh-- What ""long story""?! When I left, he didn't even have a fucking gun!"
Neil,"</b> Well, he's got one now, doesn't he? So, y'know, shut up. Let me handle this."
Neil,"</b> ""Shut up"" means everybody. Now... How, exactly, do you plan on pulling this off? I mean, being that there's five of us and one of you?"
Jesse,</b> I'm not here to rob you.
Neil,"</b> Oh, you're not? Then how's this work?"
Jesse,"</b> All I need is 1,800. I'm asking as a... a favor."
Casey,"</b> Oh, what, like charity? Seems to me this silly son of a bitch already forked over, big time!"
Neil,"</b> Casey. Seriously, shut up. 1,800, huh? Why not an even 2 grand? Y'know, nice, round number."
Jesse,"</b> 1,800's all I need."
Neil,"</b> So, what's the gun for? Is it-- Is it, like, personal protection? I mean, is-- Is that a--? What is that? Let me see that thing, show me. Oh, my god, is that a .22? You brought a .22?! Jesus! Where'd you even get that thing?"
Jesse,</b> I think it was my grandfather's.
Neil,"</b> Aw, well, that's adorable. I think we got a couple empty beer cans around here, if you wanna do some plinkin'?"
Jesse,"</b> 1,800. I'm gone forever. It's as simple as that."
Casey,"</b> Neil, I swear to God, if you give this piece of shit one more dollar--"
Neil,</b> Cold out here!
Neil,</b> Tell you what... my third is in a duffel bag on the top drawer of that file cabinet. Where's yours?
Jesse,</b> In my car. Parked up the street.
Neil,</b> What do you say... Your .22 against my .45? Winner takes all.
Jesse,</b> Like the Wild West?
Neil,</b> Yeah. Like the Wild West.
Casey,</b> What? Come on--! Uh--
Casey,"</b> Jesus, Neil! C'mon, man, I didn't mean this--!"
Neil,</b> Casey. Shut. The fuck up.
Neil,</b> You ready?
Jesse,</b> Yeah.

Jesse,</b> Go. Go!
Kyle,"</b> Dude, you're on fire."
Jesse,"</b> Of course I miss you... Yeah? Well... Do you miss me? I dunno... Are you, um... How are you gonna convince me?"
Jesse,"</b> Yeah, bitch!"
Jesse,</b> Ah.

Waiter,"</b> Sorry, I can't really do that."
Jesse,"</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait."
Jesse,</b> Sure you can.
Walt,</b> Wow. It's like I'm here with Sinatra.
Jesse,"</b> I know, right?"
Walt,</b> ...certainly went big with the pineapple.
Jesse,</b> What kinda asshole doesn't like pineapple? I'm guessing you don't?
Walt,</b> I could take it or leave it.
Jesse,</b> Pineapple's good for you! It's got Bromine.
Walt,"</b> Bromaline. But, close. Actually, it's not close at all."
Jesse,</b> Are you gonna eat? You should really eat something.
Walt,"</b> No, I'm-- I'm eating. I'll-- I'll eat."
Jesse,"</b> You gotta eat, you gotta hydrate... Get all those electrolytes you were talking about? Your sodium, y'know? All that shit. Hm?"

Walt,</b> I'm fine! Good! Sit down!
Walt,</b> How long will it take to sell this batch?
Jesse,</b> Six months.
Walt,"</b>  ""Six""--?"
Jesse,"</b> Easy, maybe more."
Walt,"</b> There's no one you can think of, who might... buy the entire amount?"
Jesse,"</b> Uh, someone with a spare 1.3 million dollars lying around? No. Can't say that I do. You family is gonna get every dime they got comin' to 'em, Mr. White. No matter how long it takes. Hydrate. Seriously."
Walt,"</b> Yeah. What about you, Jesse? Hm?"
Jesse,</b> Huh?
Walt,"</b> After this, what then?"

Walt,"</b> No, what is stopping you from going to college?"
Jesse,"</b> Um... nothing, I guess."
Walt,"</b> Yeah, nothing at all! Say you went to college."

Jesse,"</b> Well, yeah."
Walt,"</b> And with a business degeree? I mean, that's handy <i>anywhere</i>."
Jesse,"</b> Yeah. Yeah, I... I guess that could be cool."
Walt,"</b> Yeah. You could do it, too. First step, get your GED, that's not a problem..."
Jesse,</b> What do I need a GED for? I got my diploma.
Walt,"</b> Oh. Oh, of course, yeah, right, right, right, right, right."
Jesse,</b> Yo. You were standing right on stage when they handed it to me.
Walt,"</b> Yeah, I know, it just slipped my mind..."
Jesse,"</b> I totally graduated, high school, dick! No thanks to you!"
Walt,"</b> We just-- can we just stay on the subject here? Alright? Alright, the larger point being... Y'know what? Forget it, I don't have a larger point, I'm just making conversation."
Jesse,</b> Yeah.
Walt,"</b> You're really lucky, you know that? You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special..."

Ed,"</b> Not many of us get the chance to start fresh. Good luck, Mister Driscoll."
Jesse,"</b> I was thinking about that thing you said, about the universe. Going where the universe takes you? Right on! I think it's a cool philosophy."
Jane,"</b> I was being metaphorical, it's a terrible philosophy. I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life. It's better to make those decisions for yourself."

Jesse,"</b> Alright, 20 minutes. Sorry. "
Jesse,</b> What?
Jane,"</b> So, exactly how much did you hate that today?"
Jesse,"</b> I didn't, like, <i>hate</i> it."

Peddler," Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. (<i>Camera zooms in hitting peddler in face</i>) Too close. A little too close. (<i>Pulls his face just a little further from the camera</i>) There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, (<i>Opens the pouch on his camel which transforms into a bazaar stall)</i> and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Heh, heh. Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. (<i>taps it on table</i>) will not… (<i>it falls apart</i>) It broke. Ohh! Look at this. (<i>Pulls out Tupperware</i>) I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. (<i>Pries it open, makes raspberry sound.</i>) Ah, still good. (<i>Camera begins to pan to right. The peddler hurries to catch it.</i>) Wait, don’t go! (<i>Stop pan.</i>) I can see that you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. (<i>The peddler pulls the iconic magic lamp out from his sleeve.</i>) Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. (<i>Another pan, this one slower to left. Again, the peddler rushes to catch up.</i>) This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of a young man’s life. A young man who, liked this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?

Aladdin, [sighs] Here. Go on. Take it.

Abu," Ah, don’t. Huh?"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people. He sees </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">alley. The BOY runs out in front of the ACHMED’s horse, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">startling it.)</span>"
ACHMED," Out of my way, you filthy brat!"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">jumps in front of them and catches the whip.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Hey, if I were as rich as you, I could afford some manners!"
ACHMED, Oh--I teach you some manners!
ALADDIN," Look at that, Abu. It’s not every day you see a <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">horse with two rear ends!</span>"
ACHMED," Oh! You are a worthless street rat! You were born a <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">street rat, you’ll die a street rat, and only </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">your fleas will mourn you.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">in his face.)</span>"
ALADDIN," I’m not worthless. And I don’t have fleas. Come <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">on, Abu. Let’s go home.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">ABU for the night.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Riffraff, street rat. <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">I don’t buy that. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">If only they’d look closer </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Would they see a poor boy? No siree. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">They’d find out, there’s so much more to me.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">Someday, Abu, things are gonna change. We’ll be </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">at all.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">rear end of his pants.)</span>"
ACHMED, I’ve never been so insulted.
SULTAN," Oh, Prince Achmed. You’re not leaving so soon, are <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">you?</span>"
ACHMED, Good luck marrying her off.
SULTAN," Oh, Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN goes <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">off into the garden looking for his daughter. He </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">finds her, but is interrupted by RAJAH, JASMINE’s </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">pet tiger, who blocks him off. RAJAH has a piece </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">of PRINCE ACHMED’s undershorts in his mouth. The SULTAN </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">grabs the cloth and yanks it out of RAJAH’s mouth.) </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Confound it, Rajah! So, this is why Prince Achmed </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">stormed out!</span>"
JASMINE," Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him,<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> weren’t you Rajah. (RAJAH comes over and allows</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> JASMINE to pet and hug him.) You were just playing</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> with that overdressed, self-absorbed Prince Achmed,</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> weren’t you? (She cuddles with RAJAH, enjoying the</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> moment, until she looks up at her angry father.)</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> Ahem.</span>"
SULTAN," Dearest, you’ve got to stop rejecting every suitor <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">that comes to call. The law says you…</span>"
BOTH, …must be married to a prince.
SULTAN, By your next birthday.
JASMINE, The law is wrong.
SULTAN, You’ve only got three more days!
JASMINE," Father, I hate being forced into this. (She takes <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">I want it to be for love.</span>"
SULTAN," Jasmine, it’s not only this law. (She hands him<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I’m not</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> going to be around forever, and I just want to make </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">sure you’re taken care of, provided for.</span>"
JASMINE," Please try to understand. I’ve never done a thing on my own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish.) I’ve never had any real friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.) I’ve never even been outside the palace walls."
SULTAN," But Jasmine, you’re a princess."
JASMINE," Then maybe I don’t want to be a princess anymore. (She <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">splashes the water.)</span>"
SULTAN," Oooohhh! Allah forbid you should have any <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">daughters!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">cage and yanks open the door. The birds fly off into freedom. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">She watches them go. Cut to int. of SULTAN’s chambers.)</span>"
SULTAN," I don’t know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn’t nearly so picky. (A shadow falls over him. He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh. Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom."
JAFAR," My life is but to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)"
SULTAN," It’s this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">choose a husband. I’m at my wit’s-end.</span>"
IAGO, (In the parrot voice) Awk! Wit’s-end.
SULTAN," Oh, ha ha. Have a cracker, pretty Polly! (He pulls a cracker out from his pocket. IAGO looks terrified. Then the SULTAN stuffs it in Iago's mouth. IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.)"
JAFAR," Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">(IAGO glares at him.) Now then, perhaps I can </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">divine a solution to this thorny problem.</span>"
SULTAN," If anyone can help, it’s you."
JAFAR," Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">diamond.</span>"
SULTAN," Uh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">years.</span>"
JAFAR," It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. (JAFAR says the word ‘princess’ with the accent on the second syllable, ""cess."" He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR’s voice slows down and deepens. The SULTAN’s eyes get a hypnotized look.) Don’t worry. Everything will be fine."
SULTAN, Everything…will be…fine.
JAFAR, The diamond.
SULTAN," Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine."
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)</span>"
JAFAR," You are most gracious, my liege. Now run along and <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">play with your little toys.</span>"
SULTAN, (Still hypnotized) Yes…that’ll be…pretty good.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">the parrot spits out the cracker.)</span>"
IAGO," I can’t take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers…bam! </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Whack!</span>"
JAFAR," Calm yourself, Iago."
IAGO, Then I’d grab him around the head. Whack! Whack!
JAFAR," (Speaking over IAGO.) Soon, I will be sultan, not <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">that addlepated twit.</span>"
IAGO," And then I stuff the crackers down his throat! Ha <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">ha!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);""> at night. A shadowy figure walks through. We see it is JASMINE</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> in disguise. She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it.</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.)</span>"
JASMINE," Oh, I’m sorry, Rajah. But I can’t stay here and<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> have my life lived for me. I’ll miss you. (She</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH,</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> who begins to whine and whimper.) Good bye!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">and ABU are up to their capers again. They are on top of the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">awning of a fruit stand.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Okay, Abu. Go!"
PROPRIETOR," (To passing crowd) Try this, your taste buds <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">hangs there, distracting his attention.) Hey, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">get your paws off that.</span>"
ABU, Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR," Why, you. Get away from here, you filthy ape."
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)</span>"
ABU, Bye bye.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">where he places it on top of a stack. He looks confused, like </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">he has just done this.)</span>"
ALADDIN, Nice goin’ Abu. Breakfast is served.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">ASMINE walking through the street.)</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">or silver.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">dates and pistachios!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">necklace for a pretty lady.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">into her face.)</span>"
JASMINE," I don’t think so. (She backs away, but bumps into <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">fire.) Oh, excuse me. (He gulps, then belches </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">fire from his mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. He is </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">pleased and taps his stomach. ALADDIN sees her, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">and a strange look comes over his face.) I’m </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">really very sorry.</span>"
ALADDIN, (He’s obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN’s </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">face.)</span>"
ABU, Uh oh. Hello? Hello?
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">reaching for a piece of fruit. She picks one up and gives it to </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">him.)</span>"
JASMINE," Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go. (The <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">boy runs off.)</span>"
PROPRIETOR, You’d better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE, (Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR, No one steals from my cart.
JASMINE," Oh, I’m sorry sir. I don’t have any money."
PROPRIETOR, Thief.
JASMINE," Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">get some from the Sultan.</span>"
PROPRIETOR, Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">chop it off.)</span>"
JASMINE," No, no please."
ALADDIN," Thank you kind sir. I’m so glad you’ve found <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">her. I’ve been looking all over for you.</span>"
JASMINE, (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN, (whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR, You know this girl?
ALADDIN," Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She’s a little <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">crazy. (He circles his finger around his ear. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">She is shocked. The PROPRIETOR grabs him by </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">the vest.)</span>"
PROPRIETOR, She said she knows the Sultan.
ALADDIN, She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)</span>"
JASMINE," Oh, wise Sultan. How may I serve you?"
ABU," Well, blah blah blah blah."
ALADDIN," Tragic, isn’t it? (He leans forward, picking<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> up another apple from the cart with his</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> foot.) But, no harm done. (Walks over to</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> Jasmine.) Now come along sis. Time to see the</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> doctor.</span>"
JASMINE," (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">How are you?</span>"
ALADDIN," No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">out.)</span>"
PROPRIETOR," Huh? What is it? (ABU picks up what he can <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">you little thieves!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">contraption. At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)</span>"
IAGO," (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, Your <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Rottenness, couldn’t we just wait for a real storm?</span>"
JAFAR," Save your breath, Iago. Faster. (He places the <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">SULTAN’s ring in the contraption.)</span>"
IAGO," Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]"
JAFAR," Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">enter the cave. (The sand in top forms the Cave of </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Wonders. It falls through into a storm, but it </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes... Yes! </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">There he is. My diamond in the rough.</span>"
IAGO," That’s him? That’s the clown we’ve been <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">waitin’ for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">into the gears.)</span>"
JAFAR," Let’s have the guards extend him an invitation to <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">the palace, shall we?</span>"
IAGO, Swell. [coughs]
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">ALADDIN in it. Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)</span>"
ALADDIN, Almost there.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">She stands up.)</span>"
JASMINE, I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN," Uh, forget it. (He grabs a pole.) So, uh, this is <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">your first time in the marketplace, huh?</span>"
JASMINE, Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN," Well, you do kinda stand out. (He stares at her, <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">still in love. She returns the look. But he </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">I mean, uh, you don’t seem to know how dangerous </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">down, she vaults over his head. He looks back in </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">surprise. She tosses the pole to him. Both </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">ALADDIN’s and ABU’s eyes bulge.)</span>"
JASMINE, I’m a fast learner.
ALADDIN," Right. C’mon, this way. (They go inside the roof <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">of a building, dodging planks and beams as they </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">go.) Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.</span>"
JASMINE, Is this where you live?
ALADDIN, Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.
JASMINE, Fabulous.
ALADDIN," Well, it’s not much, (he pulls back the curtain and <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">exposes the palace) but it’s got a great view. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?</span>"
JASMINE," Oh, it’s wonderful."
ALADDIN," I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets…"
JASMINE," Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress."
ALADDIN, It’s better than here. Always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
JASMINE, You’re not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN, Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE, You’re just--
BOTH, (in unison) --trapped.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">another. But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">look. He takes the apple out of ABU’s hand and rolls it down his </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">arm into the hand of JASMINE.)</span>"
ALADDIN," So, uh, where’re you from?"
JASMINE," What does it matter? I ran away, and I am not going back."
ALADDIN," Really? How come? (He takes a bite from the apple in his <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">look on his face.)</span>"
ABU, Why you...!
JASMINE, My father’s forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN," That’s--that’s awful. (ABU appears from behind the <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!</span>"
JASMINE, What?
ALADDIN, Abu says that--uh--that’s not fair.
ABU, What?
JASMINE, Oh did he?
ALADDIN," Yeah, of course."
JASMINE, And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN," Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">to help.</span>"
ABU," Oh, boy!"
JASMINE, Hmm... tell him that’s very... sweet.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">ALADDIN leans in to kiss her. He is interrupted, however, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">by the GUARDS, who have found them.)</span>"
GUARD, Here you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE," They’re after me! (To each other) They’re <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">after you?</span>"
JASMINE, My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN, Do you trust me?
JASMINE, What?
ALADDIN, Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE, Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN, Then jump!
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)</span>"
GUARD," We just keep running into each other, don’t we, <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">street rat?</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">here and block the exit. The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">throws him in a vase. Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)</span>"
GUARD," It’s the dungeon for you, boy."
ALADDIN," Hey, get off of me!"
JASMINE, Let go of him.
GUARD," (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">have here, men--a street mouse. (He throws her </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">down.)</span>"
JASMINE," (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Unhand him, by order of the princess!</span>"
GUARD, Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN, The princess?
ABU, (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD," What are you doing outside the palace? And with <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">this street rat?</span>"
JASMINE," That’s not your concern. Do as I command. Release <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">him!</span>"
GUARD," Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Jafar. You’ll have to take it up with him.</span>"
JASMINE," (getting a very fed-up look) Believe me, I will."

JASMINE, Jafar?
JAFAR," Oh, uh, princess."
IAGO," Awk! Jafar, I’m stuck!"
JAFAR," How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his cape, hiding the door.)"
JASMINE," The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders."
JAFAR, Your father’s charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE, What was the crime?
IAGO," I can’t breathe, Jafar."
JAFAR," Why, kidnapping the princess, of course."
IAGO," If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!"
JASMINE, He didn’t kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR," (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear! Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known."
JASMINE, What do you mean?
JAFAR," Sadly, the boy’s sentence has already been carried out."
JASMINE, What sentence?
JAFAR, (with a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE gasps.) By beheading.
JASMINE, No! (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR," I am exceedingly sorry, princess."
JASMINE, How could you? (She runs from the room crying.)
IAGO," So, how did it go?"
JAFAR, I think she took it... rather well. (They both get a sinister smile on their faces.)
JASMINE," It’s all my fault, Rajah. I didn’t even know his name."
ALADDIN, (to himself) She was the princess. I can’t believe it. I must have sounded so stupid to her!
ABU, (from a distance) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Hello!
ALADDIN," Abu! Down here! Hey, c’mon--help me outta these."

ABU," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
ALADDIN," Don’t worry, Abu. I’ll never see her again. I’m a <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">street rat, remember, and there’s a law. She’s </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince.</span>"
ABU, Ta-da!
ALADDIN, (Rubbing his wrists) I’m a… I’m a fool.
OLD MAN," You’re only a fool if you give up, boy."

ALADDIN, Who are you?
OLD MAN," A lowly prisoner like yourself. But together, <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">perhaps we can be more.</span>"
ALADDIN, I’m listening.
OLD MAN," There is a cave, boy... a Cave of Wonders, filled <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I’d </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">wager.</span>"

The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">his head out of JAFAR’s ""old man"" disguise.)</span>"
IAGO," Jafar, can ya hurry up? I’m dyin’ in here. [squawking]"
ALADDIN, But the law says that only a prince can…
OLD MAN," You’ve heard of the golden rule, haven’t you?<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He grins, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">showing a hideously bad mouth.) [wheezing laugh]</span>"
ALADDIN," So why would you share all this wonderful <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">treasure with me?</span>"
OLD MAN," I need a young pair of legs and a strong <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">back to go in after it.</span>"
ALADDIN," Uh, one problem. It’s out there. We’re in here."
OLD MAN," Mm-mm-mm. Things aren’t always what they <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">seem. So… do we have a deal?</span>"
ABU," Oh, I don’t know."
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">OLD MAN and ABU on it. Diss. to Cave of Wonders.)</span>"

CAVE, Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp.

OLD MAN," Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">you shall have your reward.</span>"
ALADDIN," Come on, Abu. (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">his vest.)</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)</span>"
ALADDIN, Would you look at that?
ABU, [whimpering] Uh oh.
ALADDIN," Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">than the Sultan.</span>"
ALADDIN, Abu.
ALADDIN, Don’t… touch… anything. We gotta find that lamp.
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">off the floor and begins following them. ABU gets the feeling </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">they’re being followed.)</span>"
ABU, Huh?
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">the CARPET begins to follow again. Again, ABU turns back, but the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)</span>"
ABU," Aladdin, Aladdin."
ALADDIN," Abu, will you knock it off?"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">jumps to the other side. It reaches down with a tassel and pulls </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">ABU’s tail. When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">side. This time, ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET reaches </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">down and plucks ABU’s hat off, then puts it on himself. ABU sits </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">face. ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away. ABU tackles </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Abu, what are you, crazy?"
ALADDIN," A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. I'm not gonna <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">hurt you.</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">it off. It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">him. ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN’s shoulder.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Hey, take it easy, Abu. He’s not gonna bite. Thanks."
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">his fist and screeches at it. CARPET begins to walk away, ""sadly."")</span>"
ALADDIN," Hey. Wait a minute. Don’t go. Maybe you can help <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">us. (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">over and wraps around the pair.) Hey, whoa. You </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">see, we’re trying to find this lamp. (CARPET </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">motions for them to follow it.) I think he knows </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">where it is.</span>"
ABU, [squeaks excitedly] [echoes]
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">underground cavern. In the center of the room is a tall pillar, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">with a staircase going up to it. It is surrounded by water </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge. At the top of </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)</span>"
ALADDIN, [whispers] Wait here.
ABU, [moaning] Oh. Huh? Oh!
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">giant ruby. ABU is hypnotically drawn to it. ALADDIN climbs the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">stairs quickly. CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">to hold him back. ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)</span>"
ALADDIN," This is it? This is what we came all the way down <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">here to… (He looks down and sees ABU break free </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">of CARPET’s hold and lunge toward the jewel.) Abu! No</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">w</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">!</span>"

CAVE VOICE, Infidels!
ABU, Uh oh.
CAVE VOICE," You have touched the forbidden treasure! (ABU <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">and the shrine melt into lava.)

ALADDIN, Whoa!
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">skies down until he flies into the air. The water has turned into </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">lava. He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">and catches him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">is exploding.)</span>"
ABU," Help, help, help!"
ALADDIN," Gotcha! Whoa, Carpet, let’s move!"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN’s head and covers his eyes.)</span>"
ALADDIN," Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic! (He pulls ABU off <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">Start panicking!</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">emerge through the internal entrance. Outside, the cave begins to </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">growl and close. CARPET and company are almost to the top when a </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">boulder drops on carpet, with a clip of THX Optimizer, sending it to the floor. ALADDIN grabs </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">onto the rock wall and holds on. He sees the OLD MAN at the top, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">within reach.)</span>"
ALADDIN, Help me out!
OLD MAN, Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN, I can’t hold on. Give me your hand!
OLD MAN, First give me the lamp!
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)</span>"
OLD MAN, [laughing] Yes! At last! [puts the lamp in]
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN’s wrist.)</span>"
ALADDIN, What are you doing?
OLD MAN," Giving you your reward! (JAFAR returns to his<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> normal voice.) Your eternal reward. [screaming]</span>"
color,"rgb(242,242,242);"">ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">who falls into the cave. OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> well. The clip ends from THX Optimizer, falling down. CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> boulder. It struggles to break free, then does. It races</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> times, and is unconscious. On the surface, the cave roars one</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> final time, then sinks back into the sand. JAFAR pulls off</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> his disguise.) [yelling]</span>"
JAFAR," It’s mine! It’s all mine! I-- (He can’t <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">find it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!</span>"

ABU," Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin."
ALADDIN," Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">We’re trapped.

ABU, Aha!
ALADDIN," Heh! Why, you hairy little thief! Looks like such a <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">beat-up, worthless piece of junk.

ALADDIN," Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin."
GENIE," (Says his name as if he’s discovered something <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">major) Aladdin!

JAFAR, (He looks at IAGO in insult) What?
IAGO," Okay, you marry the princess, all right? Then, uh, <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">you become sultan!</span>"
JAFAR," Oh! Marry the shrew? I become sultan. The idea has<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> merit!</span>"
IAGO," Yes, merit! Yes! And then we drop papa-in-law and<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> the little woman off a cliff! (Dive bombs into the </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">floor) Kersplat!</span>"

ALADDIN," Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> cave. You did that on your own.</span>"

GENIE," Well, don’t I feel just sheepish? All right, you <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">baaaaad boy, but no more freebies.</span>"
ALADDIN," Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> good. (To GENIE) What would you wish for?</span>"
GENIE," Me? No one’s ever asked me that before. Well, in<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> my case, ah, forget it.</span>"
ALADDIN," What? No, tell me."
GENIE, Freedom.
ALADDIN, You’re a prisoner?

To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about, here? Let’s get real here. It’s not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and  smell the hummus."
ALADDIN, Why not?
GENIE," The only way I get outta this is if my master <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">wishes me out. So you can guess how often that’s </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">happened.</span>"
ALADDIN, I’ll do it. I’ll set you free.
GENIE," (Head turns into Pinocchio’s with a long nose) Uh <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">huh, right. Whoop!</span>"
ALADDIN," No, really, I promise. (He pushes the nose back in <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">and Genie’s head returns to normal.)

(Turns into a</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> magician.) So how ‘bout it. What is it you want </span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">most?</span>"
ALADDIN," Well, there’s this girl."
GENIE," Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and Genie's chest shows a<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> heart with a cross through it.) Wrong. I can’t</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> make anybody fall in love, remember?</span>"
ALADDIN," Oh, but, Genie, she’s smart and fun and…"
GENIE, Pretty?
ALADDIN," Beautiful. She’s got these eyes that just… and<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> this hair. Wow. And her smile… [sighs]</span>"

GENIE," Let’s see here. (Has a ""Royal Cookbook"".) Chicken à la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head) Nope. Alaskan king crab.

Caesar’s salad? Ah! (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) <i>Et Tu,</i> Brute? No. Aha. ""To make a prince."" (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.) Is that an official wish? Say the words."
ALADDIN," Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!"
GENIE," All right! Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.) First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar? No! Let’s work with me here. (He takes Aladdin's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.) I like it, muy macho! Now, still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy! Aqui, over here!"
ABU, Uh oh!
GENIE," Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with ""AL"" on it.) And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel! Watch out, it spits! (A door bearing the Genie's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel. He spits out the side of his mouth on cue. But the Genie’s not sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough. Let’s see. What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a ‘57 Cadillac, with license plate ""ABU 1."" (That one’s a guess, I don’t know cars, but judging by the tail fins, ‘nuff said.) Finally, he’s returned to normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, shimin <a href=""/wiki/Dumbo"" title=""Dumbo"">dumbo</a>! Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, <a href=""/wiki/Dumbo"" title=""Dumbo"">Dumbo</a>, ABU turns into an elephant. CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU’s size 46 feet.)

JAFAR," Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">your daughter.</span>"
IAGO, Awk! The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN," Oh, really?"
JAFAR," (Unrolling a scroll) Right here. ""If the princess<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> then the sultan shall choose for her.""</span>"

JASMINE," (She looks at him thinking as she has seen him before.) Wait, wait. Do I know you?"
ALADDIN," (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no."
JASMINE, You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.
ALADDIN," The marketplace? (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn’t have been me you met."
JASMINE," (She looks disappointed) No, I guess not."
BEE," (It’s the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her! She’s smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature!"
ALADDIN," Um, Princess Jasmine? You’re very…"
BEE," Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!"
ALADDIN, Punctual!
JASMINE, Punctual?
BEE, Sorry.
ALADDIN, Beautiful.
BEE, Nice recovery.
JASMINE," Hmm. I’m rich too, you know."
ALADDIN, Yeah!
JASMINE, The daughter of a sultan.
ALADDIN, I know.
JASMINE, A fine prize for any prince to marry.
ALADDIN," Uh, right. Right. A prince like me."
BEE, (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE," Right, a prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering, peacock I’ve met!"
BEE," (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday!"
JASMINE, Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
ALADDIN, What?
BEE, Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN, (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE," Okay, fine. But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban)"
ALADDIN," Yeah, right!"
JASMINE, What!?
ALADDIN," Uh, you’re right. You aren’t just some prize to be won, (He looks disappointed.) You should be free to make your own choice. (Personal Slave Girl JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I’ll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.)"
JASMINE, No!
ALADDIN, (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What? What?
JASMINE, (Now she’s amazed) How--how are you doing that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN, It’s a magic carpet.
JASMINE, It’s lovely. (CARPET takes Jasmine's hand with a tassel.)
ALADDIN," You, uh, you don’t want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world."
JASMINE, Is it safe?
ALADDIN, Sure. Do you trust me?
JASMINE, (She looks at him at the saying of that all-important line) What?

ALADDIN," No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!"
JASMINE," Good luck! (She pushes him out onto the platform<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire</span><span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> crowd.)</span>"
SULTAN, …Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN," Oh, boy!"
IAGO," Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak."
JAFAR," Let them cheer. <span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"">(He lifts the lamp and rubs it. GENIE comes out.)</span>"

JAFAR," I am your master now. (He throws GENIE to the<span style=""background-color:rgb(242,242,242);""> ground and puts his foot on GENIE’s face.)</span>"
GENIE, I was afraid of that.

JAFAR, Heh heh heh!
SULTAN," Jafar, you vile betrayer."
IAGO, That’s Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
ALADDIN," Oh, yeah? Well, we’ll just see about that! (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty) The lamp!"
JAFAR," Finders-keepers, Abooboo."
ALADDIN, Genie! No!
GENIE," Sorry, kid--I got a new master now. (He places the palace on top of a mountain.)"
SULTAN," Jafar, I order you to stop!"
JAFAR," There’s a new order now--my order! Finally, you will bow to me!"
JAFAR, We will never bow to you!
IAGO, Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR," If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer! (To GENIE) Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!"

JASMINE," Stop it! Jafar, leave him alone!"
JAFAR," It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen…"
JASMINE, Never!
JAFAR, I’ll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her. Then he stops.) No. Genie... I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
GENIE," (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo-"
JAFAR," Don’t talk back to me, you stupid blue lout! You will do what I order you to do... slave!"
JASMINE," (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Hm, I never realized how... incredibly handsome you are."
JAFAR," That’s better. (He pulls the GENIE’s jaw up like a shade.) Now... pussycat, tell me more about…myself."
JASMINE, You’re... tall... and dark...
JAFAR, Yes?
JASMINE, Well dressed…

JAFAR," That was--(he sees ALADDIN’s reflection in her crown.) You! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?!"
ALADDIN, Get the lamp!
JAFAR," Now! Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!"
ALADDIN, Jasmine!
IAGO," Ooh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)"
JAFAR, Don’t toy with me! (He’s zapped into a toy monkey.)
ALADDIN, Abu!
JAFAR," Things are unraveling fast now, boy! (JAFAR laughs as CARPET is zapped and unravels. ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.) Get the point? (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor. JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I’m just getting warmed up! (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)"
ALADDIN," Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?!"
JAFAR," A snake, am I? Perhaps you’d like to see how… snake-like I can be! (He smiles broadly, and we see a snake’s tongue come out from behind his teeth. He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN. The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing ‘A’ sweaters.)"
GENIES," Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake!"
JAFAR, You stay out of thissss!
GENIE," (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he’s our man. If he can’t do it, GREAT!"
JASMINE, Aladdin!
ALADDIN," Jasmine, hang on!"
JAFAR, (laughs hideously) You little fool! You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth?!
IAGO," (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him out of the way)"
JAFAR," Without the genie, boy, you’re nothing!"
ALADDIN, (Has an idea) The genie. The genie! The genie has more power than you’ll ever have!
JAFAR, What?!
ALADDIN, He gave you your power! He can take it away!
GENIE," Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?"
ALADDIN," Face it, Jafar! You’re still just... second best!"
JAFAR, You’re right! His power does exceed my own. But not for long...
GENIE, The boy is crazy. He’s a little punch drunk. One too many hits with the snake. (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
JAFAR, Slave! I make my third wish! I wish to be... an all-powerful genie!
GENIE," (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al."
JAFAR, Yes... Yes! The power... The absolute power!
JASMINE, (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN, Trust me!
JAFAR, The universe is mine to command! To control!
ALADDIN," Not so fast, Jafar! Aren’t you forgetting something?"
JAFAR, (looks down questioningly) Huh?
ALADDIN, You wanna be a genie? You got it!
JAFAR, What?!
ALADDIN, And everything that goes with it!
JAFAR, No! NO!!!
IAGO, I’m gettin’ out of here!
ALADDIN, Phenomenal cosmic powers!

Genie,"</b> (Wipes away a tear) Al, no problem. You’ve still got one wish left. Just say the word and you’re a prince again."
Aladdin,"</b> But Genie, what about your freedom?"
Genie," Hey, it’s only an eternity of servitude. This is love. (He leans down next to her.) Al, you’re not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I’ve looked."

Genie,"</b> Me too, Al. No matter what anybody says, you’ll always be a prince to me."

Iago, Here comes the Master.
Jafar, You bring me the rough but never a diamond. Take them away.
Iago, Take them away.
Prisoner," Majazeer, perhaps this diamond in the rough does not exist."
Jafar, He is out there.
Prisoner, But we've searched for months. I do not understand what could possibly be in that cave that could help a man as great as you. You are already second
Iago, Second! Uh-oh. Who's in trouble now?
Jafar, And you think second is enough?
Prisoner, Of course. You were not born to be sultan.
Iago, Not smart.
Jafar, Do you know what I had to do to get the power that I have? The sacrifices that I've made? The bodies that I've buried? The five years spent in a Sherabad jail? People need to understand that they will pay for underestimating me. Second is not enough! And it will never be enough! That's why I need the lamp. And why I no longer need you!
Aladdin, Tea?
Jasmine, Thank you. And thank you for
Aladdin," Uh, you're welcome..."
Jasmine," Um, I'm Dalia."
Aladdin, Dalia.
Aladdin, From the palace.
Jasmine, How could you tell?
Aladdin," Well, only someone from the palace could afford a bracelet like that. And that silk lining is imported, too. It comes from the merchant boats straight to the palace. But not to servants. At least not most servants. Which means you... are a handmaid to the Princess."
Jasmine, Impressive.
Aladdin, You think that's impressive. You should see the city from up there.
Jasmine, Agrabah. It's so beautiful. I should get out more.
Aladdin, You should tell the Princess to get out more. The people haven't seen her in years.
Jasmine," They won't let her. Ever since my... The Queen was killed, the Sultan's been afraid. So she's kept locked away."
Aladdin,Seems everyone's been afraid since then. But the people of Agrabah had nothing to do with that. The people loved her.
Jasmine," They did, didn't they? Is this yours?"
Aladdin, It's kind of... borrowed. My mother taught me that song.
Jasmine, Mine too.
Aladdin, It's all I remember of her.
Jasmine, And what about your father?
Aladdin," I lost them both when I was young. Been on my own ever since. It's all right, it's just..."
Jasmine, What?
Aladdin," It's a little sad... p having a monkey as the only parental authority in your life. We get by. Every day, I just... think things will be different, but it never seems to change. Just sometimes, I feel like I'm..."
Jasmine, Trapped. Like you... can't escape what you were born into?
Aladdin, Yes.
Jasmine, I have to get back to the palace.
Aladdin, Now? It's just another prince coming to court the princess.
Jasmine," Yes, and I have to get her ready. Oh, do you have my bracelet?"
Aladdin," Sure. I'm sure I put it in here. Somewhere. Abu, did you take it?"
Jasmine, That was my mother's bracelet.
Aladdin," Yes, it's beautiful."
Jasmine, You are a thief.
Aladdin," No. No. Yes, but..."
Jasmine, I was so naive. Excuse me.
Aladdin, Wait. Wait. Wait!
Guard," Street rat, get out of the way."
Aladdin, Who do you think you're calling a street rat?
Guard, Are you talking back to me? You were born worthless and you will die worthless. And only your fleas will mourn you.
Aladdin," Come on, Abu. Let's go home."

Sultan," Welcome, Prince Anders. We trust you had an enjoyable journey."
Prince Anders," Oh, wow."
Sultan," Prince Anders, my daughter... Princess Jasmine."
Prince Anders, S-So... Why did no one tell me of your beauty?
Jasmine," No one mentioned yours, either."
Prince Anders," Oh, thank you. They say that in Skinland. Ya, right? It's... It's very, very amusing"
Jasmine, Is it?
Prince Anders, Ya.
Jasmine, We have that same title yet arenever described the same way.
Sultan, Mm-hrm... Jasmine.
Prince Anders, Ya. Oh. What is that? Don't. Don't tell me. It's a cat... with stripes.
Iago, He likes you.
Prince Anders," I know.Cause in Sknland, cats love me. Here, puss-puss. Hey, puss-puss. Hey, puss-puss, puss..."
Jafar," My Sultan... Our enemies grow stronger every day, yet you allow your daughterto dismiss Prince Anders and a possible military alliance. Which enemies? Sherabad continues to amass."
Sultan, Sherabad is our ally.
Jafar, Was our ally.
Sultan, You would drag us into a war with our only...
Jafar, Yet you would allow your
Sultan, Jafar! Remember your place.
Jafar," I apologize. Forgive me, my Sultan. I went too far. But... if you would only reconsider, I think you would see that invading Sherabad is the right thing to do."
Sultan, Invading Sherabad is...
Jasmine, Invade Sherabad? Why would we invade Mother's kingdom?
Sultan, We would never invade Sherabad.
Jafar, But an ally in Sknland would
Sultan, Yes. If you consider giving Prince Anders a chance.
Jasmine," To rule? Baba, Rajah would make a better ruler."
Sultan," My dear, I'm not getting any younger. We must find you a husband and... we are running out of kingdoms."
Jasmine," What foreign prince can care for our people as I do? I could lead, if only..."
Sultan," My dear, you cannot be a sultan. Because it has never been done in the thousand-year history of our kingdom."
Jasmine, I have been preparing for this my whole life. I have read every...
Jafar," Books? But you cannot read experience. Inexperience is dangerous. People, left unchecked, will revolt. Walls and borders, unguarded, will be attacked."
Sultan," Jafar is right. One day, you will understand. You may leave now."
Jafar," Life will be kinder to you, Princess, once you accept these traditions and understand it's better for you to be seen and not heard."

Aladdin," You know what to do, Abu."
Guards, Close the gates!
Iago, Tacky monkey.
Jafar," Remember your place, Jafar."
Iago, Remember your place.
Iago," Sorry, Master."
Jafar, Another petty insult from that slow-minded fool. He sees a city where I see an empire.
Iago, Such vision.
Jafar," Once that lamp sits in my hand, then I shall sit on his throne."
Iago, Thief! Thief in the palace.
Jafar, Thief in the palace?
Iago, That's what I said. Thief.
Jafar," What have you seen, Iago?"
Iago, Diamond in the rough.
Iago, Who's a clever boy?
Jasmine," But Dalia, there has to be something I can do."
Dalia," A handsome prince wants to marry you.vOh, when will life get easier?"
Jasmine," It's not that I don't want to marry, it's just..."
Dalia, You want to be sultan. But why?
Jasmine," You remember my mother used to say, ""We would only ever be as happy as our least happy subject."" If she saw what I saw today,"
Dalia, She would also want you to be safe.
Jasmine, Jafar's guards on every corner. Soon he'd have them
Dalia," If you had to marry a useless prince, you could certainly do worse than this one. He's tall and handsome, and yes, he's a little dim but, you're just getting married. It's not like you have to talk to him. But you'd prefer that"
Jasmine, Can I help you?
Aladdin, Tea?
Jasmine," You.You! What are you doing here? Get in here, now."
Aladdin, I... came back to return your bracelet.
Jasmine, My bracelet? Where is it?
Aladdin, On your wrist.
Jasmine, What?
Aladdin, Not bad! I like what she's done with the place.
Jasmine, How did you get past the guards? 
Aladdin," That was challenging. But, I have my ways. While the Princess is out, would you like to go for a stroll? Have a little chat?"
Jasmine, You're unbelievable. You cannot just break into a palace and walk around like
Aladdin," If you don't have anything, you have to act like"
Jasmine," You did not find it, you stole it."
Aladdin," Correction, the monkey stole it."
Jasmine, He's your monkey.
Aladdin, He's still just a monkey.
Dalia, Who ordered the tea?
Jasmine," Uh... I did. For you, Princess Jasmine."
Aladdin, Your Majesty!
Dalia," Why are you being weird? Oh, I'm... the Princess... Yes! Mm-hmm. And it is good to be me with all my"
Jasmine, She doesn't get out much.
Aladdin, Mm-hmm. Clearly. Aren't you supposed to be in the bath?
Dalia, This cat isn't going to clean itself.
Aladdin, But don't cats clean themselves?
Jasmine, You have to go now.
Aladdin," Oh, okay, but I'm coming back tomorrow night."
Jasmine," What? No, you can't."
Aladdin," Meet me in the courtyard beside the fountain. When the moon is above the minaret. To return this. I promise. Can you believe it, Abu? The most heavily guarded place in all of Agrabah."
Guards, Evening.
Aladdin," Evening. Evening. Guards are behind me. Hello, boys. Where am I?"
Jafar," In a world of trouble, boy."
Aladdin, That bracelet. Is that what this is about? Because I-I didn't steal it. The handmaid...
Jafar, What was a handmaid doing wearing the Queen's bracelet?
Aladdin," The Queen? No, no. She said that - it belonged to..."
Jafar," Her mother. Well, at least she told the truth about one thing."
Aladdin, A-Are you saying that was the Princess? I was talking to the...
Jafar, She was toying with you. It amuses her to meet commoners.Did you actually
Aladdin, Aladdin.
Jafar, Aladdin. People like us must be realistic.
Aladdin, Us?
Jafar," You see, I was once like you. A common thief. Only I thought bigger. Steal an apple, and you're a thief. Steal a kingdom, and you're a statesman. Only weak men stop there. You're either the most powerful man in the room, or you're nothing. You. You stumbled upon an opportunity. I can make you rich. Rich enough to impress a princess. But nothing comes for free."
Aladdin, What would I have to do?
Jafar," There's a cave nearby. And in it, a simple oil lamp. Retrieve it for me, and I will make you wealthy enough to impress a princess. You're nothing to her. But you could be. Your life begins now, Aladdin."
Dalia, Still waiting?
Jasmine," No. No, I... came out to... He promised."
Dalia, I'll be upstairs if you need me.
Jasmine," Good night, Dalia."
Jafar," The Cave of Wonders. When you enter, you will see more riches than you've ever dreamed of. Gold, diamonds... and... the lamp. Bring it to me and I will make you rich and free. But take no other treasure, no matter how sorely you are tempted. And you will be tempted."
Cave of Wonders, Only one may enter here. One who's worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough.
Jafar, Remember... take nothing but the lamp.
Aladdin," Abu, don't touch. Remember? Whoa. Abu. This is a magic carpet. These really do exist. Hello, carpet. Let’s see what we can do about your situation here. Oh, hey! Don't mention it. Abu, keep your little monkey hands to yourself. Abu! No!"
Cave of Wonders," (voice) You have touched the forbidden treasure! Now, you will never again see the light of day!"
Aladdin," Carpet! Abu, jump!"
Aladdin, Could you give me a hand?
Jafar," First, the lamp."
Aladdin," No, no, first, your hand."
Jafar, We don't have much time. Give me the lamp.
Aladdin, Your hand!
Iago," Second no more, Master."
Aladdin," Now, your hand!"
Jafar, How about my foot?
Aladdin, No!
Jafar," Get off me, monkey! Dirty monkey."
Aladdin, Aaahhh! We're alive.
Genie," Oh, great one who summons me. Terrible one who commands me. I stand by my oath. Loyalty to wishes three. I said... oh... great... Excuse me. Boy, where's your boss? Help me out here, where's your boss? If I was gonna talk to myself, I coulda just stayed in the lamp. Hello! Um..."
Genie, Use your big boy voice.
Aladdin, I'm... talking... to a smoking blue giant?
Genie, No! I am not a giant. I am a genie. There's a difference. Giants are not real. Where's your boss?
Aladdin," Um, my boss?"
Genie," Look, kid, I've been doing this a long time, all right? There's always a guy, you know. He's cheated somebody or buried somebody or... I mean, you get my point. Where's that guy?"
Aladdin, I know that guy. He's outside.
Genie," So... it's just... you and me down here? And a monkey. That's your personal business, but we gonna need to talk about that monkey later. Such a pretty little monkey. So, you rubbed the lamp?"
Aladdin, Uh-huh.
Genie," O...kay. Hey, do you mind if I just stretch it out over here? Do you mind?"
Aladdin, I'm your master?
Genie, Downward dog!
Aladdin," No, no, no. You look like you should be my master."
Genie," Right, but that's not quite how it works, though."
Aladdin, How long have you been trapped in here?
Genie, 'Bout a thousand years.
Aladdin, A thousand years?
Genie," [with Aladdin's head] A thousand years? Kid, is it me, or does, like, everything surprise you?So, you really don't know who I am? Genie, wishes, lamp? None of that ringin' a bell? Wow. Well, th-th-that's a first. Monkey! Oh, you don't need to worry about him, he's fine."
Genie," Well, Ali Baba, he had them forty thieves Scheherazade had a thousand tales"
Start song, Friend Like Me**
Genie," Here I go! Unh, ooh, woo! Back up! Uh-oh! Watch out! You done wound me up! 'Boutta show you what I'm workin' with, unh!"
Aladdin," AladdinGenie: Yes!One wish or two or threeWell, I'm on the job, you big nabobYou ain't never had a friend, never had a friendYou ain't never had a friend, never had a friendYou ain't neverNeverHad aHad aFriendFriendLikeLikeMe!You ain't never had a friend like meGenie: You can clap now. Puh-domp. No, no, no, no. Please, please, please, please. You can thank me outside. I-In the sun. When you wish us out.Aladdin: So, how does it work?"
Genie," You're... kidding, right? The whole song... was th-the instructions! Obviously you can't dance and listen at the same time. So here's the basics: Step one. Rub the lamp. Step two. Say what you want. Step three. There is no step three. See? It's that easy. You get three wishes. They must begin with rubbing the lamp and saying ""I wish"". Got it?"
Aladdin, I think so.
Genie," A couple other rules. You can't wish for more wishes. Three is enough. Now, I can't make anybody love anybody. Or bring anybody back from the dead. Feel free to interrupt me anytime you don't understand. I'm kidding. Don't ever interrupt me, no matter what. Now, I usually don't have to go through all this because by the time the guy gets to me, he pretty much knows what he wants and it generally has to do with tons of money and power! Do me a favor, do not drink from that cup. I promise you, there's not enough money and power on Earth for you to be satisfied. Good? So, what's your first wish?"
Aladdin," Mm, well... I have to think about it. I mean, if there are only three. Why are there only three, anyway?"
Genie, I don't know! Who cares?
Aladdin, I thought you were all-knowing?
Genie," That's 'cause you don't listen. I never said I was all-knowing. I said I was all-powerful. The most powerful being in the universe. Look, whatever I don't know, I know I can learn it. Outside in the sun. Why you playin' hard to wish? I know you can't tell, but I'm very pale. This is sky blue. My natural pigmentation is navy. Give us some sun!"
Aladdin," Okay, Genie. I wish for you to get us out of this cave."
Genie," Oh, yeah! He has made his first wish! Thank you for choosing carpets, camels and caravans. Please don't forget to tip your genie on the way out. Hold yourself, kid! Whoo! Whoa. Man, look at this world. It's so... big. Inside the lamp, everything's like, brass! Brass! Brass! Brass! Like, ooh, is that some copper? Nope! Brass! Sorta the problem with the genie life. Phenomenal cosmic powers, but itty-bitty living space."
Aladdin," So, is this magic? Or are you magic?"
Genie," Eh, kind of a package deal."
Aladdin, Can you warn me before you do that?
Genie," Oh, you'll get used to it."
Aladdin," Right. So, do I have to make"
Genie," No, no, no, no, no. I can look totally normal."
Aladdin, Right. Totally normal. Still blue. Do we need the top knot?
Genie," That's my little cherry on top. Okay, okay. So... What are you gonna wish?"
Aladdin," Oh, I-I haven't thought about that."
Genie, Mm. You really are not that guy. Okay.
Aladdin, So what would you wish for?
Genie," No one's ever asked me that before. An easy one though. I wish to be free. To not have to say, Can I help you? What would you like? Welcome to the lamp. May I take your order please? Freedom. I wish to be... To be human."
Aladdin, Why don't you just set yourself free?
Genie," Carpet! Did you hear what this boy said? Why don't I set myself free? Only way a genie gets to be free is if the owner of the lamp uses one of his wishes to set him free. And the last time that happened was, like, the fourth of Never-ary."
Aladdin," I'll do it. I've got three, right?"
Genie," Actually, you have two left. You used one to get out of the cave, remember?"
Aladdin, Did I? Or did you? I thought I had to be rubbing the lamp?
Genie," Okay, little street boy. Let's rewind the tape. Okay, Genie. Oooh! The old monkey-with-the-lamp trick. Never seen that one before. Keep my eye on you."
Aladdin, At least now I can use my third wish to set you free.
Genie," Here's the thing about wishes. The more you have, the more you want."
Aladdin, That's not me.
Genie, Hmm. We'll see about that.
Aladdin, But there is something.
Genie, Uh-oh. Seen that face before. Who is she? Who's the girl?
Aladdin, She's a princess.
Genie," Aww, aren't they all? Treat your woman like a queen, I always say."
Aladdin," No. No, she's an actual princess."
Genie," Well, I already told you. I can't make anyone love anyone, so."
Aladdin," No, no. We had a connection."
Genie, Did they?
Aladdin," She is smart and kind and so beautiful. But she has to marry a...Hey, can you make me a prince?"
Genie," There's a lot of gray area in ""make me a prince"". I could just... make you a prince."
Aladdin," Oh, no."
Genie," Right, you'd be snuggled up with that dude for the rest of your life."
Prince," Yo, you all seen my palace?"
Genie, Be specific with your words. The deal is in the detail.
Aladdin, Got it.
Genie," Which I don't really understand because if she already likes you, why change?"
Aladdin, I told you she has to marry a prince.
Prince," I just wanna go home, man."
Genie, Okay. I can do that.
Aladdin, Genie... I wish...
Genie, Lamp?
Aladdin, Oh. Sorry. All right. Genie...
Genie," Don't hurt him, Genie."
Aladdin, I wish... to become... a prince.
Genie," Back up, boy, I need some room to work. I'm about to fabulize you."
Aladdin, Genie?
Genie," A little head-spinning. Better though, right?"
Aladdin, I think I'm... getting used to it.
Genie," Okay, a prince, a prince. Obviously, the ghetto-chic is not gonna work. I'm feeling a periwinkle."
Aladdin, Wh-What's periwinkle?
Genie, No. Chartreuse. The lines are all wrong.
Aladdin, What is this?
Genie, The color clashes with your skin tone. The silhouette is confused.
Aladdin, This is a big hat.
Genie," No, that is not a big hat. Come on, Genie, gotta beat the door down. Gotta go bold! Gotta... gold! Aah, no! We've gone too far."
Aladdin, Genie!
Genie," You slippin.’ It's gotta be neutral for the desert. Ivory, beige, bone, Albion. It's a little heavy. Oh! And the crowd goes wild! Oho! The Genie! The Genie's on fire! The Genie's on fire, folks. Somebody cool me down! Somebody put me out! I'm too much! So what do you think?"
Aladdin, I like it.
Genie," Of course you like it, boy. I made it."
Aladdin," I think that's me. Strictly speaking, it... it's me."
Genie," I mean, I did most of the work. You was just standing there. But I hear you."
Aladdin, But won't people recognize me?
Genie, Nobody will recognize you. That's how genie magic works. People see what
 Aladdin, Right. Who am I?
Genie, Who... Prince... Ali. - From? Duh From Abuvwah.
Aladdin, A-bab-wah?
Genie, You're not listenin' Ababwah.
Aladdin, Is that a real place?
Genie," Yeah. Like, everybody knows about it. It has a brochure. A little hot in the summer, temperate in the fall. I-I'll let you read it en route."
Aladdin, How are we gonna get there?
Genie," I guess you can't ride a chimp. Don't you just love a moonwalking monkey? Uh-uh, hold it there, Abu. Donkey. Too small. No. Too obvious. We need something robust. Relax, Abu. It's just for a minute."
Aladdin, Whoa. Prince Ali... of Ababwah.

Aladdin, You do?
Aladdin," I, uh, I don't believe we've"
Aladdin," I, uh, I will think on that."
Jafar,Perhaps I'm not
Genie, 
Aladdin, 
Jafar," As the old man said, “You should have left Agrabah when you had the chance.” I told you before to think bigger. You could have been the most powerful man in the room. But now, I hold the lamp. I hold the power."
Aladdin," You can’t find what you’re looking for in that lamp, Jafar. I tried and failed, and so will you."
Jafar, You think so? But I am Sultan! I am the greatest sorcerer the world has ever seen. I will create an empire that history cannot ignore. I can destroy cities. I can destroy kingdoms. And I can destroy you.
Aladdin," True. But who made you a sultan? Who made you a sorcerer? There will always be some thing, some man, some being more powerful than you."
Genie, What are you doing?
Aladdin," Genie gave you your power, and he can take it away."
Jafar, HE SERVES ME!
Aladdin," For now. But you’ll never have more power than the genie. You said it yourself, you’re either the most powerful in the room, or you’re nothing. You will always be second."
Iago, Second. Second. [squawks]
Jafar," Second?! Only second?! HE SERVES ME!! I will make sure no one will ever say these words again! Genie, for my final wish, I wish to become the most powerful being in the universe! More powerful than you!"
Genie," A lot of gray area in that wish. But, uh, the most powerful being in the universe, coming right up!"
Jafar," The most powerful in the universe! At last! Second to no one! And I thought I had power before! First, I’ll lay waste to those fools in Sherabad."
Jafar, What have you done to me?
Aladdin," I haven’t done anything to you, Jafar."
Jafar, What have you done to me?!
Aladdin," This was your wish, not mine. A genie might have phenomenal cosmic powers…"
Genie," But an itty-bitty living space. You see, a genie without a master, goes back in their lamp."
Jafar," I will not forget you, boy! Mark my words. I will not forget what you have done to me!"
Iago," Goodbye, Jafar."
Jafar, Parrot! You’re coming with me! [he grabs Iago as he gets sucked into his lamp]
Aladdin, Okay.
Genie, Last wish.
Aladdin, Genie.
Genie, I'm ready. Hold on. Here we go.
Aladdin, I wish...
Genie, Third and final wish.
Aladdin, I wish...to set you free.
Genie, Wait. Tell-tell me to do something.
Aladdin, Uh...give me some jams.

Genie, Thank you.

Aladdin, He's not coming to the wedding... he died a long time ago.
Genie, (Reverting back to normal) Sorry.

luk, Why do you walk in the open while I suffocate like an animal?
Cassim," Someone has to keep a cool head, Sa'luk."
luk, Someone will have no head if this is another wild goose chase.
Cassim, The Oracle is the real thing. (Sa'luk pulls his claws away) This time I'm sure...
Setting, Palace of Agrabah; Courtyard)
Thor, I'm Thor.
Genie, You're Thor?
Thor," Well, it hurts."
Genie," Once again, this whole broadcast has been brought to you by sand. It's everywhere. (A logo appears reading 'Sand- it's everywhere'. Genie walks in front of it.) Get used to it!"
Setting, The Wedding Pavilion; Gift Table)
Abu," Come on, come on (Abu moves his hands in a 'come on' motion)"
Iago, I can see fine from back here.
Abu," Uh uh, it's Aladdin!"
Iago," Look, there's one thing I get sentimental about, and I'm sittin' on it."
Iago," The loot monkey, the loot!"
Setting, The Wedding Pavilion)
Genie," Bad news Al, the boutonnières clash with the cumber buns! (Genie holds out a white boutonnière and a brown cumber bun.)"
Aladdin," Genie, isn't it a little late for that?"
Genie," What, what are you trying to say? Out with it! (Genie looks around) What, what... (He sees the crowd) ...they're here. Oh no! (Genie changes into the White Rabbit from ""<a href=""/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland"" title=""Alice in Wonderland"">Alice in Wonderland</a>"") I'm late; I'm late, for a very important date! (Genie runs through the aisle and through the doors.)"
Crowd," You're majesty, your highness!"
Sultan," (Nudging Aladdin with his elbow) Don't look so solemn boy, this is a happy day."
Genie," Oh look, it's a Kodiak moment. (From Genie's left side, a bear roars. Genie grabs it by the mouth.) Put that bear out of here! (Genie makes a white carpet appear, led by doves. It covers the entire isle. The peacocks standing in front of the door contract their feathers, revealing Jasmine.)"
Sultan, Ohh...
Aladdin, Wow....
Genie, Oh Yeah!
Sultan, I never thought this day would come. Now I'm afraid that it has come all too soon.
Jasmine, (Hugs Sultan) Oh father.
Cassim, You distract the guards
luk, Part of your plan?
Cassim, (He pets an elephant's trunks) A large part. (He knocks on one of the baskets) It's time.
Thieves, Oh!
Genie, It's all so magical. I'm not gonna cry. I'm not...
Cleopatra, It's so beautiful.
Caesar, I promise you I wouldn't cry.
Carpet, HEY!
Genie," Oh, sorry."
Aladdin," Well, we're here..."
Jasmine, Together forever.
luk, Let me be the point man!
Genie, I thought the Earth wasn't supposed to move until the honeymoon...
Sultan," Oh, oh, my word!"
Genie, (Wearing a cowboy hat and plaids) Stampede!
Iago, What is going on here?
Genie," Come here monkey boy, you were almost Dumbo toe jam! (An elephant walks over Carpet) Oh, they trampled the carpet... that's a little redundant. So this isn't really a bad day for you, is it?"
Fazal, It's an attack!
Rasoul, Not in this palace!
Genie," Oh, I think we're going to have a little problem with leaks. (Genie flies to the ceiling and positions himself in front of the hole.)"
Cassim, It must be here somewhere!
Iago," Meet your match, Zorro!"
Cassim, Good birdie! Polly want a little...
Iago, (Citing his shot with the candlestick) Say cracker and I'll let you have it on principle!
Cassim, You have a lot of spirit. (Cassim pushes Iago into a nearby vase) And a lot of mouth.
Thief, Ha ha ha!
luk, Ha ha ha!
Fazal, They fight like demons!
Hakim, Worse than demons. These are the Forty Thieves!
Genie, Really? I get thirty-nine...
Aladdin, Forty.
Cassim, Where is it?
Cassim," Ah, at last!"
Aladdin, Can I see your invitation?
Cassim, Stay out of my way boy and you won't get hurt!
Cassim," Fool, you don't stand a chance against the King of Thieves."
Aladdin," When I get up, I'll bow to you!"
Jasmine, That was for ruining my wedding!
Thieves, Huh?
Genie, I guess there's really no point to this now.
Genie, Freeze sandbags; don't make me use the other end!
luk, Cassim said nothing about facing the powers of a genie! (Turning to the tall thief behind him) Get the others out of here. We'll leave the King to his plans.
Cassim, Oooh!
Aladdin, Where's the King of Thieves?
Setting, Outside the Pavilion)
Cassim," I'll see you again, boy! (He runs off)"
Genie, Oooh...This is not my fault! This was not built to code!
Iago, Good luck getting back the catering department.
Sultan, Oh my...
Genie," Fear not, oh father of the bride. (Genie turns into a construction worker with a muscular chest) We can rebuild!"
Sultan," Oh, please do. We can't have a wedding without a pavilion! (Genie's chest muscles fall to his gut. Genie shrugs)"
Genie," (Writing on a clipboard) All right, a wedding pavilion it is my man. (Genie turns Iago, Abu, and Carpet into construction workers. Iago is eating a sandwich. Abu is eating a doughnut. Carpet is reading the paper) Hey, I want to see some resumes on these guys. And don't let the one with the beak near any power tools. (A drill sounds)"
Sultan," Yes, yes, Genie, whatever it takes. I am sorry about all this Jasmine. (Jasmine is gone) Daughter?"
Jasmine," What were they after, the gifts?"
Aladdin, Not all the gifts. This is what the King of Thieves wanted. (Holds out the treasure)
Iago," (Landing on the treasure) With all the other great stuff, why go for this thing?"
Oracle, Your question is mine to answer! The King of Thieves sought my sight to find the Ultimate Treasure.
Iago, Did someone say treasure?
Aladdin, (To Genie) Genie?
Genie, (Wearing sunglasses) Oh... Looks like an Oracle.
Oracle," I see all that has been, and all that will be."
Genie," (As <a href=""/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman"" title=""Dustin Hoffman"">Dustin Hoffman</a> in ""<a href=""/wiki/Rain_Man"" title=""Rain Man"">Rain man</a>"") Uh oh, uh oh, definitely an Oracle, tells the future, uh oh. (To Jasmine, back to normal) Girlfriend, where were you registered?"
Iago," Okay, you know all, so tell all. Where is the treasure? You know, the ultimate one?"
Oracle," I am bound by the rule of one. One question, one answer."
Iago, I only want one answer! Where is the Ultimate Treasure?
Oracle, You have already asked your question.
Iago," You mean before? Oh, that wasn't a question! That was uh... thinking out loud."
Genie, (Grabbing Iago) Very loud.
Jasmine," Aladdin, we could learn anything. About our lives, our future."
Oracle, You have but to ask.
Aladdin," (To Jasmine) I know what my future is, my future is you. But my past... it's a blank. My mother died when I was just a kid, and I never even knew my father. I have no idea where I come from."
Oracle, Your question is your choice. But remember the rule of one. Choose carefully.
Iago," Oh sure, she warns him about the one question thing. (Carpet hits him out of the way) Hey!"
Aladdin," I don't think you can help me. My past isn't just one question, it's a million questions."
Oracle," Ah, but mere questions about your past can be answered by your father..."
Aladdin," My father? (The Oracle moves her hands, making a picture appear. It is an older man, with a strong resemblance to Aladdin) My father is alive..."
Setting," The Marketplace, sundown)"
Jasmine," Abu, where's Aladdin? (She looks up to see Aladdin in his hovel) How long has he been up there?"
Setting, Aladdin's Hovel)
Jasmine," (Entering the hovel) Aladdin, Are you alright? (She picks up the Oracle and sits beside Aladdin) What's wrong?"
Aladdin," I always wanted to know about my father. But just now, I'm not so sure. (Standing up) What kind of man leaves his son? Did he even care? (Sighs) Maybe I don't wanna know him."
Jasmine, Yes you do.
Aladdin, How can you be so sure?
Jasmine, Because I already know him. (Aladdin seems confused) Because I know you.
Jasmine, You showed me the world when I was all locked up inside.
Aladdin, Oh Jasmine...
Aladdin, There's so much I want to know
Jasmine, You've got the chance to learn.
Aladdin," If it means, I'd have to go..."
Jasmine, I'll be right here when you return. Our wedding can wait.
Aladdin, I love you.
Jasmine, I think it's worth this small delay.
Aladdin, Maybe you're right.
Jasmine, And won't it be great to have your father see our wedding day? It isn't too late.
Aladdin, I've waited so long to learn the truth.
Both and Abu," And now at least, we can finally say."
Jasmine, You're father is really there.
Aladdin, There's so much that we might share.
Jasmine," And you'll finally learn, you"
Both and Abu, Don't come out of thin air.
Oracle, Have you chosen your question?
Aladdin, I have.
Oracle, Then ask.
Aladdin, Where is my father?
Oracle, (Pointing) Follow the trail of the Forty Thieves. Your father is trapped within their world.
Aladdin, The Forty Thieves? Is he hurt? How long has he been their prisoner?
Oracle, I am sorry. I can only answer one question. (The Oracle disappears)
Aladdin, It's up to me.
Jasmine, Take as long as you need.
Aladdin," I'll be back in time for our wedding, I promise."
Setting, The Desert)
Iago, I should have stayed with the Genie. Manual labor beats danger any day.
Aladdin," Good, the trail's still fresh."
Iago, Definitely should have stayed with the Genie... (Carpet speeds up to catch the horses) Ah!
Aladdin," Shh... (Carpet flies back behind the cliff.) ...Phew. Well they have nowhere to go, we have them trapped."
Iago," We? They are Forty Thieves. We are you, a rug, a monkey, and me. Wait, don't count me."
Aladdin, They're just standing there
Cassim, Open sesame!
Aladdin," Let's move. Hang on! (Aladdin and the gang follow, making it in just before the door closes. Aladdin looks over a rock and into the lair. The lair is golden and misty, like a long-forgotten city.) I know Carpet, it's incredible. (Carpet grabs Aladdin and points toward the door) What?"
Iago, How bad is it? (Iago has his tail feathers stuck in the door)
Abu, Hmm...
Iago," Yee ow! Ohh, this is attractive! (Iago's feathers are stuck in the door. He walks over, pulls them out, and puts them back on his tail.)"
Aladdin, (Shakes his head) Come on.
Setting, Farther into the lair)
Iago," Ya wanna not hold up traffic? (Ringing out his feathers) I want to get in, get out, and go home. Actually, I wouldn't mind skipping right to the go home..."
luk, We could have had all the loot from the wedding. But we followed the king's plan. This is what we have to show for our trouble in Agrabah: NOTHING!
 Asian Man, Sa'luk is truly ticked!
Aladdin, Cassim? My father...
Cassim," If you're talking about spilling my blood, well, I just don't see that happening. (He folds his arms and smirks defiantly)"
luk, Then let me open your eyes!
Aladdin," Run, I've got him! I'm Aladdin, you're my father!"
Thieves, His Father?
luk," I don't know about father boy, but I'll send you to meet your other ancestors."
 White Man, It's true?
 Asian Man," Ohh, the boy is the son of the King of Thieves."
Aladdin, *You* are the King of Thieves?
Cassim," Like it or not boy, we're blood. (Cassim throws the dagger to Aladdin) Look at you. I'd thought I'd never see you again. Has it been so long?"
luk," Blood or mud, the boy is an intruder. (Sa'luk steps in between Cassim and Aladdin. He shoves Aladdin out of the way.) And we have rules about intruders."
Thieves," Sa'luk is right. He knows our secrets! I hate intruders. Wait, wait, me too!"
luk, He has found our secret lair. He has seen too much. He must die. They must all die!
Iago, Die? He's your son. (Abu nods in agreement) I'm his friend! (Abu gives Iago a dirty look) Cast a vote for mercy here!
Thieves," Maybe Sa'luk should be king? Yes, maybe he should"
Cassim, Kill him.
Cassim," Or the boy could, yes the boy could... no."
 Fat Man," What, what? The boy could what?"
Cassim," Nothing, probably a bad idea."
Triplets, Let's hear it.
Cassim," Well, it seems to me that... oh never mind."
Cassim, The boy could face 'the challenge.'
Thieves," Ah...That's right, 'the challenge.'"
Cassim," That's that, my son shall face 'the challenge.'"
luk, And I shall be the one to test him.
Setting, Outside the Lair)
Setting, On Top of The Cliff Above the Forty Thieves Lair)
Iago, Escape? Not likely. Our ride home is grounded.
Iago, And Al? Well... it's been nice knowin' 'em.
Aladdin," What's goin' on, Dad?"
Cassim," Oh, the challenge is simple enough... only one man survives. But you're my son. You'll be that man. Knock 'em dead kid, seriously."
Thieves, Go Sa'luk! Kick 'em!
Aladdin, Ah! (Aladdin grabs his arm)
Cassim, No!
Iago, I thought oz-eyed won?
Aladdin," Look, I...I... I didn't mean..."
Thieves, Get him! Take him to the King! (The thieves pick Aladdin up and pass him to Cassim)
Iago," (The thieves cut open the cage) I don't even know Aladdin, okay? (The thieves free Iago and Abu and pass them to Cassim)"
Cassim, You killed Sa'luk. The code of the Forty Thieves is very clear on this point. You're in!
Thieves, Yah!
Thieves," Congratulations, bub!"
Iago," Oh, I love you guys."
Thieves, Schemin' up a scam
Cassim, Together we're the perfect team
Iago," Live a life o' leisure, counting all your treasure!"
Thieves, As an honorary member of the gang
Setting, Outside the Forty Thieves Lair)
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; Jasmine's Balcony)
Genie," Boy, and I thought I was blue. (Genie appears down beside Jasmine)"
Jasmine," You would know if Aladdin is in trouble, wouldn't you? (She turns to Genie) I thought he'd be back by now."
Genie," Al will be back... (Genie pauses for a moment, then perks up as if he has an idea. He turns into Mrs. Doubtfire) Listen to Genie dear, Genie knows. You have to get your mind off this incessant waiting. (Genie poofs himself and Jasmine into the throne room) Here's a surefire way to cheer up a bummed out bride to be. A heaping helping of matrimonial magic! (Genie makes gifts appear all through the throne room. Gifts include bouquets of flowers, cars, baby carriages, and balloons. Jasmine reaches to pick a flower from a bouquet, when Genie, as Harpo Marx, jumps into her arms and tries to kiss her. A cane pulls him away. Genie as Chico Marx walks up to Jasmine) Hey, that's no good. What a wedding needs is a theme. (Genie as Grouch Marx walks up to Jasmine) It needs a groom too, but let's work with what we have..."
Jasmine, Genie!
Genie," (Back to normal) It's a joke. I do that. Okay, let's see... this will be the second wedding for both of you. I'm thinking we need something a little more simple, a little more elegant and less gray. (Makes an elephant appears) Ha, ha, ha! Did it, done it, own it! (Makes the elephant disappear) I gonna' throw some colors at you, mauve, teal, and salmon. (Genie makes paint slabs appear in Jasmine's hand. For the salmon, however, a real fish appears) What do you like, besides the salmon? (Genie throws the salmon against a wall) Okay, Madonna. Don't keep it. Just put that in the mix, wink. (Genie nudges Jasmine with his elbow) Okay, I see lasers! (Genie turns the throne room into a Las Vegas-like atmosphere, complete with lasers and flashing lights) It's a miracle! He believes, he believes! (Genie turns into Elvis Presley) Thank you very much!"
Genie," (Back to normal) Tres gauch right? Well, maybe you could elope? No, you can't elope. But oh honeydew! (Genie throws a honeydew melon to the center of the room) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (The honeydew turns into a carriage. Jasmine's attire changes to Cinderella's) I don't whether to put it under props or produce. Please, don't squeeze the tires, they're not ripe. And how 'bout that gown? (Genie makes the carriage disappear. Jasmine appears in Snow White's down, with forest animals all around her. Genie acts as an announcer) Whether you're dancing with dwarves or simply biting the apple, it says I'm a princess for now!"
Jasmine," Uh, Genie..."
Genie," (Changing Jasmine back to normal) Hey, it's Synergy. (Other Genies wearing lab coats appear. One holds up a picture of Jasmine. Another Genie holds up pictures of Ariel's, Minnie Mouse's, and Jessica Rabbit's clothing in front of the picture of Jasmine) The marketing guys are very excited, it tests really well!"
Jasmine," Thank you, Genie. I'm sure it will be wonderful. (Kisses Genie on the cheek) And thanks for cheering me up."
Genie," (as <a href=""/wiki/Bing_Crosby"" title=""Bing Crosby"">Bing Crosby</a>) I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy are on the road to Agrabah right now. Isn't that right Bob? (As Bob Hope) That's right, Bing, how 'bout this town? Is it wild or what? It's like one giant sand trap, and me without my wedgie. Hey, let's give a big hand for Brooke Shields."
Setting, The Forty Thieves Lair)
Cassim," I find my son, and lose my enemy. You did your old man proud, Aladdin."
Aladdin, I was just trying to stay alive.
Cassim," Ha! If you didn't fight, you would have been killed. So says the code of the Forty Thieves."
Iago, Does this code have any rules that don't end in death?
Cassim, It's a strict code. But there's one thing that I added. We never hurt the innocent.
Iago," For future reference, I'm as innocent as the day I was hatched."
Abu, Oh brother...
Cassim, My men don't even know about this place.
Cassim," Listen boy, there is a treasure. The Ultimate Treasure. (Cassim throws his torch into water, extinguishing it.) Compared to this, a pharaoh's tomb is a pauper's grave. A sultan's fortune nothing but... lunch money! And I am this close to it... (Cassim makes a gesture with his hand, indicating how close.)"
Iago, That's tantalizingly close...
Cassim, But it's on an island that is never in the same place twice. (Cassim digs into a closet and pulls out a rug.) The Vanishing Isle.
Iago, That... would be a problem.
Aladdin, What is this Ultimate Treasure?
Cassim," The big one, boy. The Hand of Midas."
Cassim," It's not a myth, boy."
Cassim," It was once right here, look, there's your proof. (Cassim angles the torch to the water. A reflection of a golden ship appears.) From stern to stem, every piece of rigging every peg and board, all of it! Solid gold!"
Iago, Adopt me Daddy-o!
Cassim, Touched by the Hand of Midas
Aladdin, And sunk by it...
Cassim," You don't understand. You don't know what it's like to have nothing. To stare up at the palace and know you deserve more. (Cassim throws the torch into the water) To be called ""street rat""."
Cassim," I knew exactly what I wanted for my family, the best. (Cassim, coming through the curtain, puts his arm around Aladdin's shoulders.) I couldn't give up and go back empty handed. But the weeks turned into months and the months turned into years... I came back to Agrabah one night, but I couldn't find my wife, or my son. I thought my family was lost forever. At that moment, I would have traded anything to get your mother back..."
Aladdin," We never wanted gold... we wanted you. I wanted a father, I still do. Come to my wedding. This time, you have an invitation."
Cassim," Aladdin, I just don't know..."
Cassim," Aladdin may never understand, but it just wouldn't work. I don't belong in his world."
Cassim, The Oracle... probably just another dead end.
Iago," It works! That's how the kid found you, it knows everything!"
Cassim, Everything?
Setting, Agrabah; Night)
luk," Captain, over here!"
luk," You're alone, good."
luk, What would you say if I handed you the King of Thieves?
Rasoul, I'd say... (Rasoul puts his sword away) ...what's in it for you?
luk, I'll just sleep better knowing that he's off the streets... and on the executioner's block.
Rasoul, Everyone knows that the King of Thieves cannot be caught. What miracle do you possess?
Setting, The Forty Thieves' Lair; Dawn)
Aladdin," Hop on, Dad!"
Cassim," Oh no! It's a rug, you sweep dirt under it, you don't fly on it. At least, I don't."
Aladdin," (Circling Cassim) Don't be afraid, it's fun!"
Cassim," I am not afraid! Now, get off that thing before you break your neck!"
Aladdin," I trust Carpet with my life! (Aladdin jumps off Carpet) (To Carpet) Give 'em time, he'll come around."
Cassim," (Walking up some stairs) We'll take horses. Horses were good enough for my father, and his father before him. And they were always good enough for me."
Aladdin," He sounds like a father, alright."
Abu, Uh huh.
Fazal, But there is nothing here!
Rasoul," Now, but watch. (Opening his arms, with a big smile on his face) Open Caraway! (Nothing happens. Rasoul smile fades)"
Hakim, There is still nothing here...
Rasoul, When I get a hold of that no good... (Rasoul turns around to leave)
Fazal, But I thought you said it was Open Sesame?
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; Outside)
Aladdin, Looks like Genie has everything ready...
Abu," Yeah, uh huh."
Cassim, Genie? You have a Genie? Have you used all three wishes yet?
Iago," Oh, please, don't go into it. It's just too painful."
Genie," Oh, Al! You're back! And you're front! You're both here! (Genie hugs Aladdin)"
Aladdin," That's great, Genie..."
Genie," (Puts his hand over Aladdin's lips, silencing him.) Security's tight. No big crowd, immediate family only."
Aladdin," Perfect, because this is my..."
Genie," No lowlifes this time, other than the parrot of course. Observe... (Genie pulls out a remote. He pushes a button, and a giant robot comes out.]"
Robot," You have violated the perimeter of the Aladdin and Jasmine wedding; prepare to be vaporized, thank you. (A laser shoots toward the group. They all duck)"
Genie, Armed and dangerous. I'd like to see one of those Forty Thieves get within an inch of your wedding. (Makes a gesture with his fingers)
Iago, Allow me to introduce...
Cassim," Ha ha, the King of Thieves"
Genie," Ah! All units, we have a code red (""Code red"" echoes about as dozens of Genies in army uniforms come out of all corners of the Palace. Another posse of Genies, as Scotsman wearing kilts, appears) Come on boys, follow me! (The Genies approach the group, playing bagpipes. Another posse of Genies appear, as soldiers on horses) Calvary commence! Code red! (A plane flies over the palace. Genie soldiers jump out.) Geronimo! Arapaho! Navajo! (Genie, dressed as Pocahontas, jumps out of the plane) Pocahontas! Code red. (Hundreds of Genies carrying guns surround Cassim and Iago.) Do not attempt to move, or we'll be shooting ourselves."
Aladdin, (Breaks through the crowd) Genie!
Genie," Back off, Al. This creep has a yellow sheet as long as my arm."
Aladdin," Genie, meet my dad."
Genie," Stand down boys, smoke 'em if you got 'em. (The other Genies disappear. Genie approaches Cassim) If you're Al's dad, and the King of Thieves, I just wanna know one thing."
Cassim, Yeah?
Genie, (Wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie) Will you be having the chicken or the sea bass?
Aladdin," Come on, Dad. I can't wait for you to meet Jasmine and the Sultan."
Genie," Ahem, Al? (Genie stops him) Don't you think we should lose the 'Agrabah's Most Wanted' look? (Genie pulls down a poster reading ""Agrabah's Most Wanted."" Cassim's head is in the place of the picture.)"
Aladdin," When you're here, you're not the King of Thieves. (Aladdin pulls down Cassim's mask) You're my dad."
Cassim, (Pulling the cloak away from his head) I've had more practice being the King of Thieves...
Genie," Oh, Come on, enough of this dark past. Let's roll out something a little new."
Genie," It's a big, bright, beautiful future."
Cassim, May be a bumpy ride
Aladdin, We'll make it side by side
Genie," Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide"
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; Throne Room)
Cassim, My boy Aladdin must have been born under a lucky star to find such a treasure.
Jasmine, You are most definitely Aladdin's father.
Genie, I have the DNA to prove it.
Sultan," It must have been dreadful, trapped by the Forty Thieves!"
Genie, Uh oh...
Cassim, I try to block out the memories...
Sultan," Say no more, not another word on the subject!"
Cassim," Yes, let's turn our attention to happier thoughts. The blessed union of our children! (Cassim picks the Sultan up and hugs him.)"
Sultan, Indeed...
Aladdin, It worked Genie! They love 'im!
Genie, (Genie takes off his scalp) It's the hat. Nothing does the trick like a smart chapeau
Cassim," Ah, back among civilized people, back among family..."
Aladdin, It's more than that. All he needed was a second chance.
Cassim, ...It's a miracle.
Setting," Palace of Agrabah, Dungeon)"
Thieves, You'll pay for this! You sold us out!
Thief, Ow! He got my nose...
luk, He's not in there!
luk, You didn't capture the King of Thieves?
Rasoul, Because he was not at the hideout.
luk," He had to be there, where else would he be?"
Guard," Apologizes, Captain Rasoul..."
luk, (Yelling) What?
Guard," Well, The Sultan said he won't be able to sentence your prisoners until tomorrow..."
Rasoul, What's more important than sentencing my prisoners?
Guard, Why the wedding! Princess Jasmine and Aladdin are finally getting married!
luk, Aladdin? (Sa'luk grabs the young guard by the shirt) You didn't capture Aladdin with the others? (Sa'luk throws the guard on the ground)
Rasoul, Why would he be with the Forty Thieves?
luk, Because his father is the King of Thieves!
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; Hallway)
Sultan," Oh, where could he be? I do hope nothing's wrong. Perhaps we should dispatch a search party?"
Jasmine," Now father, I'm sure he's... on his way."
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; Wedding Pavilion)
Aladdin, Where is he?
Genie, Hakuna Matata! (Genie changes back to normal) Whoa... I was having an out of movie experience. My guess is he wants to make an entrance.
Setting, Outside the Royal Treasury)
Iago, Here's the monkey's lock picks. You know how to use 'em?
Cassim," I promise you bird, after this, I go straight."
Rasoul, Straight to the dungeon!
Iago, Ah!
Rasoul, We've been expecting you!
Setting, The Wedding Pavilion)
Jasmine, Do you think something is wrong?
Aladdin," Genie, can you find him?"
Genie," I'll sniff him out. (Genie turns in to Pluto and begins sniffing around) I need a scrap of his clothes or a lock of his hair... (Genie smells a shoe that is in his path) Or shoe, a shoe's good..."
Aladdin, Huh?
Sultan," Rasoul, what is the meaning of this?"
Rasoul," (Rasoul pushes Cassim toward the Sultan) Your majesty, meet the King of Thieves."
Aladdin, Dad!
Rasoul, We seized him in the Treasury. He was after this... (shows the Oracle) ...again.
Aladdin, (in disbelief) No...
Rasoul, And this is his accomplice.
Iago," Big misunderstanding! It's a slap on the wrist and, uh, community service kinda thing!"
Aladdin, Now I know why you really came back...
Sultan, Your father is the leader of the Forty Thieves? This is most... ooh!
Jasmine," Aladdin, did you know?"
Aladdin," I thought I could change him, I had to try!"
Cassim," You can change my clothes Aladdin, you can't change who I am."
Rasoul, And the law is crystal clear on what we must now do!
Jasmine," (Puts her hand on Sultan's shoulder) Father, isn't there another way?"
Sultan, I'm afraid there is not. Take the prisoners to the dungeon.
Iago, Dungeon?
Sultan, For life.
Iago, Life?
Genie, (To Aladdin) There's some wishes that even I can't make come true...
Setting," Agrabah, Aladdin's Hovel)"
Aladdin, The Oracle was right. My dad was trapped in the world of the Forty Thieves. Trapped by his own greed. I was so stupid to think I could change him.
Genie," Trying to show him a better life wasn't stupid, Al. (Using his fist as a puppet) Leaving him alone with the parrot, that was stupid."
Aladdin," Everything was perfect before he came into my life. I just want things the way they were. Genie, I need my father's clothes."
Genie," A-A-Al, what did you wrap the turban too tight? (Genie makes a twisty motion with his fingers) Come on, why would you want to dress in the 'King of Thieves' ensemble?"
Genie," Might I suggest something that doesn't actually say (Wearing a prison uniform) ""Arrest me!""?"
Aladdin, (Wearing Cassim's outfit) It fits. Good.
Aladdin," I'm breaking my father out of the dungeon. The guards'll never know I was there. Tonight, the King of Thieves will make his most miraculous escape ever... out of my life. (He leaves)"
Genie," It's the cape talking, isn't it?"

Fazal," Since he's captured the King of Thieves, there's no living with Rasoul."
Hakim," Well, it wasn't exactly easy living with him before."
Setting," The Palace of Agrabah, the Dungeon)"
Cassim, Who?
Aladdin, I've come to say goodbye (Aladdin begins unlocking Cassim's chains)
Cassim, Why are you...?
Aladdin," We don't have much time. While the guards chase me, you get out. (Aladdin takes the cuffs off Cassim's wrists)"
Cassim, I can't let you...
Aladdin, (Throwing the keys to Cassim) Forget it. They can't catch me.
Cassim, He even sounds like me...
Setting," The Palace of Agrabah, the Guard's Quarters)"
Rasoul," When the Sultan gives me my due, I'll put the good word in for you, the little people who... (Rasoul sees Aladdin's reflection in the mirror) It can't be. (Hakim, Fazal, and Rasoul go into the hallway.) He was here, I know it."
Fazal, The King of Thieves!
Hakim, No man can escape that cell!
Fazal," He isn't a man I say, he's a demon!"
Rasoul," I want him, dead or alive!"
Setting," Agrabah, The Marketplace)"
Rasoul, Surround the block! He's close... I can feel it.
Guards," Which way did he go? I don't see him! Look over that way, hurry!"
Rasoul," Get up there, now, now, now!"
Fazal, Found him!
Hakim, Lost him.
Guards," (Hanging over the edge of the roof, searching for Aladdin) Which way did he go? I heard him over there... no over there, over there!"
Rasoul," Gotcha. (Aladdin falls) The King of Thieves. Your charmed life is over, your majesty! (Rasoul tries to stab Aladdin, but Aladdin pulls away. The cape rips, revealing Aladdin's true identity) You?"
Aladdin, Yes.
Rasoul," Then, I guess I'll have to settle for the Prince of Thieves. We shall see if the Sultan wants you in his family now."
Cassim, Keep your hands off my son!
Aladdin, Dad?
Cassim," Hurry son, we must move!"
Setting, The Desert)
Aladdin, Did we lose 'em?
Cassim," They won't be able to pick up our trail until daylight. By then, we'll be long gone from Agrabah. (Aladdin looks back at the Palace of Agrabah) I'm sorry for what you lost, but you can't go back now, you know that. (Aladdin gets off his horse) What are you doing?"
Aladdin, I'm not going with you... I can't.
Cassim," Well, you can't go back! The moment they saw your face your life in Agrabah was over."
Aladdin, I have to go back. Jasmine is there.
Iago," Kid, it's over, you're a criminal now."
Aladdin," I won't do what he did, I won't run away."
Cassim, (Approaching Aladdin) I never ran away from anything in my life!
Aladdin, You ran away from your family!
Cassim," I told you what happened. What else could I do, what else can you do?"
Aladdin, The right thing. You should take this back. (Aladdin throws the Midas Dagger at Cassim).
Cassim, You can't!
Aladdin, I won't walk out on Jasmine!
Cassim, Aladdin...
Aladdin," I'm your son, but I can't live your life."
Iago," Al, they'll lock you up!"
Aladdin," If there's a punishment, I'll take it."
Cassim, So be it...
Iago," (Landing on Aladdin's shoulder) We have the Oracle, the treasure's just waitin' for us!"
Aladdin, The Oracle?
Cassim, I had nothing left to lose!
Aladdin," Yes, you did."
Iago, It was supposed to be a father son outing.
Aladdin," (Aladdin takes Iago off his shoulder) Go with him, Iago."
Iago, What? Ya mean it? Really?
Aladdin, Go! (Aladdin gestures Iago toward Cassim)
Iago," (Iago salutes Aladdin) Good luck, kid..."
Setting, Forty Thieves Lair)
Fat White Man, The Forty Thieves down to seven. What are we to do?
 White Man, How did they find us? How did they learn the magic words? (The ground starts shaking) Another raid?
Triplets, Not again!
 Asian Man, (Standing and karate chopping) It is a good day to die!
luk, (From the entrance) Or to come back from the dead!
 White Man, Sa'luk?
Triplets, You're alive?
 Green Man, Impossible...
luk," I'm a survivor, like all of you. (Sa'luk puts his claws on) No thanks to Cassim."
 White Man, The King?
 Asian Man, You saw him?
 White Man, What's he want us to do now?
luk, He wants you to rot in the palace dungeon!
Triplets, (The triplets stand on top of each other) Bah... the King of Thieves is loyal to the end!
luk, (Sa'luk knocks them over) Pushovers!
Triplets, Ouch...
luk," He betrayed you, sold you out."
 Asian Man, You have always hated the King. Why should we believe you?
luk, How do you think the guard got the magic words?
 White Man, He told him the magic words?
Triplets, I don't believe it!
 White Man, Me neither!
luk, Ha! Ha! You have forgotten what life was like before Cassim.
luk, I remember a time when crime was sublime
 Asian Man, We used to be smart
 Green Man," Yes, horrendously heartless"
 White Man, In a ravaging raid we were rough!
Triplets, We knew that we had to be blissfully bad
Thieves, And we strayed from the path of our rigorous wrath.
luk, Double crossers or devout?
Thieves, Are you foe or friend?
luk, Here's the path I recommend
 White Man, We'll go robbing in all the right places
Triplets, From Agrabah dunes to Bali
 Green Man, Imagine the fear on their faces
 White Man, When we drop by for cookies and tea...
luk," Come along boys, follow me!"
Thieves, Yah!
luk, I'll lead you all the way into the glory days
Thieves, We'll begin a life of crime that pays (Omid wedgies Behrang and grabs the bag of money from his pants)
Triplet, Are you out or in?
luk," You can stick with me, or stay behind and pout"
Thieves, What's it gonna be?
luk, Consider carefully
Thieves, Are you in or out?
Setting, Outside the Forty Thieves' Lair)
Iago," I know the treasure's limitless. But I'm not crazy about a forty way split. If it was just uh, you and me..."
Cassim," I would never cut my men out of the deal. They're my family, my only family. I can always count on them."
Cassim, I'm home!
Iago, Why don't they look happy to see you?
luk," (Emerging from the crowd) We are, we're thrilled! (Sa'luk holds his claws out to Cassim)"
Setting, A Boat)
Cassim," Hurry, little friend."
Iago," I'm wriggling, I'm wriggling."
luk," I am growing impatient, Cassim. Ask the question."
Cassim, We must be ah...
Iago, Just a little further...
Cassim, Further out to sea...
luk," No, ask it now!"
Iago, (Almost free) Now's good.
Cassim, Where can we find the Hand of Midas?
Oracle, The Vanishing Isle will appear at dawn. I will show you the way... (A trail of light appears in the water)
Cassim," There's your setting, captain."
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah)
Sultan," Frankly, my boy, your actions were most disappointing."
Rasoul," It is tragic your highness, but the street rat has obviously followed in his father's footsteps. Aladdin is a criminal."
Genie," I object, your honor. (Genie turns the setting into a courtroom, with Sultan as the judge and Rasoul as the bailiff) I object to that outrageous statement. And I object to a tertiary character having any lines during my big courtroom scene. (Genie hands Rasoul a briefcase) Take this to a higher court, chow! (Genie blasts Rasoul out of the scene) Your honor, if I may enter a plea of insanity, because I'm crazy about this kid! (Genie messes up Aladdin's hair)"
Aladdin," (Pushes Genie away) Genie, I can handle this myself. Sultan, I convinced my father to come here. It was my fault. I would've been better off if I'd never known him."
Jasmine," Aladdin, you found your father. A father who risked his freedom to see your wedding. And you risked everything to save him. Just as I would for my father."
Sultan," Your father? (Softening) Well... well yes... Aladdin, I could not overlook your father's crimes, but what you have done, well, you did it out of love. And you came back to take responsibility for your actions. Let us put this matter behind us. I believe we have postponed the wedding long enough."
Genie," Okay, good call! Let's give a big hand for the wise and generous Sultan! (Sultan is led away by two large Genie hands)"
Iago, Al's dad... Sa'luk...
Jasmine," Just take a deep breath, Iago. Now what about Aladdin's father?"
Iago," It's Sa'luk, the guy Al beat. He's not beat, he's back. And he's got Cassim."
Aladdin, (Turning away from Iago) That's his problem. He chose to go back to that life...
Genie," Al, your dad's made a lot of bad choices, but that doesn't mean you have to."
Jasmine," He is your father, how can you do anything else?"
Aladdin, I'm being as stubborn as he was... (To Iago) Show me the way!
Setting," The Boat, Dawn)"
Oracle, You have arrived.
 White Man, Where is it?
 Asian Man, I see nothing. Nothing but fog!
luk, (Holding his claws out to Cassim) I've had enough of your trickery!
Cassim, No! This is it. The Vanishing Isle. Watch.
Setting, The Air)
Aladdin, The Vanishing Isle!
Jasmine, On the back of a giant turtle.
Aladdin, And never in the same place twice. Let's get closer.
Genie," (Dropping in on a parachute, dressed as Rambo) Prepare to rock and roll, dudes!"
Genie," (As a monk) I am here, (Genie, still as a monk, appears on the other side of the thieves) I am here."
Genie, (As a hillbilly) How 'bout a packet of Nutty Buddies? (Genie pushes the thief back with his stomach)
Aladdin," Genie, we need a distraction."
Genie," Survey says: Show me turtle! (Genie flies to the turtle. He is dressed as a wrestler) Boom! Another fake blow to the head. Boom! (As a wrestling announcer) Oh no! He's got'em in the half nelson. Now he's got'em in the full nelson. Oh no, the dreaded Ozzie Nelson! (As Ozzie Nelson) Rick, boys, maybe you want to come over here and see what's happening? (As the wrestling announcer, moving toward the turtle's mouth) He's coming in quick. Oh no, he's up, he's down, and he's actually inside the turtle! We'll be right back after a brief message. (Genie is now inside the turtle) Tickle, tickle, tickle!"
Aladdin, It took me years to find my father. I'm not losing him again!
Cassim, You came to help me? (Aladdin frees him)
Aladdin, How could I do anything else? Now let's get that treasure of yours.
Cassim, Amazing. (Cassim points upward) There! (A giant golden hand is floating in the sky)
Aladdin, Whoa! Feels like Genie got carried away!
Cassim, No! It's the Vanishing Isle! The turtle is diving! We must climb higher!
Cassim, Almost there! Can't you see Aladdin? We were meant to do this together! Come on!
Cassim, Pity I didn't find this place years ago. This would be much easier if I were much younger. (Cassim gets ready to jump to the floating hand. Aladdin jumps toward the hand) Aladdin!
Aladdin," See, it pays to have a junior partner!"
Cassim, Be careful! Don't touch the golden hand.
Aladdin," (Aladdin pulls on the Hand. It doesn't move. Aladdin turns it, and picks it up.) Heads up! (Aladdin throws the Hand to Cassim. Cassim catches it in his cape. It turns to gold.)"
Cassim," Ha ha! The Hand of Midas! (Cassim touches the base of the cavern with the hand. The entire cavern turns to solid gold.) Time to go, Aladdin!"
luk," Nobody's going anywhere. Give the Hand of Midas to me, Cassim, or your son dies."
Cassim," Sa'luk, your battle is with me!"
Aladdin," Don't worry, Dad, I can take 'em alone."
Cassim," But you're not alone. Not anymore. You want the Hand of Midas, Sa'luk? Take it! (Cassim throws the Hand of Midas to Sa'luk)"
luk," (Sa'luk catches the Hand) The Hand of Midas is mine! And also, the life of your brat. (To Aladdin) What are you staring at? (Sa'luk realizes that he caught the Hand of Midas by the golden part. He drops it.) no... no... No... NO... Ahhhh! (Aladdin winces as Sa'luk turns into a golden statue and falls into the sea. The water in the cavern has risen to the point where the floating hand is floating on top of the water. Aladdin takes the Hand of Midas and wraps his ripped off sleeve around it, turning it to gold.)"
Cassim," Hurry, son! We're running out of time."
Aladdin," Come on, Dad. You can do it!"
Cassim, Yes. But it would be a lot easier without this. (takes off the golden cape and drops it into the water.)
Aladdin," (Handing the Hand to Cassim) After all these years, you finally have your treasure."
Cassim," This thing? No. This retched thing almost cost me the Ultimate Treasure. It's you, son. You are my Ultimate Treasure. (hugs Aladdin) I'm just sorry it took me this long to realize it. The Hand of Midas can take its curse to the bottom of the sea! (throws the Hand of Midas over the edge of the island. It lands on the boat below, where the seven thieves are waiting to leave)"
 White Man, It's gold. It's turned everything to solid gold!
 White Man, We are sinking!
Iago," I didn't see where they went it, they could be anywhere!"
Jasmine, (Pointing to the top of the island) There they are!
Cassim, Get up here you blasted rug!
Aladdin, You actually trust this thing?
Cassim," With my life, son."
Aladdin, Genie?
Aladdin, Genie?
Genie, (Appears beside Carpet) Present!
Aladdin, Let's go home. We have some unfinished business.
Setting, The Palace of Agrabah; The Wedding Pavilion)
Sultan, Yes!
Iago, Out in the open? No mask? Pretty risky if you ask me.
Cassim," Even a wanted man can risk a bit to see his own son's wedding. (He gets down on one knee in front of Iago) So, you little turkey, come to say goodbye?"
Iago," Nah, I already said my goodbyes. Of course, the monkey had a cry, and that got me goin'... (Iago wipes a tear away from his eye)"
Cassim, You're not going to live in the palace?
Iago," With the newly weds? (Cassim jumps off the edge of the pavilion, and lands on top of his horse) It'll be too lovey dovey! I just as soon keep my will to live."
Cassim," Well, I don't know where I'm going, but you're welcome to come along for the ride."
Iago," (Iago lands on Cassim's shoulder) You're a good guy, Cassim, but not good. Ha Ha! (Cassim and Iago ride off)."
Merchant, So it goes short and sweet
Genie," Wait a minute. WE'RE NOT GETTING OUTTA HERE, MAN! WE'RE NOT GETTING OUTTA HERE! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND IT, MAN?! THIS IS IT, GAME'S OVER, MAN!"
Synopsis,"Conquering 90% of the known world by the age of 25, Alexander the Great led his armies through 22,000 miles of sieges and conquests in just eight years. Coming out of tiny Macedonia (today part of Greece), Alexander led his armies against the mighty Persian Empire, drove west to Egypt, and finally made his way east to India. This film will concentrate on those eight years of battles, as well as his relationship with his boyhood friend and battle mate, Hephaestion. Alexander died young, of illness, at 33. Alexander's conquests paved the way for the spread of Greek culture (facilitating the spread of Christianity centuries later), and removed many of the obstacles that might have prevented the expansion of the Roman Empire. In other words, the world we know today might never have been if not for Alexander's bloody, yet unifying, conquest."

Chorus," Alice in Wonderland, how do you get to Wonderland?"
Sister," …for if he does, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him, and even Stigand… (noticed Alice's foot and moves it) Alice!"
Alice," Hmm…? Oh, I’m listening."
Sister," And even Stigand, the archbishop of Canterbury, agreed to meet with William and offer him the crown."
Alice, Hihihi!
Sister, William’s conduct at first was mo… (the flowers land on her)
Alice, Hihihi!
Sister, Alice…! (takes flowers off her) Will you kindly pay attention to your history lesson?
Alice," I’m sorry, but how can one possibly pay attention to a book with no pictures in it?"
Sister," My dear child, there are a great many good books in this world without pictures."
Alice," In this world perhaps. But in my world, the books would be nothing but pictures."
Sister," Your world? Huh, what nonsense. Now…"
Alice, Nonsense?
Sister, Once more. From the beginning.
Alice," That’s it, Dinah! If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn’t. And contrariwise, what it is, it wouldn’t be, and what it wouldn’t be, it would. You see?"
Dinah, Meow!
Alice," (climbs down tree) In my world, you wouldn’t say ‘meow’. You’d say ‘Yes, miss Alice’."
Dinah, Meow!
Alice," (picks up Dinah) Oh, but you would! You’d be just like people, Dinah, and all the other animals too. Why, in my world… (sings) Cats and rabbits, would reside in fancy little houses, and be dressed in shoes and hats and trousers. In a world of my own. All the flowers would have very extra special powers, they would sit and talk to me for hours, when I’m lonely in a world of my own. There’d be new birds, lots of nice and friendly howdy-do birds, everyone would have a dozen bluebirds, within that world of my own. I could listen to a babbling brook and hear a song, that I could understand. I keep wishing it could be that way, because my world would be a wonderland."
Dinah, Meow! Meow! Meow!
Alice, Oh Dinah! Its just a rabbit with a waistcoat… (surprised) and a watch!
White Rabbit," (looks at watch) Oh my fur and whiskers! I’m late, I’m late I’m late! (hops off)"
Alice," Now this is curious! What could a rabbit possibly be late for? (follows rabbit) Please, sir!"
White Rabbit," (continues hopping) I’m late, I’m late, for a very important date! No time to say hello, goodbye! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!"
Alice," It must be awfully important, like a party or something! Mister Rabbit! Wait!"
White Rabbit," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I’m overdue. I’m really in a stew. No time to say goodbye, hello! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! (jumps down rabbit hole)"
Alice," My, what a peculiar place to have a party."
Dinah, Meow!
Alice," You know, Dinah, we really shouldn’t…uhh…uhh…be doing this. After all, we haven’t been invited! And curiosity often leads to troubl-l-l-e-e!"
Alice," Goodbye, Dinah! Goodbye!"
Alice," Oh! Well, after this I shall think nothing of fa-… (pushes apron off her face) of falling downstairs!"
Alice," Oh! (relaxed in chair) Ahhh… then slips off chair) Oh, Goodness! What if I should fall right through the center of the earth… (falls through a tight opening) oh, and come out the other side, where people walk upside down. Oh, but that’s silly. Nobody… (she stops falling and is upside down, then she spotted the rabbit) oh! Oh, ha ha. (she got herself right side up) Oh, mister Rabbit! Wait! Please! …"
Alice, Curiouser and curiouser!
Doorknob, Ohhhhh!!
Alice," Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon."
Doorknob," Oh, oh, it’s quite all right. But you did give me quite a turn!"
Alice," You see, I was following…"
Doorknob," Rather good, what? Doorknob, turn?"
Alice," Please, sir."
Doorknob," Well, one good turn deserves another! What can I do for you?"
Alice," Well, I’m looking for a white rabbit. So, um, if you don’t mind…"
Doorknob, Uh? Oh!
Alice, There he is! I simply must get through!
Doorknob," Sorry, you’re much too big. Simply impassible."
Alice, You mean impossible?
Doorknob," No, impassible. Nothing’s impossible! Why don’t you try the bottle on the table?"
Alice, Table? Oh!
Doorknob," Read the directions, and directly you’ll be directed in the right direction. He he he!"
Alice," ‘Drink me’. Hmmm, better look first. For if one drinks much from a bottle marked ‘poison’, it’s almost certain to disagree with one, sooner or later."
Doorknob, Beg your pardon!
Alice," I was just giving myself some good advice. But… hmm, tastes like oh… cherry tart… custard… pineapple… roast turkey… goodness! What did I do?"
Doorknob, Ho ho ho ho! You almost went out like a candle!
Alice, But look! I’m just the right size!
Doorknob," Oh, no use! Ha ha ha ha. I forgot to tell you, ho ho ho ho! I’m locked!"
Alice, Oh no!
Doorknob," Ha ha ha, but of course, uh, you’ve got the key, so…"
Alice, What key?
Doorknob," Now, don’t tell me you’ve left it up there!"
Alice," Oh, dear! What ever will I do?"
Doorknob," Try the box, naturally."
Alice," Oh! ‘Eat me’. All right. But goodness knows what this will do… wow, wow, wow, wow, wow!"
Doorknob, whtwhsthswwdthdwd!
Alice, What did you say?
Doorknob, I said: ‘a little of that went a long way’! Ha ha ha ha!
Alice," Well, I don’t think it’s so funny! Now- now I shall never get home!"
Doorknob," Oh, come on now. Crying won’t help."
Alice," I know, but I- I- I just can’t help myself!"
Doorknob," Hey, this won’t do! Bwbwlwbbwlwbl! Say, this won’t do at all! You, you up there, stop! Stop, I say! Oh look! The bottle, the bottle…"
Alice," Oh dear, I do wish I hadn’t cried so much."

Parrot," Where away, Dodo?"
Alice, Dodo?
Dodo," Three points to starboard. Follow me, me hearties! Have you at port no time at all now, haha! Oh…"
Alice, Mister Dodo!
Dodo," Johoho, and a bottle of sea, we love each time…"
Alice," Please! Please help me! … Um, pardon me, but uh, would you mind helping me? Please? Yoo Ho! Yoo Ho! Help me! Please! Help me!"
Dodo," Forward, backward, inward, outward, come and join the chase! Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus-race. Backward, forward, outward, inward, bottom to the top, never a beginning there can never be a stop to skipping, hopping, tripping, fancy free and gay, I started it tomorrow and will finish yesterday. Round and round and round we go, and dance for evermore, once we were behind but now we find we are be-forward, backward, inward, outward, come and join the chase! Nothing could be drier than a jolly caucus-race. For backward…I say! You’ll never get dry that way!"
Alice, Get dry?
Dodo," Have to run with the others! First rule of a caucus-race, you know!"
Alice, But how can I…
Dodo, That’s better! Have you dry in no time now!
Alice, No-one can ever get dry this way!
Dodo, Nonsense! I am as dry as a bone already.
Alice," Yes, but…"
Dodo," All right, chaps! Let’s head now! Look lively!"
Alice, The white rabbit! Mister Rabbit! Mi- mister Rabbit!
White Rabbit," Oh, my goodness! I’m late! I’m late!"
Alice," Oh, don’t go away! I’ll be right back!"
White Rabbit," I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!"
Dodo," Don’t step on the fish! Eric, there, watch it there stop kicking that mackerel! William…"
Alice," Mister Rabbit! Oh, mister Rabbit! Oh dear, I’m sure he came this way. Do you suppose he could be hiding? Hmmm… not here. I wonder… No, I suppose he must have… Oh! Why, what peculiar little figures! Tweedle Dee… and Tweedle Dum!"
Tweedle Dee," If you think we’re wax-works, you ought to pay, you know!"
Tweedle Dum," Contrariwise, if you think we’re alive you ought to speak to us!"
 Dum, That’s logic!
Alice," Well, it’s been nice meeting you. Goodbye!"
Dee, You’re beginning backwards!
Dum," Aye, the first thing in a visit is to say: How do you do and shake hands, shake hands, shake hands. How do you do and shake hands and state your name and business."
 Dum, That’s manners!
Alice," Really? Well, my name is Alice and I’m following a white rabbit. So…"
Dee, You can’t go yet!
Dum," No, the visit has just started!"
Alice, I’m very sorry…
Dum, Do you like to play hide-and-seek?
Dee," Or button-button, who’s got the button?"
Alice," No, thank you."
Dee, If you stay long enough we might have a battle!
Alice," That’s very kind of you, but I must be going."
 Dum, Why?
Alice, Because I am following a white rabbit!
 Dum, Why?
Alice," Well, I- I’m curious to know where he is going!"
Dum," Ohhhh, she’s curious! Tsk! tsk! tsk! ts!…"
Dee," The oysters were curious too, weren’t they?"
Dum," Aye, and you remember what happened to them…"
 Dum, Poor things!
Alice, Why? What did happen to the oysters?
Dee," Oh, you wouldn’t be interested."
Alice, But I am!
Dum," Oh, no. You’re in much too much of a hurry!"
Alice," Well, perhaps I could spare a little time…"
 Dum, You could? Well…
Dee, ‘The Walrus and the Carpenter’!
Dum, Or: ‘The story of the curious Oysters’!
 Dum," The sun was shining on the sea, shining with all his might, he did his very best to make the billows smooth and bright. And this was odd, because it was the middle of the night. The Walrus and the Carpenter were walking close at hand. The beach was white from side to side but much too full of sand. ‘Mister Walrus’, said the Carpenter: ‘My brain begins to perk. We’ll sweep this clear in half a year, if you don’t mind the work.’"
Walrus," Work? Uh, pff, brrrr! Uh the time has come…"
 Dum, …the Walrus said…
Walrus," …to talk of other things. Of shoes and ships and sealing wax, and cabbages and kings. And why the sea is boiling hot, and whether pigs have wings. Callooh, callay, no work today! We’re cabbages and kings! … Oh, uhhh, oysters, come and walk with us. The day is warm and bright! A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk, would be a sheer delight!"
Carpenter," Yes, and should we get hungry on the way, we’ll stop and uh… have a bite!"
Walrus, Hrmmmm!
 Dum, But mother Oyster winked her eye and shook her heavy head. She knew too well this was no time to leave her oyster bed.
Mother oyster," The sea is nice, take my advice, and stay right here."
 Dum, Mom said.
Walrus," Yes, yes, of course, of course! But eh… haha! The time has come, my little friends, to talk of other"
Carpenter," So how about some pepper and salt and vinegar, aye?"
Walrus," Oh yes, yes, splendid idea! Haha, very good indeed! Now, if you’re ready, oysters dear… haha… we can begin the feed."
Oysters, Feed?
Walrus," Oh yes, ahh, the time has come, my little friends, to talk of food and things!"
Carpenter," Of peppercorn some mustard seed and other seasonings. We’ll mix them all together in a sauce that’s fit for kings. Callooh, callay, we’ll eat today, like cabbages and kings!"
Walrus," I uh, weep for you, I -uh- oh, excuse me, I deeply sympathize. For I’ve enjoyed your company, oh, much more than you realize."
Carpenter," Little oysters, little oysters…"
 Dum," But answer there came none. And this was scarcely odd, because, they’d been eaten, every one!"
Walrus," Hmm, well, uhhh, ha ha, ha ha, ha ha, hmm… the time has come!"
 Dum, We’re cabbages and kings! The end!
Alice, That was a very sad story.
Dum," Aye, and there’s a moral to it."
Alice," Oh yes, a very good moral, if you happen to be an oyster. Well, it’s been a very nice visit…"
Dum, Another recitation…
Alice," I’m sorry, but…"
Dum, Its titled ‘Father William’.
Alice," But really, I’m…"
Dum," First verse: You are old father William, the young man said and your hair has become very white. And yet you incessantly stand on your head, do you think at your age it is right, is right, do you think at your age it is right? Well, in me youth, father William replied to his son, I’d do it again and again and again and I’d done it again and again and again…"
Alice, Now I wonder who lives here…
White Rabbit, Mary Ann! Drat that girl. Where did she put ’em? Mary Ann!
Alice, The rabbit!
White Rabbit," Mary Ann! No use, can’t wait, I’m awfully late, oh me oh my oh me oh my!"
Alice," Excuse me sir, but- but I’ve been trying to…"
White Rabbit," Why, Mary Ann! What are you doing out here?"
Alice, Mary Ann?
White Rabbit, Don’t just do something stand there! Uh… no no! Go go! Go get my gloves! I’m late!
Alice, But late for what? That’s just what I…
White Rabbit," My gloves! At once, do you hear!"
Alice," Goodness. I suppose I’ll be taking orders from Dinah next. Hmmm, now let me see. If I were a rabbit, where would I keep my gloves? Oh! Thank you. Don’t mind if I do. Hmhm. Hmhm. Hmhmhmhmhmhm. Hmhmhmhmhmhm-oeh! Oh no no, not again!"
White Rabbit," Oh! Mary Ann! Now you see here, Mary Ann… Help! No! No! Help! Monsters! Help,"
Alice, Hrmm… hrmm… hrmm… dear!
White Rabbit," A monster! A monster, Dodo! In my house, Dodo!"
Alice, Dodo…?
White Rabbit," Oh might, poor little bitty house…"
Dodo," Uh, steady old champ.Can’t be as bad as all that you know."
White Rabbit," Oh my poor roof and rafters, all my walls and… there it is!"
Dodo, By Jove! Jolly well?? is! Isn’t it?
White Rabbit," Well, do something, Dodo!"
Dodo," Yes, indeed! Extraordinary situation, but eh…"
White Rabbit, But- but- but- but- but what?
Dodo, But I have a very simple solution!
Alice, Thank goodness!
White Rabbit, Wha- wha- what is it?
Dodo, Simply pull it out the chimney.
White Rabbit," Yes, go- go- go on, go on! Pull it out!"
Dodo, Who? Me? Don’t be ridiculous! What we need is eh… a lizard with a ladder!
White Rabbit," Hmm? Oh! Bill! Bill! Eh, we need a lazzerd with a lizard, a lizard a bb…b… can you help us?"
Bill," At your service, governor!"
Dodo," Here, my lad??. Have you ever been down a chimney?"
Bill," Why governor, I’ve been down more chimneys…"
Dodo," Excellent, excellent. You just pop down the chimney, and haul that monster out of there."
Bill," Righto, governor! Monster? Hoeaaaaah! No! No! …."
Dodo," Steady now. That’s better! Bill, lad, you’re passing up a golden opportunity!"
Bill, I am?
Dodo, You can be famous!
Bill, I can?
Dodo," Of course! There’s a brave lad! In you go now. Nothing to it, old boy. Simply tie your tail around the monsters neck and drag it out!"
Bill, But- but- but governor!
Dodo," Good luck, Bill!"
Alice, (Prepares to Sneeze (Earthquake Rumble Shake Vibrate)) (Sneezes (Earthquake Rumble Shake Vibrate)).
Dodo," Well, there goes Bill…"
Alice, Poor Bill…
Dodo," Ehh, perhaps we should try a more energetic remedy."
White Rabbit," Yes, anything, anything. But hurry!"
Dodo," Now, I- I propose that we… uhh…"
White Rabbit," Yes, come on, come on, yes, yes…"
Dodo, I propose that we… uhh… dow! By Jove! That’s it! We’ll burn the house down!
White Rabbit," Yes, hihi! Burn the house… what?"
Alice, Oh no!
Dodo," Hi ho! Oh, we’ll smoke the blighter out. He’ll put the beast to rout. Some kindling, a stick or two, all this bit of rubbish ought to do."
White Rabbit, Oh dear…
Dodo," We’ll smoke the blighter out, we’ll smoke the monster out!"
White Rabbit," No, no! Not my beautiful birdhouse!"
Dodo," Oh, we’ll roast the blighter’s toes, we’ll toast the bounder’s nose! Just fetch that gate, we’ll make it clear that monsters aren’t welcome here."
White Rabbit," Oh me, oh my…"
Dodo, A match!
White Rabbit, Match?
Dodo," Thank you! We’ll blow the thing there out, we’ll smoke the monster out!"
White Rabbit," We’ll smoke the monster out… noho! Noho, my poor house and furniture…"
Alice," Oh dear, this is serious! I simply must… oh! A garden! Perhaps if I eat something it will make me grow smaller…"
White Rabbit," Ahhhh! Oh, let go! Help!"
Alice," I’m sorry, but I must eat something!"
White Rabbit," Not me, you- you- you- you- you barbarian! Help! Monsters! Help! Ah! I’m late! Oh dear, I’m here, I should be there! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!"
Dodo," Ah, say, do you have a match?"
White Rabbit," Must go. Goodbye. Hello. I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!"
Alice, Wait! Please wait!
Dodo," Ah, young lady! Do you have a match?"
Alice," No, I- I’m sorry, but… mister Rabbit!"
Dodo," No cooperation, no cooperation at all? We can’t have monsters about! Jolly will have to carry on alone! Pf, pf, pf, pf…"
Alice," Wait! Please! Just a minute! Oh, dear. I’ll never catch him while I’m this small. Why curious butterflies!"
Rose, You mean bread-and-butterflies.
Alice," Oh, yes, of course, I… hmm? Now who do you suppose… Ah, a horse fly! I mean, a- a rocking horse fly!"
Rose, Naturally!
Alice," I beg your pardon, but uhh… did you… oh, that’s nonsense. Flowers can’t talk."
Rose," But of course we can talk, my dear."
Iris, If there’s anyone worth talking to.
Daisy, Or about! Hahahaha!
Pansies, And we sing too!
Alice, You do?
Tulips," Oh, yes. Would you like to hear ‘Tell it to the tulips’?"
Violets, We know one about the shy little violets…
st Lily," Oh, no, not that old thing!"
nd Lily, Let’s do ‘Lovely lily at the valley’!
Daisies, How about the daisies in the…
Lilac," Oh, she wouldn’t like that!"
Rose," Girls, girls! We shall sing: ‘Golden afternoon’. That’s about all of us! Sound your A, Lily!"
Lily, Laaaa…
Pansies, Mimimimi…
Daisy, Lalalala…
Iris, Hahahahahahaha…
Dandelions," Poem, poem poem, poem poem poem poem poem…."
All flowers," Little bread-and-butterflies kiss the tulips, and the sun is like a toy balloon. There are get up in the morning glories, in the golden afternoon. There are dizzy daffodils on the hillside, strings of violets are all in tune, Tiger lilies love the dandelions, in the golden afternoon, the golden afternoon. There are dog and caterpillars and a copper centipede, where the lazy daisies love the very peaceful life they lead… You can learn a lot of things from the flowers, for especially in the month of June. There’s a wealth of happiness and romance, all in the golden afternoon. … All in the golden afternoon, the golden afternoon…"
Alice," You can learn a lot of things from the flowers, for especially in the month of June. There’s a wealth of happiness and romance, all…"
Pansies, in
Alice and Flowers, …the golden afternoon!
Alice," Oh, that was lovely."
Rose," Thank you, my dear."
Daisy, What kind of garden do you come from?
Alice, Well I don’t come from any garden…
Daisy," Oh, do you suppose she’s a wild flower?"
Alice," Oh no, I’m not a wild flower…"
Rose," Just what specie, or shall we say, genus, are you, my dear?"
Alice," Well, I suppose you call me a genus, humanus, eh… Alice!"
Daisy, Ever seen an Alice with a blossom like that?
Iris," Come to think of it, did you ever see an Alice?"
Daisy," Yes, and did you notice her petals? What a peculiar color!"
Iris, And no fragrance!
Daisy, Hahaha! Just look at those stems!
Iris," Rather scrawny, I’d say."
Rose bud, I think she’s pretty!
Rose," Quiet, bud!"
Alice, But I’m not a flower!
Iris, Aha! Just as I suspected! She’s nothing but a common mobile vulgaris!
Flowers, Oh no!
Alice, A common what?
Iris, To put it bluntly: a weed!
Alice, I’m not a weed!
Tulip," Well, you wouldn’t expect her to admit it."
Lilac, Can you imagine!
Daisy," Well, goodness!"
Lily, Don’t let her stay here and go to seed!
Rose," Please, girls…"
Pansies, We don’t want weeds in our bed!
Other flower," Move along, move along!"
Alice," Oh, all right, if that’s the way you feel about it. If I were my right size, I could pick every one of you if I wanted to! And I’d guess that’d teach you!"
Flowers, Hihihi!
Alice, You can learn a lot of things from the flowers… Huh! Seems to me they could learn a few things about manners!
Caterpillar," A, e i o u, a e i o u, a e i o u, o, u e i o a, u e i a, a e i o u… Who are you?"
Alice," I- I- I hardly know, sir. I changed so many times since this morning, you see…"
Caterpillar, I do not see. Explain yourself.
Alice," Why, I’m afraid I can’t explain myself, sir, because I’m not myself, you know…"
Caterpillar, I do not know.
Alice," Well, I can’t put it anymore clearly for it isn’t clear to me!"
Caterpillar, You? Who are you?
Alice," Well, don’t you think you ought to tell me- cough-cough, cough-cough, who you are first?"
Caterpillar, Why?
Alice, Oh dear. Everything is so confusing.
Caterpillar, It is not.
Alice," Well, it is to me."
Caterpillar, Why?
Alice," Well, I can’t remember things as I used to, and…"
Caterpillar, Recite.
Alice," Hmm? Oh! Oh, oh, yes, sir! Um… how doth the little busy bee, improve each shi…"
Caterpillar, Stop! That is not spoken correcitically. It goes: how…
Alice, Hihihi!
Caterpillar," Hmm! How doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail. And pour the waters of the Nile, on every golden scale. How cheer… how cheer… Ahem!"
Alice, Hihihihi!
Caterpillar," How cheerfully he seems to grin, how neatly spreads his claws. And welcomes little fishes in, with gently smiling jaws."
Alice, Well I must say I’ve never heard it that way before…
Caterpillar," I know, I have improved it."
Alice," Well, cough-cough-couch, if you ask me…"
Caterpillar," You? Huh, who are you?"
Alice," Cough-cough, cough-cough, A-choo! Oh!"
Caterpillar, You there! Girl! Wait! Come back! I have something important to say!
Alice, Oh dear. I wonder what he wants now. Well…?
Caterpillar, Keep your temper!
Alice, Is that all?
Caterpillar," No. Exacitically, what is your problem?"
Alice," Well, it’s exacitici-, exaciti-, well, it’s precisely this: I should like to be a little larger, sir."
Caterpillar, Why?
Alice," Well, after all, three inches is such a wretched height, and…"
Caterpillar," I am exacitically three inches high, and it is a very good height indeed!"
Alice, But I’m not used to it. And you needn’t shout! Oh dear!
Caterpillar," By the way, I have a few more helpful hints. One side will make you grow taller…"
Alice, One side of what?
Caterpillar, …and the other side will make you grow shorter.
Alice, The other side of what?
Caterpillar," The mushroom, of course!"
Alice," Hmm. One side will make me grow… but which is which? Hmm. After all that’s happened, I- I wonder if I… I don’t care. I’m tired of being only three inches high -yi -yi -yi -yi -yi!"
Bird, (gasps) A serpent! (screams) Help! Serpent! Serpent!
Alice," Oh, but please! Please!"
Bird, Off with you! Shoo! Shoo! Go away! Serpent! Serpent!
Alice, But I’m not a serpent!
Bird, So? Indeed? Then just what are you?
Alice, I’m just a little girl!
Bird," Little? Ha, little? (laughs)"
Alice," Well I am! I mean, I- I was…"
Bird," And, I suppose you don’t eat eggs, either?"
Alice," Yes, I do, but…"
Bird, I knew!
Alice, But- but- but…
Bird, I knew it! Serpent! Serpent!
Alice," Oh, for goodness sake! Hmmm… and the other side will…"
Bird," A very idea! Spend all my time lying eggs, for serpents like her! (screams) Oh, Oh, oh, oh!"
Alice," Goodness… I wonder if I’ll ever get the knack of it. There, that’s much better. Hmmm… I better save these. Now let’s see, where was I? Hmmm, I wonder which way I ought to go…"
Cheshire Cat," ‘Twas brillig, and the slithy toves, did gyre and gimble in the wabe. All mimsy were the borogoves, and the momeraths outgrabe."
Alice, Now where in the world do you suppose that…
Cheshire Cat, Uh… lose something?
Alice," Oh! Hehe, Oh uhhh… hehe… I- I was… no, no, I- I- I- I mean, I uhh… I was just wondering…"
Cheshire Cat," Oh uhh, that’s quite all right! Oh, hrmm, one moment please… Oh! Second chorus… ‘Twas brilllig, and the slithy toves, did gyre and gimble in the wabe…"
Alice," Why, why you’re a cat!"
Cheshire Cat, A Cheshire Cat. All mimsy were the borogoves…
Alice," Oh, wait! Don’t go, please!"
Cheshire Cat, Very well. Third chorus…
Alice," Oh no no no… thank you, but- but I just wanted to ask you which way I ought to go."
Cheshire Cat," Well, that depends on where you want to get to."
Alice," Oh, it really doesn’t matter, as long as I g…"
Cheshire Cat," Then it really doesn’t matter which way you go! Ah-hmm… and the momeraths outgrabe… Oh, by the way, if you’d really like to know, he went that way."
Alice, Who did?
Cheshire Cat, The white rabbit.
Alice, He did?
Cheshire Cat, He did what?
Alice, Went that way?
Cheshire Cat, Who did?
Alice, The white rabbit!
Cheshire Cat, What rabbit?
Alice, But didn’t you just say… I mean… oh dear!
Cheshire Cat, Can you stand on your head?
Alice, Oh!
Cheshire Cat," However, if I were looking for a white rabbit, I’d ask the Mad Hatter."
Alice," The Mad Hatter? Uh… no, no, I don’t- I don’t…"
Cheshire Cat," Or, there’s the March Hare. In that direction."
Alice," Oh, thank you. I- I think I shall visit him."
Cheshire Cat," Of course, he’s mad too."
Alice, But I don’t want to go among mad people!
Cheshire Cat," Oh, you can’t help that. Almost everyone is mad here. Ha… ha ha ha ha ha! You may have noticed that I’m not all there myself…. hahaha… and the momeraths outgrabe…"
Alice," Goodness. If the people here are like that, I- I must try not to upset them. How very curious!"
March Hare," …to us. If there are no objections, let it be unanimous!"
Mad Hatter, A very merry unbirthday…
March Hare, A very merry unbirthday…
 March Hare, A very merry unbirthday to us! …
March Hare, A very merry unbirthday to me.
Mad Hatter, To who?
March Hare, To me.
Mad Hatter, Oh you!
March Hare, A very merry unbirthday to you.
Mad Hatter," Who, me?"
March Hare," Yes, you."
Mad Hatter, Oh me!
March Hare," Let’s all congratulate us with another cup of tea, a very merry unbirthday to you!"
 Mad Hatter," No room, no room, no room, no room, no room, no room, no room!"
Alice, But I thought there was plenty of room!
March Hare," Ah, but it’s very rude to sit down without being invited!"
Mad Hatter," I say it’s rude. Its very very rude, indeed! Hah!"
Dormouse," Very very very rude, indeed…"
Alice," Oh, I’m very sorry, but I did enjoy your singing and I wondered if you could tell me…"
March Hare, You enjoyed our singing?
Mad Hatter," Oh, what a delightful child! Hah! I’m so excited, we never get compliments! You must have a cup of tea!"
March Hare," Ah, yes indeed! The tea, you must have a cup of tea!"
Alice," That would be very nice. I’m sorry I interrupted your birthdayparty… uh, thank you."
March Hare," Birthday? Hahaha! My dear child, this is not a birthdayparty!"
Mad Hatter, Of course not! Hehehe! This is an unbirthdayparty!
Alice," Unbirthday? Why, I’m sorry, but I don’t quite understand."
March Hare," Its very simple. Now, thirty days have sept- no, when… an unbirthday, if you have a birthday then you… haha… she doesn’t know what an unbirthday is!"
Mad Hatter," How silly! Ha ha ha ha! Ah-hum… I shall elucidate! Now statistics prove, prove that you’ve one birthday."
March Hare," Imagine, just one birthday every year."
Mad Hatter," Ahhh, but there are 364 unbirthdays!"
March Hare, Precisely why we’re gathered here to cheer!
Alice," Why, then today is my unbirthday too!"
March Hare, It is?
Mad Hatter, What a small world this is.
March Hare, In that case… a very merry unbirthday.
Alice, To me?
Mad Hatter, To you!
March Hare, A very merry unbirthday.
Alice, For me?
Mad Hatter," For you! Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true! Hihihi!"
 Mad hatter, A very merry unbirthday to you!
Dormouse," Twinkle, twinkle, little bat, how I wonder what you’re at! Up above the world you fly, like a tea-tray in the sky!"
Alice," Oh, that was lovely!"
Mad Hatter," And uh, and now my dear, hehe, uh… you were saying that you would like to sea.. uh…? You were seaking some information some kind… hehe!"
Alice," Oh, yes. You see, I’m looking for a…"
Mad Hatter," Clean cup, clean cup! Move down!"
Alice, But I haven’t used my cup!
March Hare," Clean cup, clean cup, move down, move down, clean cup, clean cup, move down!"
Mad Hatter, Would you like a little more tea?
Alice," Well, I haven’t had any yet, so I can’t very well take more…"
March Hare," Ahh, you mean you can’t very well take less!"
Mad Hatter, Yes! You can always take more than nothing!
Alice, But I only meant that…
Mad Hatter," And now, my dear, something seems to be troubling you. Uh, won’t you tell us all about it?"
March Hare, Start at the beginning.
Mad Hatter," Yes, yes! And when you come to the end, hehehe, stop! See?"
Alice," Well, it all started while I was sitting on the riverbank with Dinah."
March Hare, Very interesting. Who’s Dinah?
Alice," Why, Dinah is my cat. You see…"
Dormouse, Cat?
March Hare, Hurry! Give the jam! Quickly! Give the jam! On his nose! Put it on his nose!
Mad Hatter," On his nose, on his nose!"
Dormouse, Where’s the cat…
Mad Hatter," Oh. Oh, my goodness! Those are the things that upset me!"
March Hare, See all the trouble you’ve started?
Alice," But really, I didn’t think…"
March Hare," Ah, but that’s the point! If you don’t think, you shouldn’t talk!"
Mad Hatter," Clean cup! Clean cup! Move down, move down, move down!"
Alice, But I still haven’t used….
March Hare," Move down, move down, move down, move down… "
Mad Hatter," And now my dear, as you were saying?"
Alice," Oh, yes. I was sitting on the riverbank with uh… with you know who…"
Mad Hatter," I do, hehehe?"
Alice, I mean my C – A – T…
Mad Hatter, Tea?
March Hare, Just half a cup if you don’t mind.
Mad Hatter," Come, come my dear. hehehe! Don’t you care for tea?"
Alice," Why, yes, I’m very fond of tea, but…"
March Hare," If you don’t care for tea, you could at least make polite conversation!"
Alice," Well, I’ve been trying to ask you…"
March Hare, I have an excellent idea! Let’s change the subject!
Mad Hatter, Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Alice, Riddles? Let me see now. Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Mad Hatter, I beg your pardon?
Alice, Why is a raven like a writing desk?
Mad Hatter, Why is a what?
March Hare, Careful! She’s stark raving mad!
Alice, But- but it’s your silly riddle! You just said…
Mad Hatter, Very good??!
March Hare, How about a nice cup of tea?
Alice," A nice cup of tea, indeed! Well, I’m sorry, but I just haven’t the time!"
March Hare," The time, the time! Who’s got the time?"
White Rabbit," No, no, no, no! No time, no time, no time! Hello, goodbye! I’m late! I’m late!"
Alice, The white rabbit!
White Rabbit," Oh, I’m so late! I’m so very very late!"
Mad Hatter," Well, no wonder you’re late! Why, this clock is exactly two days slow!"
White Rabbit, Two days slow?
Mad Hatter," Of course you’re late. Hahaha! My goodness. We’ll have to look into this. A-ha! I see what’s wrong with it! Why, this watch is full of wheels!"
White Rabbit," Oh, my poor watch! Oh, my wheels! My springs! But- but- but- but, but- but- but…"
Mad Hatter," Butter! Of course, we need some butter! Butter!"
March Hare, Butter!
White Rabbit, But- but- butter?
Mad Hatter," Butter, oh, thank you, butter. Ha ha. Yes, that’s fine."
White Rabbit," Oh no no, no no no you’ll get crumbs in it!"
Mad Hatter," Oh, this is the very best butter! What are you talking about?"
March Hare, Tea?
Mad Hatter," Tea! Oh, I never thought of tea! Of course!"
White Rabbit, No!
Mad Hatter, Tea! hehehe
White Rabbit, No! Not tea!
March Hare, Sugar?
Mad Hatter," Sugar. Two spoons, yes, ha, two spoons. Thank you, yes."
White Rabbit," Oh, please! Be careful!"
March Hare, Jam?
Mad Hatter, Jam! I forgot all about jam!
White Rabbit," No, no! Not jam!"
Mad Hatter," Yes, sure you want, it’s nice to see."
March Hare, Mustard?
Mad Hatter," Mustard? Yes, but… Mustard? Don’t let’s be silly! Lemon, that’s different, that’s… yes! That should do it. Hahaha! … (The watch rings and goes mad) Look at that!"
March Hare, Its going mad!
Alice," Oh, my goodness!"
White Rabbit, Oh dear!
March Hare, It is going mad! Mad watch!
Mad Hatter," I don’t understand, it’s the best butter."
March Hare, Mad watch! Mad watch! Mad watch!
Mad Hatter," Oh, look! Oh my goodness!"
March hare," There’s only one way to stop a mad watch! (The March Hare smashes the watch with a mallet, destroying it completely.)"
Mad Hatter," Two days slow, that’s what it is."
White Rabbit," Oh, my watch…"
Mad Hatter, It was?
White Rabbit, And it was an unbirthday present too.
March Hare," Well, in that case…"
 Mad Hatter, A very merry unbirthday to you!
Alice," Mister Rabbit! Oh, mister Rabbit! Oh, now where did he go to?"
 Mad Hatter," A very merry unbirthday to us, to us. A very merry unbirthday to us, to us…"
Alice," Of all the silly nonsense, this is the stupidest tea party I’ve ever been to in all my life. Well, I’ve had enough nonsense. I’m going home. Straight home. That rabbit. Who cares where he’s going anyway. Why, if it hadn’t been for him I… ‘Tulgey Wood’… Hmm, curious. I don’t remember this. Now let me see… Oh! Uh, no no, please. No more nonsense. Now, if I came this way, I should go back this way!"
Duck, Quack!
Alice," Oh, I beg your pardon!"
Duck, Quack quack quack quack! …
Alice," Goodness. When I get home I shall write a book about this place… If I- if I ever do get home… Oh, um, excuse me! Um, could one of you tell me… uh… ha ha, never mind. Oh dear. Its getting dreadfully dark. And nothing looks familiar. I shall certainly be glad to get out of… Oh! … It would be so nice if something would make sense for a change! Oh! ‘Don’t step on the momeraths’. The momeraths? Oh! A path! Oh thank goodness! Why, I just knew I’d find one sooner or later. Oh, if I hurry back I might even be home in time for tea! Oh, won’t Dinah be happy to see me! Oh, I just can’t wait ’till I- oh! Oh dear! Now I- now I shall never get out. Well, when- when one’s lost, I- I suppose it’s good advice to stay where you are, until someone finds you. But- but who’d ever think to look for me here? Good advice. If I listened earlier I wouldn’t be here! But that’s just the trouble with me. I give myself very good advice… but I very seldom follow it. That explains the trouble that I’m always in. Be patient is very good advice, but the waiting makes me curious. And I’d love the change, should something strange begin. Well, I went along my merry way, and I never stopped to reason. I should have known there’d be a price to pay, some day. Some day. I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it. Will I ever learn to do the things I should?"
Chorus," Will I ever learn, learn to do the things I should?"
Cheshire Cat, Hmhmhmhm… and the momeraths outgrabe.
Alice," Oh, Cheshire Cat, it’s you!"
Cheshire Cat," Whom did you expect? The white rabbit, perchance?"
Alice," Oh, no no no no. I- I- I’m through with rabbits. I want to go home! But I can’t find my way."
Cheshire Cat," Naturally. That’s because you have no way. All ways here you see, are the queen’s ways."
Alice, But I’ve never met any queen.
Cheshire Cat," You haven’t? You haven’t? Oh, but you must! She’ll be mad about you, simply mad! Hahaha! And the momeraths outgrabe…"
Alice," Please, please! Uh… how can I find her?"
Cheshire Cat," Well, some go this way, some go that way. But as for me, myself, personally, I prefer the shortcut."
Alice, Oh!
Card painters," Da dee dee da da da, Doodle de do, dee do dee do, bum bum bum bum, painting the roses red, we’re painting the roses red, we dare not stop or waste a drop, so let the paint be spread. We’re painting the roses red, we’re painting the roses red! Painting the roses red, and many a tear we shed, because we know they’ll cease to grow, in fact they’ll soon be dead. Noooo! And yet we go ahead, painting the roses red, red, red, red, red, red, red, red. Painting the roses red, we’re painting the roses red…"
Alice," Oh, pardon me, but mister Three, why must you paint them red?"
Card painters," Huh? Oh! Well, the fact is, miss: we planted the white roses by mistake. And, the queen, she likes them red. If she saw what we said, she’d raise a fuss and each of us would quickly lose his head."
Alice, Goodness!
Card painters," Since this is the thought we dread, we’re painting the roses red!"
Alice, Oh dear! Then let me help you! Painting the roses red…
 Card painters," We’re painting the roses red. Don’t tell the queen what you have seen, or say that’s what we said, what, we’re painting the roses red…"
Alice," Yes, painting the roses red…"
Card painters," Not pink, not green…"
Alice, Not aquamarine…
 Card painters, We’re painting the roses red!
Card painters, The Queen! The Queen!
Alice, The Queen!
Card painters, The Queen! …
Queen," Cards, halt! Count off!"
Cards," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, Jack."
Alice, The rabbit!
White Rabbit," He…he… her imperial highness, he… her grace, her excellency, her royal majesty, the Queen of Hearts! And the King…"
Queen," Hum… Who’s been painting my roses red? Who’s been painting my roses red? Who dares to taint, with vulgar paint, the royal flower bed? For painting my roses red, someone will lose his head!"
Three," Oh, no! Your majesty! Please, it’s all his fault!"
Two," Not me, your grace! The Ace, the Ace!"
Queen, You?
Ace," No, Two!"
Queen, The Deuce you say?
Two," Not me, the Three!"
Queen, That’s enough! Off with their heads!
Cards," They’re going to lose their heads, for painting the roses red, it serves them right, they planted white, the roses should be red. Oh, they’re going to lose their head…"
Queen, Silence!
Alice," Oh, please, please! They were only trying to…"
Queen, And who is this?
King," Uh… well, well, well, now, eh… let me see, my dear. It certainly isn’t a heart… do you suppose it’s a club?"
Queen," Why, it’s a little girl."
Alice," Yes, and- and I was hoping…"
Queen," Look up, speak nicely, and don’t twiddle your fingers! Turn out your toes. Curtsey. Open your mouth a little wider, and always say ‘yes, your majesty’!"
Alice," Yes, your majesty!"
Queen," Hmhmhmhm. Now, um, where do you come from, and where are you going?"
Alice," Well, um, I’m trying to find my way home…"
Queen, Your way? All ways here are my ways!
Alice," Well, yes, I know, but I was just thinking…"
Queen," Curtsey while you’re thinking, it saves time."
Alice," Yes, your majesty, but I was only going to ask…"
Queen, I’ll ask the questions! Do you play croquet?
Alice," Why, yes, your majesty."
Queen, Then let the game begin!
King," In your places, in your places, By order of the king! Hurry, hurry, hurry!"
Queen," Shuffle deck! Cards cut! Deal cards! Cards, halt! … Silence! (sighs) … Off with his head!"
King," Off with his head, off with his head! By order of the king. You heard what she said!"
Queen, You’re next!
Alice," Oh, but…"
Queen, Hahaha… my dear.
Alice," Ahhh… Yes, your majesty."
Queen, Hmhmhmhmhm….
Cards, (laughs)
Alice, Oh… (laughs)! Stop!
Queen, (mutters) Of all the impossible...
Alice, Do you want us both to lose our heads?
Flamingo, Uh! Hum!
Alice," Well, I don’t!"
Cards, (laughs) Hurray! … (laughs)
Cheshire Cat," La la la da da dum… la la la hmm… I say, how are you getting on?"
Alice, Not at all.
Cheshire Cat, Beg your pardon?
Alice, I said ‘not at all’!
Queen, Whom are you talking to?
Alice," Oh, uh… a cat, your majesty!"
Queen, Cat? Where?
Alice, There! Oh… Oh there he is again!
Queen," I warn you child, if I lose my temper, you lose your head, understand?"
Cheshire Cat," You know, we could make her really angry. Shall we try?"
Alice, Oh no no!
Cheshire Cat," Oh, but it’s lots of fun!"
Alice," No, no, no! Stop! Oh no!"
White Rabbit, Oh my fur and whiskers!
King, Oh dear! Save the queen!
Queen, Someone’s head will roll for this! Yours! Off with her…
King," But- but consider, my dear. Couldn’t she have a trial… uh… first?"
Queen, Trial?
King," Well, just a… uh… little trial? Hmm?"
Queen, Hmm. Very well then. Let the trial begin!
White Rabbit, Huh… your majesty… members of the jury… loyal subjects…
King, A-hem…
White Rabbit," …and the king. The prisoner at the bar is charged with enticing her majesty, the Queen of Hearts, into a game of croquet, and thereby willfully…"
Alice, But…
White Rabbit," …and with malice aforethought, teasing, tormenting, and otherwise annoying our beloved…"
Queen, Don’t mind all that! Get to the part where I lose my temper.
White Rabbit, Bwbwbwl… thereby causing the queen to lose her temper.
Queen," Now, Ha ha… are you ready for your sentence?"
Alice," Sentence? Ah, but there must be a verdict first!"
Queen, Sentence first! Verdict afterwards.
Alice, But that just isn’t the way!
Queen, All ways are…
Alice," Your ways, your majesty."
Queen," Yes, my child. Off with her…"
King," Consider, my dear. Uh… we called no witnesses… Uh… couldn’t we hear… maybe one or two? Ha? Maybe?"
Queen," Oh, very well. But get on with it!"
King," First witness! First witness! Ah, we’ll call the first witness."
White Rabbit, The March Hare.
King," Oh, oh, what do you know about this uh… unfortunate affair?"
March Hare, Nothing.
Queen, Nothing whatever?
March Hare, Nothing whatever!
Queen," That’s very important! Jury, write that down!"
Alice," Unimportant, uh… your majesty means of course…"
Queen, Silence! Next witness.
White Rabbit, The Dormouse!
Queen, Well…
Cards, Shhh!
Queen, What have you to say about this?
Dormouse," Twinkle, twinkle, little bat. How I wonder…"
Queen, That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heard yet. Write that down!
Jury," Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle…"
Alice," Twinkle, twinkle. What next?"
White Rabbit, The Mad Hatter!
Mad Hatter, Oh… he he he he!
Queen, Off with your hat!
Mad Hatter," Oh, my! He he he!"
King, And eh… where were you when this horrible crime was committed?
Mad Hatter," I was home, drinking tea. Today you know is my unbirthday."
King," Why, my dear! Today is your unbirthday too!"
Queen, It is?
 Mad Hatter, It is?
Cards, It is?
 March Hare and Cards, A very merry unbirthday!
Queen, To me?
Alice, Oh no!
 March Hare and Cards, To you! A very merry unbirthday!
Queen, For me?
 March Hare and Cards, For you!
Mad Hatter," Now blow the candle out, my dear and make your wish come true! He he he."
 March Hare and Cards," A very merry unbirthday, to you!"
Alice, Oh! Your majesty!
Queen," Oh, yes, my dear?"
Alice, Look! There he is now!
Queen, He? Where? Who?
Alice, The Cheshire Cat!
Queen, Cat?
Dormouse, Cat! Cat? Cat cat cat cat!
March Hare," Hang on, hang on!"
Mad Hatter, This is terrible!
Dormouse, Cat cat cat cat!
Mad Hatter, Help! Help!
King, Catch him! Stand in!
March Hare, Catch him! Catch him! Go for it!
Mad Hatter," Help him! Catch him! Give me the jam, the jam!"
King, The jam! The jam! By order of the king!
Mad Hatter, The jam!
Queen, Let me have it! 
Queen of Hearts, Somebody’s head is going to roll for this! A-ha!
Alice, The mushroom!
Queen, Off with her h…! (gulps)
Alice," Oh, pooh. I’m not afraid of you! Why, you’re nothing but a pack of cards!"
Cards, Huh?
King, Rule forty-two: all persons more than a mile high must leave the court immediately.
Alice, I’m not a mile high. And I’m not leaving.
Queen," Hehehe… sorry! Rule forty-two, you know."
Alice," And as for you, your majesty! Your majesty indeed! Why, you’re not a queen, but just a fat, pompous, bad tempered old ty- tyrant…"
Queen," Hmhmhmhm… and uh… what were you saying, my dear?"
Cheshire Cat," Well, she simply said that you’re a fat, pompous, bad tempered old tyrant! (laughs)"
Queen, Off with her head!
King, You heard what her majesty said! Off with her head! …
All," Forward, backward, inward, outward, here we go again! No one ever loses and no one can ever win. Backward, forward, outward, inward, bottom to the top, there’s…"
Queen, Off with her head! Off with her head!
March Hare," Just a moment! You can’t leave a tea party without having a cup of tea, you know!"
Alice, But- but I can’t stop now!
March Hare," Ah, but we insist! You must join us in a cup of tea!"
Queen, Off with her head!
Alice, Mister Caterpillar! What will I do?
Caterpillar, Who are you?
Alice, Cough-cough! Cough-cough!
Queen, There she goes! Don’t let her get away! Off with her head!
Doorknob," Awww! Still locked, you know."
Alice, But the Queen! I simply must get out!
Doorknob," Oh, but you are outside."
Alice, What?
Doorknob, See for yourself!
Alice," Why, why that’s me! I’m asleep!"
Queen, Don’t let her get away! Off with her head!
Alice," Alice, wake up! Please wake up, Alice! Alice! Please wake up, Alice! Alice! Alice! Alice!"
Sister, Alice! Alice! Will you kindly pay attention and recite your lesson?
Alice," Huh? Oh. Oh! Uh… how doth the little crocodile, improve his shining tail. And pour the waters of the…"
Sister," Alice, what are you talking about?"
Alice," Oh, I’m sorry, but you see, the Caterpillar said…"
Sister," Caterpillar? Oh, for goodness sake. Alice, I… Oh, well. Come along, it’s time for tea."

I've got a new assignment. I'm covering your rise to fame. -Oh, this is Alvin, Simon and Theodore. -Hi. -Hello. -Hi, Claire. You're hot. Forgot you guys haven't officially met. So, Dave... ...I'm sorry about that night. I really thought that you-- That I was insane? I totally understand it. Talking chipmunks. It's a lot to take in over dinner. But look at you now. You've got the career, promising future, kids. You're like a family. Don't say <i>family</i> in front of Dave. It gives him gas. -Like, clear-the-room gas. -Does not. He doesn't want a family. Why don't you guys go and play or raid the dessert table? Don't take it personally, you guys. Some people don't know a good thing when they've got it. Right, Dave? Claire. No offense, big guy, but you are not good at this. Hey, what do you think of this? -What is it? -It's Alvin. That looks nothing like Alvin. Well, yeah. It's a prototype. We'll sell a million of these things. It's voice-activated. Here, say something to it. Hello, ugly little Alvin doll that looks nothing like Alvin. -See? You love it. It's Spanish. -You know what? That's just weird. Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave. We've got to expand the Munks' fan base. I mean, forget about the music. The music is but a means to the big money, okay? I'm talking about our own fur clothing line, cologne. -I mean-- -They're just kids. No, they're rats. And they could make us both so much money... -...if you just let me work with them. -I can't hear you, the music's too loud. Don't go against me on this, Dave. I never lose. Has anyone tried the chocolate meatballs? I'll probably go into insulin shock. But it's worth it. Oh, a sweet, sweet, sweet molasses meat. Hey, alvster. Love the song, bro. -Up top. -What's up, player? So I see you're enjoying my little spread that I've put out for you guys. What am I talking about? You probably eat like this all the time. Well, Dave says he doesn't wanna spoil us. Dude, you're a rock star. You're supposed to be spoiled. I mean, you should be riding in limousines and private planes. And you should be going to parties like this every night. really? Because Dave says we need our sleep. Look, Alvin, this is hard to say but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it. Dave's holding you back, you know. I could be making you 20 large a day. -Is that a lot? -Yes. Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you. I will tell you. Look, behind your back, Dave Calls you... ...<i>the rats.</i> -Rats? -Yeah. Whatever, right? I know. Well, don't let it bother you. I mean, me? I consider you boys family. And if there's anything you need, anything at all... ...give your uncle Ian a call, all right? -Oh, right. -Ciao."

Theodore, Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!
Eleanor, Aaaah!
Simon, [sighs[ Why do I always have to be right?
Aleanor, I think I sprained my ankle!
Simon," Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?"
Zoe," Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably twice a day by these little fellows and I am still completely normal."
Alvin," Yes, normal."
Simon," Oh, no."
Dave, It's not ugly. It goes with everything and it's soft enough to sleep in.
Ian, All right. I'm gonna crash.
Eleanor, That looks like fun.
Brittney," I can't believe Jeanette's getting all the attention. I'm the pretty one. Jeanette's the smart one. You don't see me running around trying to be all smart, do you?"
Alvin," I know! I'm the fun one, you're the pretty one. "
Brittney, Yeah!
Alvin, Do you know how slippery that dirt is? This is ridiculous. Are you even listening to me? Simon!
Brittney, Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.
Ian," Dave, I barely cared about what you had to say about the first two. I can't imagine the big-boned one is gonna be any more interesting."
Dave," Forget it, let's just keep going."
Jeanette," Simone! Where are you? Zoe, you've gotta do something."
Simone," I'm sorry if I caused you any worry, mademoiselle. But I have something for you. Maybe this will be a way to make it up."
Zoe," Yeah, it is beautiful. Where did you find it?"
Simone, In a cave behind the waterfall. I thought it would look nice on you. But now I realize even the most precious gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Zoe, Yeah. Were there any other jewels or gems or diamonds or anything else in there?
Simone," By the time I found the gold, I had already been gone from my Jeanette far too long."
Theodore, What?
Alvin," Okay, Brit, I'm all done. If you want, I can help you get started... This tree house is awesome. Maybe you are kind of the smart one."
Theodore," Simon? Is Dave ever gonna find us? Simon? I mean, Simone?"
Simone," I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?"
Theodore, Yes! About Dave! Are we ever going to find him?
Simone," I see you are sad, mon ami. And I hate to see you sad. I will help you find your friend Dave."
Theodore, You really think you can find him?
Simone, I know I can! And then I will find this Simon you keep speaking of!
Simone," As Dave and I have never met, I will need you to describe him for me."
Theocore," Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller."
Simone, Very helpful.
Theodore, And he's about this tall.
Simone," Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?"
Theodore, I don't think so.
Simone, Then these footprints must not be his.
Theodore, [gasps] Jungle Monster!
Theodore, The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!
Simone, Or hungry. Allons-y! That means let's go.
Alvin," Great, a volcano."
Brittney, Of course! That's why the water was so hot! It's being heated by the underground magma chamber!
Jeanette, How do you know that? 
Brittney, I have no idea! The place where I get my nails done always has the Science Channel on. Maybe I accidentally paid attention.
Zoe," Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike? Like, I don't know, maybe to the waterfall or whatever?"
Alvin," Not now, Zoe! The whole island is going to explode!"
Zoe, What?
Alvin," Guys, we've got to get off this island. We have to build a raft, now."
Simone, I've been hit!
Theodore, By Dave's necklace?
Simone, Tell Jeanette I will watch over her with angel wings.
Theodore, Dave?
Dave, Theodore!
Simone, Dave? Told you we'd find him!
Dave, Simon!
Simone," It is Simone, but I am often confused for this Simon fellow. Perhaps we look alike?"
Dave, Simone?
Theodore, Ian!
Ian," Hey, you found the chubby one."
Dave," Don't worry, Theodore. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?"
Theodore, What was that?
Ian, That's an active volcano.
Alvin," Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck. Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes. Jeanette, find as many coconuts and mangoes as you can. Who knows how long we'II be out there."
Dave, What can I do to help?
Dave, Eleanor! What happened?
Eleanor," You know, just a zip-line accident."
Dave, A what?
Elaenor, I'm fine. It only hurts when I try to explain it.
Alvin, I thought you'd never find us. That you weren't even looking.
Alvin, Because I'm such a pain in the...
Dave, Alvin.
Alvin," I know, you don't think I'm a pain."
Dave," No, you're a pain. But I'd come, no matter what."
Simone," Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon."
Ian," I get it, Frenchie, you come from a rich history. Well, guess what, we're all gonna be history if we don't get out of here."
Chipettes, Uncle Ian!
Alvin, What's he doing here?
Dave, It's kind of a long story.
Dave," I don't know, Alvin, I think you've got this under control."
Alvin," Theodore, you and Eleanor are on rope duty. Dave and Ian, we need oars. Simone, you and Jeanette are in charge of food. And, Zoe..."
Zoe," No, I know, I know. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pack up my balls!"
Dave, Who's that?
Alvin, Another long story.
Ian, Very impressive.
Dave," Just seeing everyone come together to build it, I just want to say... It can wait."
Dave, Jeanette?
Alvin," Guys! Guys! Over here! Come quick, hurry!"
Simon, Why are you calling me Simone?
Alvin, Simon? 
Alvin, Ha ha! You're back! It finally wore off!
Simon, What wore off?
Alvin," You were bitten by a spider. It, like, messed up your brain."
Simon," Is that why I think I see Dave and a half-Ian, half-bird?"
Dave," No, it's really me. And really Ian."
Ian, 'Sup?
Allvin," Simon, where's Jeanette? She was out here with you."
Simon, Jeanette? I don't know...
Brittney," I do. It's Zoe. She took her. Simon, I need to know where you found that gold bracelet."
Simon, What gold bracelet?
Brittney, The one you gave to Jeanette.
Simon, What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?
Brittney, On your date.
Simon, Jeanette and I are dating?
Brittney," Okay, he's useless. Theodore, Eleanor, you're gonna have to lead the way."
Theodore, I don't remember exactly how to get there.
Eleanor, I do!
Dave," Which way, Eleanor?"
Simon," Are you kidding me? Guys, I can't do that."
Simon," No, I didn't. That was Simone, that was not me."
Brittney," But Simone is you. He's in there somewhere. You just have to find him, tout de suite. Because Jeanette needs you, Simon."
Simon," No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it."
Dave," All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft. If the volcano blows before I make it out of here, you have to promise me you'II..."
Ian, Leave without you. Got it.
Alvin, Dave. I'm coming with you.
Alvin," Remember I said someday I may need to disobey you? Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you."
Dave, Let's go.
Dave, Jeanette!
Alvin, Dave! They're supposed to be behind that waterfall!
Alvin, Zoe! 
Zoe," No, no. Not another step. Don't come any closer."
Dave," Are you all right, Jeanette?"
Jeanette," I'm pretty freaked out, and those earrings tasted awful."
Alvin," Zoe, you don't have to do this."
Zoe, I don't? I spent ten years looking for this treasure. It's the whole reason why I came to this stinking island!
Alvin, You mean you didn't crash-land?
Zoe, They said that I was crazy and they said that this map was a fake. And now the treasure is mine!
Alvin, Run!
Dave," Jeanette, come on, come on. Run!"
Jeanette," Oh, no, help!"
Simon, Jeanette!
Jeanette, Simone! 
Simon, It's Simon!
Alvin," What are you guys doing? Help me. Please. Help me save my dad! Hurry! I got you, Dave. Come on! Help me, guys."

I get it. So, I have to ask. The boys? Are they, like, your adopted kids, or... How does that work? I don't know, I never really thought about it. What? They're lucky to have you. Crazy idea. Have you ever been to Miami? (AMERICAN IDOL THEME PLAYING) MAN: This is American Idol! I'm sorry to have to do this... but you're going to Hollywood! Ah. I've always wanted to say that! Why did they get to move out and do all this cool stuff? Uh, well, Alvin... girls are scientifically proven to mature faster than boys. ALVIN: Ah, whatever. Hey, guys. SIMON: Dave! THEODORE: Hi. Sorry I'm late. I had to pick up a few things on the way home. ALVIN: No worries, we've just been ruminating on why we still live at home. So, what'd you guys think of Samantha? Oh, she's awesome. We loved her. Ooh, leftovers. (GRUNTING) Ooh, I can't wait. Oh, I can taste it. Yes! Yummy. Oh. I can't eat this. Whoa! That is a serious engagement ring. Wait a second. That means Dave is going to ask Samantha to marry him. Hold on, we don't know that. They've only been together a few months, so you're probably overreacting. But what if it's true? Uh-oh. Here he comes. Act casual. (CHANTING) DAVID: Huh. What are you guys doing? Uh, yoga. Downward munk? Well, that's great to hear that you guys like Samantha, because“. She's gonna become a big part of my life. Oh, and good news. My plus one isn't going to waste. She is coming to Miami with me. (CLUCKS) I'm standing right here. I can hear what he's saying. I've always wanted a mom. ALVIN: Guys... ...if Samantha is our mom, that makes Miles... Our brother. THEODORE: No! Deep breaths, Theodore. In and out. It's going to be okay. What are we gonna do? ALVIN: Guys, it's time. Operation ring retrieval is a go. No ring, no proposal. No proposal, no Miles. Theo, fall in line, soldier. Oh, brother. (CAWING) Alvin, what... Are we doing a charade? Oh, cool. Two words. No. First down? What are you... Two syllables. Sounds like. Is it a movie? First word. A song? Angry. (GROWLS) Get over here. Okay- Still no idea what you're saying. Theodore, you keep an eye on Dave. Simon and I will get the ring. (MOANS) (GRUNTS) Uh-oh. (GRUNTS) There you are. Alvin, grab this. (GRUNTING) (SNEEZES) Let's do this. Yes! The bag's gone. No. You mean that bag over there? ALVIN: And I'm back to ""Yes."" (ALARM RINGS) Uh-oh. And right back to ""No."" Abort. Abort. Let's go. Guys... what are you doing in here? Uh... Well... We... just wanted to spend as much time as possible with you before you left for Miami. Yeah. All right. I'll make breakfast. Whoo-hoo! I love breakfast. Alvin, grab it. Ooh, ooh, Belgian waffles, pancakes. So excited. Okay, guys... Miss Price from next door, she's gonna peek in on you... make sure you're all right. What? She's nuts. We should be the ones checking in on her. Well, after that big party you guys threw... I don't feel very comfortable with you guys staying here unsupervised. You got it? (BELL RINGS) Oh, that must be Samantha and Miles. (COUGHING) Miles? Yeah, he's going to stay with you guys for a few days. So, you don't feel comfortable leaving us alone, but you're okay leaving us with that psychopath? No, he's a great kid. It'll be fun. You know, it'll be, uh, a good bonding experience for you guys. Uh, I'm pretty sure Miles would interpret ""bonding experience"" as super-gluing us together. Hi. Wow. Great place. Oh, thanks. Make yourself at home. Mi casa, su casa. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Thank you, David, that's very generous of you to open your home. Wow. That's really impressive. I actually don't speak Spanish. SIMON: He said that it's very generous of you to open your home. (CONTINUES IN SPANISH) I also speak Spanish. And you're not fooling anyone with your good boy routine. I'm fooling everyone. They have no idea that I'm going to make you my personal servant. (MILES LAUGHS) All right. I guess this is it. Have a great weekend, guys. And boys... try to show me you can handle some independence, okay? All right, bye, sweetie. Be good. Okay. All right. Here we go. I can feel the bonding happening already. (LAUGHS) We're gonna be doing tons of bonding. Where's the Super Glue? (MUSIC PLAYING) ALVIN: Miles, if we're going to make this work, we need to talk. Feels like it's working. But, good talk. You can't shut us out forever. He means emotionally, but... I want to focus on the physically shutting us out of our own home part. I have to pee. You guys are so naive. Trust me, this thing with Dave and my mom is temporary. If by temporary you mean, ""till death do they part""... then yeah. Totally temporary. What are you talking about? He's talking about marriage, Miles. Wedding bells. Dave liked it and he's gonna put a ring on it. A bag of tissue. What? Scandalous. It's gone. Uh. He must have packed the ring last night before bed. (GASPS) He's going to propose to Samantha in Miami. So you think we're all gonna become, like, one big happy family? No one said happy. No offense to your mom. She actually seems quite wonderful. Yeah. It's you we're not thrilled about. Well, the feeling is mutual. And you guys can keep Dave too. My dad died when I was little and I've done just fine without one. Oh. I'm sorry, Miles. Don't be. I didn't know him. If Dave and my mom do get married... they'll wanna have their own kids. And you're not even Dave's real sons... you're just a bunch of chipmunks that he calls his kids. Before you guys know it, you'll be back out in the forest. Holding your nuts all winter. Hey. First of all, that's what squirrels do. We are chipmunks. Um, Alvin, chipmunks do that too. And the fact that I didn't know that... is exactly why we cannot end up back in the forest. But... Dave wouldn't do that to us. MILES: He already has. Why do you think you guys are here and my mom's in Miami? Meeting of the Munks. I don't want Miles to be right any more than you do, but it all kind of lines up. New job, new house, new girlfriend, new family. I don't want to go back to the forest. And I am definitely not going to end up related to that guy. (BELCHING) Hmm. Nice form. Here's the deal, Miles. We all go to Miami to stop this proposal... and then we never have to see each other again. I'm in. Can't get you chipmunks out of my life fast enough. That's the smartest thing you've said since we met you. THEODORE: Are you sure there's enough money in your piggy bank? Guys, it's a credit card. We'll get 4 tickets. Stop worrying. Hello, boys. ALL: Hey, Miss Price. I'm supposed to be keeping an eye on you... So I think I'll use... this one. (LAUGHING) How are we gonna get to Miami if she's gonna be watching us? Guys, I have a plan. (GROANS) The 4 words society fears most. I can't believe that worked. It wasn't so much me as it was the peanuts dipped in cough syrup. (SNORING GENTLY) That's really messed up. Respect. Thank you! Alvin, these aren't even chipmunks. They're squirrels. ALVIN: Beggars can't be choosers. Besides, once we put them in the shirts from the Alvin, Simon and Theodore dolls... Miss Price won't be able to tell the difference. Yeah, let's do it. Ooh, oh... I get to change me! I can't believe I maxed out my mom's entire card in this one ticket. We're fine. Just stick to the plan. I'm starting to think I should go through cargo with Theo. Shh. Be silent. Be still. And you. Get in there. Ow! Easy! Both of you guys. ALVIN: Watch the zipper. Next! Who knows what you're carrying in this thing. (MEOWS) (DOGS BARKING) Go on through. Whoa! What's that? That is a... stuffed Alvin doll. You know, from that lame singing chipmunks group. Um, yeah. I'm gonna need to see what's in that backpack, please. Oh, no. Yeah. (GRUNTS) Um, it's just a doll. Chucky was just a doll. (CLEARS THROAT) This is Alvin. It's what the ""A"" is for. He does a lot of bending and back up. He does splits. (ALVIN SQUEALS) He can twist. Like Linda Blair almost. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) You can use it as a weight-loss device. (GURGLING) I can feel the sweat. It even talks. It says, ""I'm a dumb stupid-head."" Sorry, the batteries might be a bit low. Ow! I'm a dumb stupid-head! (LAUGHS) So, he's... Ow! And it bites. I think that was just a design flaw. There's probably a recall. You can put the doll back in the bag. Not the dark place! What I am gonna need... is for you to take a step right over there... because we're gonna need to do a quick body search. Body search? Body search! ALVIN: Good luck, Simon! Yeah. Okay- (GASPS) Oh, no. Where to hide, where to hide? Relax. Put your arms out. They're out. (MOANS SOFTLY) One last spot to get. SIMON: I don't wanna go to jail. I don't wanna go to jail! (GASPS) That's not mine. You just holding it for a friend? SIMON: No, no, not that, not that. (GRUNTS) I don't get paid enough. Get out of here. ALVIN: Real smooth, Simon. I'm sorry! I just, I got so nervous. You are lucky I don't flush the both of you down the toilet! SIMON: Well, I'm glad we sent Theodore to Baggage. He never would have made it through Security. Wow! Hi, everyone! Cold in here, isn't it? THEODORE: Whoa! (EXCLAIMING) (SCREAMS) Miles, will you ask a flight attendant for some peanuts? We're hungry. Yeah. I too would love a water. But no ice. It's supposed to be filthy. Ooh, which reminds me. (SINGSONG) Germs, germs, go away, don't come back any other day, okay. Shut up and stay out of sight. SIMON: Hey! Easy! It smells in here. If you're not gonna feed us, I'm going to forage. Not a great idea, Alvin. We're not legitimate passengers! (SNIFFS) Ugh! Oops! Sorry! (GASPS) I didn't mean to startle you. (CHUCKLES) I'm not startled. It's just you're... You're you. (CHUCKLES) I am me. And, you know, if you have a pen... I'm always happy to sign an autograph for a fan. (LAUGHS MOCKINGLY) I'm not a fan. Okay- Well, um, I'll be seeing you. Excuse me! Pardon me! Coming through. Now where in this tin can can I get some snacks? On, baby! (GRUNTING) Hi! I'm Theodore. Shh. (MONKEY CHATTERS) Inside voice. Please stop. You're gonna make the other animals nervous! Uh, okay, I'll let you out. But you have to promise to go back in before we land. (CHATTERS) (GRUNTS) Got it. There you go! Oh! Thank you, friend. (SCREECHING) Hey! Please, everyone relax! Um, Mister Monkey? Wha... Wait! Don't do that. No. Bad monkey! (MOCKING) I asked you to stop! Hey! Please! I'm begging you, Monkey Man! (CHOMPING) (SLURPING) What? You've never seen a chipmunk in first class before? Uh, actually, I recently flew next to The Chipettes and they were ladies. Hey. Don't judge me. I saw Pink Flamingos. Excuse me. May I see your boarding pass? Yeah, well, funny thing about that. Ha! Gotta run! Come here. Get back here! (WOMAN SCREAMS) Simon! Run! Where? We're on a plane. I don't know! Come on. Freeze! Air marshal. Don't move. SIMON: Can we move now? This is a very hard pose to hold. (MONKEY CHATTERING) What's that? ALVIN: Uh-Oh. This can't be good. What the... What? What? All right! Everybody calm down! It's just a monkey. All right? Birds! Birds! (WINGS FLAPPING) Help! Someone save me! (BARKING) Nice doggy... Theo! Over here! Jump! Birds and dogs! Oh, my God! Okay, now there's a goat. (BLEATING) And an otter. And an otter! God! MAN: Uh, ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. Listen! We're going to be making an... emergency landing in Austin, Texas due to a herd of chinchillas in the cockpit. All right, you heard him! The plane's going down. (ALL SCREAMING) Not down like down-down. Safely-safely. We're not crashing! You people are idiots! We're all gonna die! What an idiot! Oh, great speech, Churchill. You better watch it! Do you know who you're talking to? I am the police of the sky! (MACAW SQUAWKS) Really? AGENT SUGGS: Okay. Let's make sure we have everything. You released animals from cargo, and then you forced an emergency landing. We also snuck onto the plane. Uh-huh. That's right. Theodore! That is three major infractions on one flight. Here's a fun fact. That's three more infractions than I've ever had in all my years as an air marshal. Congratulations on such a distinguished career, sir. Did you hear that? Because of that ""distinguished career""... I've got a meeting with Homeland Security next week about a promotion. Another congratulations, sir. Shut up! What do you think they're gonna bring up when they interview me, huh? My decade of perfect service... or that one time that three chipmunks turned my flight into Noah's Ark? Probably the time with the chipmunks. Yeah. Um, I meant the other one. Look, sir, what could we possibly have done to make you hate us so much? (BANGS TABLE) I'll tell you what you did. Whoa! Holy Christmas. (CHIPMUNKS SONG PLAYING) I got a little early gift for you. (LAUGHS) Oh, James. You shouldn't have. No. Wait a second. I want to lnstagram a video of your reaction. Merry Christmas! I'm breaking up with you! What? Thanks. And The Chipmunks? Grow up, James. (MUMBLING) Wait. (CHIPMUNKS LAUGHING) (SCREAMS) Awkward . You provided the soundtrack to my heartbreak. But now it's payback time. I am putting you three on the No-Fly List. What? No! But we have to get to Miami! You can't do that! You see, I'm an air marshal. I'm all-powerful... I'm all-seeing... and I'm all-knowing. Then you obviously know you just made that entire speech... with your tie in a cup of coffee. Okay. (GRUNTS) I'll be back in two minutes. You also still have a little parrot poop on your shirt. 10 minutes. And one more thing. Don't even think about leaving. I have a very particular set of skills. Skills that I have acquired over a very long... You just put your hand on an ink pad. 15 minutes. (GASPS) (SIGHS) Whoa. That guy is the mayor of Crazy Town. We gotta get you out of here, now. Let's go. (CHUCKLES) Oh, this is gonna be the best... Come on! AGENT SUGGS: Really? Nobody runs on Agent James Suggs. Come on. Come on. Go. MILES: Here you go. Thanks so much. Well, that's as far as my money takes us. Which puts us 2 hours and 30 minutes from Miami. Hey! ALVIN: Yes! THEODORE: All right! By plane. Oh. Come on! Guys, the party is in three days. We need to get to Miami. Fast. And, as if we're not in enough trouble already, it's Dave. Oh, man. Well, we cannot possibly pick up. We have to pick up, or Dave will know something is wrong. Dave's gonna know something's wrong when he sees us standing around a bunch of trash cans, in a parking lot in the middle of nowhere! Hmm. Good point. Ready to go eat? Uh... Yeah. Everything okay? Let me check on something. Hello? Hi, it's Dave. Are you busy? Oh, hi, Dave. No, I'm not busy at all. No, I'm just dining with a friend. What do you need? All right, I'm gonna take a look. I'm right at the window. Oh, no! They've eaten everything! And I mean everything! Yeah, that sounds about right. Just like a guinea pig Armageddon! Well, thanks for checking on them, Miss Price. (SCREAMS) False alarm. Sounds like they're having a blast. Oh, good. You ready? Yeah. Um, Alvin, I think maybe we should go somewhere else. Whoa, hey. Sorry, fellas. 21 and over. But it's dark outside, and we don't have anywhere else to go. Well, I wish I could help you out, but I got a bar packed with people... waiting to hear a band whose singer is stuck 50 miles from here with a flat tire. So, unless you guys know anyone who can carry a tune... I'm gonna have to bid you good night. How would you feel about some singing chipmunks? Whoa! You guys really know The Chipettes? Uh... Really? Please welcome, all the way from Los Angeles, California... The Chipmunks. Ooh! Warm crowd. So, can you really play? Can you really sing? (GUITAR PLAYING) Whoo! Put your hands together for me. Um!

I have a reason to believe there's a fugitive chipmunk in your beard. You don't think I'd know if there was an animal living in my beard? I don't. Beard peanuts? Gotcha! Uh-oh. Ow!

I'm waiting on a guy that owes me 76 bucks. Ah! MILES: You mean that guy? You know what, we'll double it. All right. But Alvin's not here yet! Forget about him, let's go! Wait, wait! There he is, there he is! You... Come on, let's go, come on! Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry! (ALVIN PANTING) Miles, give me your belt. You little hood rats! Alvin, run! I will hunt you down! THEODORE: Slow down! Move your furry little feet! SIMON: Alvin, let's go! Hurry, Alvin! I will pounce on you! Alvin, jump! Hurry up, Alvin, come on! I will... (GROANS) Whoopsie. ...take a little nap. MILES: So, how much is this gonna cost? CAB DRIVER: To the nearest bus station, $32. MILES: Oh, we're a little short. How short? About 32 bucks. (BRAKES SCREECHING) Have a nice night. Easy for you to say. You're not the one who has to sleep outside! Thanks for nothing! Drive safely! What? I hope he gets home safe. THEODORE: Ouch! ALVIN: (GROANS) I got a splinter in my tail. Ow! Ow! I can't sleep without my pillow. Ow! I don't suppose they make Tempur-Pedic tree branches, do they? (SIGHS) Seriously, guys? You're the ones who are supposed to be comfortable sleeping in trees, not me. We're not talking to you, okay? Not after you tried to leave me behind! First, awesome, because I don't wanna talk to you either. And second, you guys would've done the same thing to me. ALVIN: No, Miles, we actually would have waited for you. Yeah, we're in this together. You mess with one of us, you mess with all of us. I've heard your lame family motto, man. It's a bunch of crap. People look out for themselves. It's biology, it's what animals do. Well, on behalf of animals everywhere... I find your attitude insulting. Call it whatever you want, man. It's true. What, you think my dad was thinking about anyone other than himself... when he left me and my mom? SIMON: But, I... I thought you said your dad was... (SIGHS) Right, um... He might as well have. He left when I was only five. Sorry, Miles. Whatever. I don't care, you know? I've done just fine without him. ALVIN: Miles, listen. If Dave and your mom end up together... he's a good person. He would never bail on you. Then why are you making this trip? Right. Because you think he's gonna ditch you, too. Look, dads are overrated. Eventually, you will get over him leaving. Really? Yeah. ♪ And meet me there ♪ Bundles of flowers ♪ We wait through The hours of cold ♪ Shelter as we go X (THEODORE PANTING) Oh. I can't... I'm too tired. MILES: Dude! Are you joking?

Hear what? Huh. Never mind. Guys, last night was one of the best nights of my life. It was pretty crazy. Even that Suggs guy hung out with us. Yeah, he's not that bad after all. Hey, we missed a call from Dave. And a text. 27 of them. Uh-oh. Oh, no. (SNORING) Where am I? What is this? (SCREAMS) Suggs! Who are you? It's Vitto, the band's manager, remember? The only thing I remember is being attacked by a trombone. Oh, right, yeah. You got that crazy bump on your head. You didn't care, though. You just wanted to party! We hit every jazz club in the Quarter. What do you mean, ""We""? You, me, and those dope chipmunk dudes! I partied with those tree-skunks? They're the ones who dared you to get that sassy tattoo! What? What? (GASPS) How could I have let them talk me into this? Oh, no. You asked for that one. The other one was their idea. What ""other one""? What? (SHRIEKS SOFTLY) This is where they told us to meet them, right? Well, yelled at us to meet them. Hopefully they had time to cool off on the plane. There you are. Dave! Dave! Mom!

Dave, I swear, it wasn't as crazy as it looked on TV. Oh, really? Well, let me just pull up some of Theodore's tweets from last night. ""Only one word to describe this night, ""Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy."" Or, ""if you wanna get crazy, ""go to New Orleans. It's the craziest."" Or, ""In a New Orleans Jazz Parade, ""so crazy."" We're really sorry, Dave. Sorry's not gonna cut it this time, guys. If it were up to me, we'd be going home, but I gotta get back to Miami. Do not smile. You guys are grounded in Miami and also when we get back to LA. (SCOFFS) When are we not grounded? You'll be so old, your fur will be gray. Yeah, that goes for your fur too, Miles. I don't have fur. Well, whatever you have is grounded... for a long time. Let's go. Huh. They didn't kill us after all. Feels like a win. Hey, guys, Operation ""No Proposal"" is still on. Yeah! All right! High... Oh, fist. Give me some. Ow! Oh, sorry. Take it easy! Guys, come on. ALVIN: Jeez. Yeah. Here you go. Thank you. You're welcome. And may I see your ID, please? Yes. Thank you. Hey, um... Are you sure about this? Because if this three-ring circus is too scary for you, I totally get it... and we could just go back to LA. I mean, you wouldn't be the first guy to head for the hills once we showed our crazy cards. Please, your circus only has one ring. (MOCKING) Stop looking at me. DAVID: Mine's the three-ringer. You're the one who should think about heading for the hills. I'm not going anywhere. Except to get us a coffee. (CHUCKLES) I'll meet you at the gate. Sir? Is there a problem? Problem? What problem? There sure is. Oh, man. Oh, right. Whoopsies. That. Guys. Oh, nuts. Seriously, guys, the No-Fly List? Come on! At least we're not on the No-Drive List. There's no such thing as a No-Drive List, Theodore. I'm sure you guys will find a way to start one. Let's not overreact, Dave. The only reason we left home in the first place... Guys, not now, okay? I worked my butt off on Ashley's album, and because of you three... I might not even get to the record release! Not to mention, you've ruined this trip for me and Samantha. It's just, when you took Samantha to Miami... Theodore, I'm not in the mood to hear it. But Dave, we don't... Alvin, don't. You'll just make it worse. Thank you for nothing. Agent Suggs, Air Marshal. I'll be with you in a moment, sir. Okay, you're gonna regret that. Did you help three chipmunks get their rental car today? Yeah, they came in. With some guy, probably their dad. Probably not their dad, because he's a human... and they're chipmunks! Hey! Families come in all shapes and sizes, sir. It's not for me to judge. We don't do that here, at Miss Bee's. Okay, this is how it's gonna go down... I need you to go back there, and get me the GPS information for that rental car. We don't track our rental cars, sir. Oh! Is that so? I work for the United States government... and we pretty much track everything. I know what you had for lunch today. Falafel! Now scurry back there, and get me the frequency and uplink code from that rental car. Hey! And I need the fastest set of wheels you've got! (HONKS) Are you kidding me right now? Do you know what this is? This is a roller skate with wheels. Pretty sure roller skates come with wheels. Ah! (YELLS) It's like Tweety Bird! Buckle up! AGENT SUGGS: Shut up! This is like driving a parakeet! Those rodents got a 200-mile head start. Time to roll up some road, Suggs. (EVIL LAUGHTER) ♪ So say Geronimo! ♪ Say Geronimo! ♪ Say Geronimo! ♪ Say Geronimo! ♪ Say Geronimo! I (SUGGS LAUGHING) Come on! Fly, Bee! Fly! ALVIN: Are we there yet? DAVID: No. Are we there yet? No. ALVIN: All right! THEODORE: Awesome! Remember, guys, we're here to make a quick pit stop... then we're getting back on the road. SIMON: Don't worry, Dave, it'll be really quick. THEODORE: Yeah, super quick. Umm-hmm. (SLURPING) Thanks, Dave. I just needed a little snack to get me from lunch to dinner. Oh, that's unusual. SIMON: Don't be mad, Dave. It would have been rude to not order something. Hey, guys! Look what I won! Isn't he cute? (DAVE LAUGHS) Look at that face! That's actually funny, Alvin. I Say Geronimo! I Say Geronimo! I Whoa! All right! ALVIN: Now we're talking. THEODORE: WOW. Holy guacamole! I could live here. Hey, no smiling. You're still grounded, remember? Thanks. Thank you. This is what I'm talking about. THEODORE: Hi. Wow! Hola! on, baby. If this is grounded... ground me for life. Don't tempt me. ALVIN: Hey, Dave! We'd like to do the mature thing... and accept partial responsibility for all the trouble we've caused. Partial? Yeah. 60-40, on us. 70-30? As much as I hate the idea of letting you three out of my sight for even a second... Samantha and I have dinner plans that I can't get out of. So if anything happens, we'll be at the villa. Ooh, romantic. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) What? Hi. Hi. All right, you are not to leave this room. Do you understand, young man? Yeah. ALVIN: You guys don't have to worry about us. We'll be on our best behavior tonight. I promise. Whoa. I know you will, because I hired a babysitter to keep an eye on you. What? Come on. Oh, man. We'll be home after the party. (CHIPMUNKS GROANING) Almost forgot this. (GASPS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Dave is going to propose tonight. What gave that away? The romantic dinner or the engagement ring? Alvin, what are we going to do? Absolutely nothing. What? Alvin's right. This hasn't been so bad. Maybe we just... do nothing. ""Nothing""? Guys, ""nothing"" isn't a plan! We can't do ""nothing."" Sure we can. Good luck proposing without this. (GASPS) Alvin! When did you grab it? I found it in his bag, five minutes ago. Does that mean we did it? We did it. Huzzah! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ Turn down for what? SIMON: Whoo-hoo! We did it! We did it! Whoo-hoo! ♪ Turn down for what? r Come on, Miles, join the party? Miles? SIMON: Miles, wait up! Come on, man. Let's celebrate! We did it! Yeah. You guys ruined Dave's proposal and now we don't have to hang out. Miles, hold on. That doesn't mean we can't be friends. SIMON: Yeah, man. I thought we had a great time in New Orleans. So did I. And then I saw you celebrating like you won the Super Bowl... the second you found out we weren't gonna be family. So... see you. Miles, wait! I can explain! Guys, come on. Miles... We've been through a lot together. Don't walk away now. Yeah. Come on, Miles. (TIRES SCREECHING) Uh, Miles? Miles? Miles! Watch out! Alvin, he can't hear us! I'll knock him out of the way! Slingshot on three! Let's do this. One... two... three! (SCREAMING) Whoa! (GASPS) (GROANS) Theo. Theodore! Theo. Theodore. Is he okay? I don't know. Theo! Come on! Get up! Please! (WHEEZING) (GASPS) No! Theodore! Come on! Say something, say something! (GASPS) I smell... empanadas? Theo! Oh! Theo, you're alive! Is this Heaven? No, it's South Beach. (GIGGLES) Theodore, you saved my life. Like we always say, you mess with one of us... Don't make me say it, man, it's so lame. Miles, he got hit by a car for you. You mess with all of us. All right! Whoo-hoo! Oh, ouch! Miles, we are so sorry. We haven't been fair to you from day one. And the truth is... you'd make a great brother. SIMON AND THEODORE: Yeah! I feel the same about you guys. So, I guess we're going to be family after all. Except for one tiny detail... By stealing the ring, we've effectively ruined the proposal. ALVIN: You're right. We need to get that ring, and get to that restaurant! Let's do it. Come on. (AGENT SUGGS LAUGHS) Looks like Air Marshal Suggs is gonna be checking into the Shelborne Hotel. Yes! Time for a chip hunt! BABYSITTER: I really wanna go with you... but I'm stuck babysitting. Aw, man. The babysitter. I hope when they get here, they're not annoying. Let's go. Like, this last time... I had a kid, and he was, like... ""Oh, my gosh, can I have yogurt?"" And I was like... ""Oh, my gosh, can you go to sleep?"" I don't think she knows we're here. I was like, ""Ridiculous."" I don't think she knows she's here. This really sucks, when you're so responsible, and, like, everyone around you is so not. You know what I mean? It's like, it's hard. Oh, there you are. Well, okay, I'm totally texting you right now. Hold on, let me send you this picture. He's, like, super cute. I really like him. Come on! Let's go. Aw, I know. What are you talking about? I like that he's hairy. Oh? Hairy, you say? Yeah, scruffy's, like, cute. It's like, ""Hi, lam adorable, but I'm also an animal."" You know? Yeah, I know. Oh, yeah, right. Miles! We're on our way. Yeah, I know he's a little short, but I don't know, you know that famous saying... Theo! Come on! Let's go! ""Little things come in big packages,"" or whatever. Oh, man. It's like that. THEODORE: I think she liked me. (GRUNTS) I, like, could be doing so many more important things right now. I could be, I don't know, getting a pedicure? I'm looking for some chipmunks. Guys, their reservation was at 8:00. So, we still might have time to save the proposal. Come on, let's go. Go! AGENT SUGGS: Listen to me, I know these chipmunks are here. This is a badge for the United States government, okay? ALVIN: Okay, guys, here's the plan... So, I need for you... SIMON: Oh, no. It's Suggs! He found us. Theodore, get up! Uh-oh! Miles, you gotta get the ring to Dave! I'm not leaving you guys. We'll distract him. Just go! Run, run! Theo! Hurry! Get back here! THEODORE: I'm going as fast as I can! SIMON: Think of donuts, think of donuts! THEODORE: Donuts? Whoo-hoo! Go, Miles, go! Hurry! Run, run! Hide over here! Where? I don't know! Just think of something! Come on. Where are you? Where are you? Come on. Come on. Come on. Hi...ya. (GROWLS) See ya! Go, go, go! Run, run! Hurry, hurry! He's coming! Hurry, Alvin. Hit the button! Come on, Alvin! Hurry, hurry! (SIGHS) Whew! Ha! Here's Suggsy! (LAUGHS) He's like the Terminator! Yeah! (BREATHES DEEPLY) Oh, no. This is ironic. We're gonna be going up... but I'm taking you boys down. (SNICKERS) Now, here's what's gonna happen... I'm gonna turn you over to Homeland Security... and they're gonna put you in a zoo prison for dangerous animals. (GASPS) Oh, no. And then, if you ever get out of there... I'm gonna pay someone to have you stuffed. Right. And I'm gonna give you as a gift to Anna, who will hopefully take me back. Dude, I'm sorry, but it's over. You don't know that. Theo, let's go. I just think there's something wrong with her phone and she's not getting my texts... or the flowers, or my candy grams. And I, personally, don't think it's uncommon... for someone to move five times a year and change their number. Okay? It's normal. Oh, yeah. Totally normal. Alvin! What? What's going on? And that's our cue to leave. (GROANS) (ALARM RINGING) It has been a treat. No... What are you doing? Elevator power off. (YELLS) No! No! (GASPS) ALVIN: Excuse me! THEODORE: Pardon me! Miles! Hey. What happened to Officer Dingleberry? Let's just say his elevator got stuck. Has Dave proposed yet? No, but they're on dessert. It can't be long. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Oh, okay. You remember what to do? Yes, sir. Be no problem. There's the box. It's go time. Excuse me... young man, we have a strict no pets policy at this restaurant. I'm going to have to ask you to take your meerkats home. Meerkats! Esteban. Please escort these things out of the restaurant. All right, all right. Come on, guys. We know when we're not wanted. Evasive maneuvers! Nutmeg! He shoots, he scores! Nice, Alvin! MILES: Go, Alvin, go! Did you hear that? It sounded like somebody yelled ""Alvin."" Alley-OOP! Whoo-hoo! Pardon me! I think you're imagining it. Alvin! ALVIN: I'm open! Or not. MAN: Oh! Gotcha! Whoo-hoo! Cold! (SHOUTS) Whoa! Alvin? Oh. Hi there, Dave. Don't say it. Resist the urge. We all know you wanna say it, but hear me out. Miles? What? We can explain everything. Well, I can't wait to hear this. Dave, we came to Miami to stop you two from getting engaged. Oh, no. I just blew the surprise. But, and this is the part that I'd like you to focus on... when Theodore got hit by a car... Theodore got hit by a car? I did. He's fine. He was saving Miles' life. Wait, he what? The point is, we realized that... we like the idea of you two being together, and we changed our minds. Yep. ALVIN: It might not be the family in the photo that comes with the frame... but it's gonna be our family. And we're proud of it. Guys, that ring isn't mine. So, you're not proposing? I'm sorry, Samantha. I'm not. Oh, thank God. I mean, that's not what I meant. You know. I mean, not that I couldn't see it happening someday. I mean, uh... Not that I'm expecting it to happen. But I mean, if it did happen... I'm spiraling, aren't I? A little. What I mean is... I would love it if we could just take our time because... I really want it to work. Me, too. ALVIN: I'm very confused right now. You brought this ring to Miami and you said you had to come to dinner, so... I was holding it for Barry. My sound engineer. He's proposing to his girlfriend, Alice, at the restaurant right now... with an empty ring box. Oh, my God. Will you marry me? It's not empty. A breath mint? (SPANISH MUSIC PLAYING) Miss Grey, over here. When are you going back on tour? MAN: The greenroom is right this way, Mr. Seville. The only reason we're not headed back to LA right now is because... I have to be here. As soon as the show is over, we're all going home. I don't think I've ever been more disappointed in you guys than I am right now. If Dave didn't wanna get rid of us before, he definitely does now. All because we only cared about if we were happy. Maybe it's a chipmunk thing, like hoarding, you know? Maybe we're emotional hoarders? Actually, chipmunks are traditionally very caring creatures. Oh, nuts. Well, that means it's us. I'd do anything to fix this. Wait. Maybe we can fix it. By doing the one thing we do best! Cause mischief on land, sea and air? Eat all of Dave's food? No! Music! When words aren't enough, we sing! So let's give Dave one last song to show him how we really feel about him. Miles, start working on that little country riff you were doing in Texas. Where are you going? There's so much to do. I need to talk to Wardrobe, we need to... If we are gonna bring down the house, we're gonna need some backup. ♪ Once upon a time I was fallin' in love Oh, boy. ♪ Now it's only fallin' apart Oh, okay. ♪ Nothin' I can say ♪ A total eclipse of the heart 4' Ooh! (SCREAMS) Um, well... You're going to Hollywood! (SHRIEKS) Alvin! I'm going to Hollywood! I'm going to Hollywood! Sorry, girls, I've always wanted to say that. What are you doing here? Yeah. We're kind of in the middle of auditions. I need your help. We really screwed up with Dave and we gotta fix it. Because it's for Dave, we're in. ANNOUNCER: Please give a warm welcome... for Miss Ashley Grey! (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Thank you, guys- Now, I have a very special surprise for you... which was a surprise to me as well until just now. Everybody, welcome The Chipmunks! (CHEERING) Thanks, Ashley. Thanks. Thank you. ALVIN: Um... Before we perform, my brothers and I have a few things to set straight. Earlier this evening... we accidentally ruined a very special evening... for a very special woman and we'd like to make it up to her. Yeah. Alice? Barry has something he'd like to ask you. Again. Will you marry me this time? Yes. ALL: Aw. Yes. (APPLAUDING) Thanks, Chipmunks. And we just had one more quick thing to say. Dave... We're really sorry. We're sorry.

Guys, we have to get back to auditions. Ryan's been texting me like crazy. Come on, girls. Let's roll. Bye, Theodore-able. (GIGGLES) Miles, that was amazing! Dave, we're so sorry we came to Miami without telling you. We just didn't wanna lose you. Lose me? Why would you guys ever think you were gonna lose me? Because you said you're starting a new chapter in your life. We thought you might bail on us. Technically, we're not even a family. We're just three chipmunks who live with you. Is that what you guys think? I mean, I know I haven't really been around much lately, and... things are changing for us, but I'd never bail on you guys. Because we are a family. You're stuck with me whether you like it or not. And I was probably a little over-the-top on the whole ""no music"" thing, okay? You guys can perform. All right! But locally. Okay? Sure! And I promise to be a better dad from here on out. What are you talking about, Dave? You're the best dad we could ever have. What do you say to a little family dinner when we get home? You know, so we know where our kids are the entire time we're together? That sounds perfect. Whoo-hoo! We rocked it! Simon, did you see me? I was on fire! Oh. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I had fun getting in trouble with you guys. The trip might be over, but as long as Alvin is around, we'll always get into trouble. Thanks,SH Not a compliment. Oh, my God, you guys were awesome. Hey, Miles, right? WOW, you played great! Thanks! Your cool song... I mean... I love when... Music with your mouth... Oh, brother. Uh... You're great. Thank you. Phew! She bought it. Anyways, I have this party I'm supposed to go to in L.A. Saturday night... if, um, maybe you'd wanna... Definitely, yeah. I'd, definitely would like to... Yes. Definitely. Oh. Okay. Well then I'll definitely, definitely see you there. Okay. Bye. Bye. ALVIN: (CHUCKLES) Smooth, Miles. Real smooth. Bye. All right! Hey, ready? Yeah. Bye, guys. Come on, guys. Let's go home. Should we remind him we're on the No-Fly List? Definitely not. THEODORE: Um, this doesn't look like home. It's not. We have one more important thing to do before we go home. Oh, Dave, we've been driving for three days! Can't it wait? Unfortunately not, boys. The courthouse is closed tomorrow. I'm sorry, the what house? Are we going to jail? We didn't mean to cause an emergency landing, Dave! It was freezing in cargo! Does this look like a face that will survive prison? Come on. Dave Seville? Yep, that's me. By signing this... you not only agree to take care of, but to provide for the health, welfare and educational needs... of Alvin, Simon and Theodore. I do. Alvin, Simon and Theodore, do you agree to this adoption? Adoption? (GASPS) That's why we're here? You're adopting us? You guys were right. Even though you consider me to be your dad, and... I love you like my own sons, it's never been official. So I figured... let's make it official. Chipmunks? Yes? I still need you to say something like ""I agree."" Just to make it legal. Oh, yeah! I agree! Yeah. Me, too! 1,000%! And that's not even a real number. (LAUGHS) Does this mean we're Sevilles? On this day... David Seville has officially adopted Alvin, Simon and Theodore to be his children. You three now have all the legal rights of any natural child. Or, chipmunk. I hereby sign this order confirming this adoption. Congratulations. Thank you. Whoo-hoo! Yay! This is amazing! Yes! Guys, guys... Just... Up high, Judge. Give me some. Whoo-hoo! I'm so happy! Awesome! Dave! Whoa! Sweet! Yes! We're a family! We have a dad. Legally. Okay. Okay, all right. Alvin, okay. What an amazing day! (ALL LAUGHING) They're excited. Yes! Hey, official and legal Dad? Yes, official and legal son? Thanks for being the best official and legal dad, Dad. Well, you three are the best official and legal sons an official and legal father could ask for. Aw. That's sweet of you to say, Dad. Yeah. But seriously, guys, this is the happiest day of my life. Literally nothing could ruin it for me. (SQUIRRELS SQUEAKING) Oh, boy. (GASPS) Alvin.

s Voice, This ain't fair! Oww-hoo-hoo! Mama!
Penny, What was that supposed to be? (falls back) Heh heh heh heh!
Rolly, It was the most pitiful bark I've heard yet.
Pepper," Yeah, it sounded like someone sat on a squeaky toy!"
Wholesome Tommy," Ahh, Thunderbolt, you're one-of-a-kind!"
Patch, (whispering) Wow! One-of-a-kind!
Pongo," All right, bedtime, everyone."
Pups, Awwww!
Penny," But, Dad, (yawns) we're not sleepy yet."
Anita," Nanny, do you have the new dog tags?"
Nanny, (pulls out bag of tags) Right here. We'll put them on as they come up the stairs.
Kanine Krunchies spokesman," Say, kiddies! Is your dog a one-of-a-kind wonder dog?"
Kanine Krunchies spokesman," If you think your pooch has what it takes, bring him down to the London set of Thunderbolt's exciting new adventure, ""Thunderbolt Versus the Hound of the Baskervilles."""
Patch, Thunderbolt's in London?
Kanine Krunchies spokesman, That's right! Thunderbolt's in London. Just follow a Kanine Krunchies truck down to (motions to empty stage in the park) tomorrow's auditions where one lucky pup will win the opportunity to appear as a guest on the show.
Patch, Dad! Dad! Dad!
Pongo," 56, 57, 58... "
Pongo, Careful.
Pongo," 59, 60, 61, 62... 63, 64..."
Patch, Dad! Dad! I have to see Thunderbolt! 
Pongo," J-J-Just a minute, son. I'm counting."
Patch," But, Dad! 67, 68, 69... "
Patch, I've seen every episode... all 72. 
Pongo," 72, 73... 2? Uh...(chuckles) Not now, Patch. I'm busy losing count here! 76, 77, 78, 79..."
Patch," But, Dad! Dad! (gets knocked back by his siblings) Whoa!"
Pongo," 81, 82, 83... "
Pongo," Oh, dear. (goes down stairs and counts remaining pups) Uh, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and Patch, 105. 105? (to Patch) Are you all right, son?"
Patch," Dad, I've just got to see Thunderbolt tomorrow."
Pongo," Yes, I know, but tomorrow is moving day. You're going to love it on the farm, son. There are big green fields and a stream and a barn and lots of different animals. (smirks) Hey, maybe you and I can chase some chickens, huh?"
Patch," (tries to smile) Uh, sure, Dad, but..."
Nanny," Here we go! ""Cherry Tree Farm, Little Tichfield, Devon."" Hmm. (brings him up stairs) Why, I imagine it's the most splendid farm in the whole country."
Pongo," Oh, Perdy, the farm will be such a wonderful place to raise our puppies."
Perdita," And best of all, we'll be miles away from that evil, ugly monster..."
Cruella, Cruella de Vil! 
Cruella," Now, please let me in!"
 Fenwick," I can't do that, Miss De Vil."
Cruella," Mr. Fenwick, please, something, anything."
 Fenwick, You know very well that the terms of your probation...(manages to close the door and then locks it) don't allow me to sell you any more furs.
Cruella, Not even a stole? A muff? (slides down glass of door) A pair of mittens?
 Fenwick, No!
Cruella, (cracking voice) One mitten?
 Fenwick, No!
Cruella, Could things possibly be any worse?
Cruella," (kicking the radio violently) Shut up, shut up, shut up! "
Cruella, What does Cruella de Vil have left to live for?
Aristocrat, Good grief!
face with what she saw," a huge white board with a big, black painted dot in its center. Then a man came approaching behind her."
Lars, Tell me...what do you see?
Cruella," Everything. Darkness and light, form and content."
Lars, And what else?
Cruella," Chaos and order, joy and pain."
Lars, And there is more than that?
Cruella," The possibility of triumph, the certainty of defeat, (reaches out) the culmination of all I've ever reached for, (tightens fist) but could not grasp! (laughs eagerly) I see everything! I see absolutely everything! I feel faint in the presence of such artistic truth. Where is the artist? I simply must meet him!"
Lars," But you already have. (turns and does odd motions) I am Lars, and I am an undiscovered genius."
Cruella," My name is Cruella de Vil, and I'm an overfinanced heiress."
Lars," Your passion for my work both repels (slides up to her, face-to-face) and attracts."
Cruella, Ooh.
Lars, Could you bear the sweet agony of seeing more?
Cruella, You mean there's more? 
Cruella, Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots!
Lars, I have yet to find anyone who truly understood their bleak but beautiful meaning...(does more motions with his arms) that is until I met you.
Cruella, This could be it! This could be the cure for my craving! My analyst said I should find something to substitute for my magnificent obsession. But who needs furs when I can soothe my tortured soul with art?
Lars, Something tortures you? Tell me what cloud dares cast a shadow on the flower.
Cruella," Oh, it's a sad but familiar tale of loss and disappointment, probation, and a restraining order. (laughs a bit) But you, you can help Cruella to forget all that. (dramatically) Will you do a painting just for me to ease my pain?"
Lars, I will create a masterpiece...if you will be my... muse.
Cruella," Ooh. Oh, darling."
Pongo, (talking in his sleep) 6...7...26... 202. 
Patch, Dad? 
Pongo, 97... 
Patch, I can't sleep. 
Pongo, 98...
Patch, I've been thinking. 
Pongo, 90... 
Patch, Do you think I'm one-of-a-kind...or just...one of 101? 
Pongo, (yawns) 101. That's it. 101. 
s Voice," All right, everyone, into the truck! "
s Voice," You're 90, you're 91, you're 92, you're 93, you're 94. Hold it. Wait. "
s Voice," You're 98, you're 99...you're 100...and you're 101. "
Pongo," And you're 101, and you're 101. Hold it. Wait. How many 101s are there? Well, I've successfully lost count again. Right. Anyone not here, speak up. "
Patch," Oh, no! "
Patch, Wait! Wait for me! 
Patch," Well, that figures. They didn't even miss me. "
Patch, (smirks) Then I'm not gonna miss them! 
Roger," Well, what do you think? "
Anita," (hugs Roger) Why, it's splendid! "
Roger," Puppies, welcome to your new home! "
Pongo, Right then. (as two puppies started heading down first) That's 1 and 2 and...
Pongo," Uh...37, 36, 5, 50, 8, um...minus 2, carry the 3, and, um...(after the puppies were out) 101? "
Perdita," Finally, no more counting. "
Frog, Huh? Waaa! 
Roger," All this place needs is a proper dusting, a splash of paint, (stops pushing the piano) and it'll be good as new. Now, where do you suppose we'll put the music room? "
Anita," I think you just found it, darling. "
Theme Song Chorus, (singing) Thunderbo-olt
Theme Song Chorus, (singing) Thunderbo-olt
Producer," Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pooches and pups of all ages, are you ready? "
Producer," Desperadoes, cringe in fear. Mighty Thunderbolt is here! "
Patch, I don't believe it! It's really him! 
Producer," And here's his sidekick extraordinaire, the ever-trusty Little Lightning! "
Poodle, Yoo-hoo! 
Lightning," Oh, uh, hi, ladies. Nice to meet you. "
Poodle," Oh, no."
Poodle, Get out of the way. We want... 
Thunderbolt, (jumps up in front of them) Thunderbolt! 
Dog fangirls, (swooning) Oooh.
Thunderbolt," Sorry, little buddy, but these ladies aren't interested in the sidekick. "
Thunderbolt, They're here to get a big eyeful of...(as the girl dogs started shaking happily) hero! 
Dog fangirls, Aaah! 
Thunderbolt," Heel, ladies, heel. "
Producer," All right, everybody. Line up your dogs for the audition. We need to hear their best heroic bark. "
Thunderbolt, V-Very good. 
Thunderbolt," Hey, that's very...(as the hound starts howling again) Oh, there's more! "
Thunderbolt, (still grinning) Well...go ahead. 
Patch, (looks at the crowd) Uh... 
Thunderbolt," What's the matter, little fella? Cat got your tongue? (bursts out laughing) Oh, that's funny, 'cause, you see, we're dogs...and we chase cats, so... "
Thunderbolt," Ah, well, it made me laugh. (under his breath) Come on, kid, we haven't got all year. You're wasting my valuable limelight. "
Thunderbolt," Say, who sat on the squeaky toy? "
Reporter," Hey, Thunderbolt, over here!"
Chorus, (singing) Thunderbo-olt...
Producer," That's it, folks! We'll announce the winner of the audition tomorrow! "
Producer," Have a mega-fantabulous day! And remember, buy your pooch lots and lots of tasty Kanine Krunchies! "
Chorus, (singing/distorting) ...only in the night
Patch," Nice work, Patch, just brilliant. "
Thunderbolt," Ladies, ladies, you're wearing me out. "
Poodle," Oh, please? Just do it one more time. "
Thunderbolt," Oh, well, all right. I guess just one more time couldn't hurt. "
Thunderbolt," (enters his trailer via the doggy flap) Golly, I'm good. "
Thunderbolt," Hello, boys! "
Lightning, Thunder!
Thunderbolt," Lightning, little buddy. "
Lightning, It's just awful! 
Lightning, I overheard what they're planning for the next episode.
Thunderbolt, Growl! (winces at toy villain falling) Bump! 
Thunderbolt," Ah, don't be too harsh on them, little buddy. I know we don't have the best writers in television but we can always improvise. I'm pretty good at improvising, as long as it's written down for me. "
Lightning," No, no, you don't understand. Something really horrible is going to happen. "
Thunderbolt," Ooh, ooh, don't tell me. Let me guess. The dam breaks. "
Lightning, No.
Thunderbolt, The mine collapses.
Lightning, No. 
Thunderbolt, (eagerly) Do I get an evil twin? I've always wanted an evil twin. 
Lightning," No! Listen, Thunder, what happens is you...you... "
Thunderbolt, Huh? 
Lightning, You die. 
Thunderbolt, I don't believe it. I- I die? 
Thunderbolt," (wistfully) Oh, Lightning, this is just...(mood changes abruptly) about the greatest thing ever! Ha ha! I've always wanted to play a big death scene. The selfless hero who sacrifices himself to save the innocent. Ha ha! I'll kick bigger than Old Yeller! Ha ha ha! So, how do I make my shockingly unexpected and triumphant return? "
Lightning, You don't.
Thunderbolt, What do you mean 'I don't'? 
Lightning, You don't make a shockingly unexpected and triumphant return. You die. You're dead. You never come back. 
Thunderbolt, Not even for a reunion show? 
Lightning, Not even for a cameo in the remake. 
Thunderbolt, (gasps in horror) They're writing me out of the show! 
Lightning, They're gonna replace you with a younger dog. 
Thunderbolt," Oh, so that's what those auditions were really all about. Oh, Lightning, you gotta help me. I can't end up on the street, homeless, foraging in trash cans. (gets up in Lightning's face) Mange! I could get mange! "
Lightning," Well, I...I did have this one crazy thought. "
Thunderbolt," Or ticks! I hate ticks! (gets in Lightning's face again) They suck all the blood out of you, do you hear me? They suck all the blood out of yoooou! "
Lightning," What if...you went out and did something heroic like you do on the show, but in the real world? You know, get your name in the paper, prove to 'em that you still got it. "
Thunderbolt, Wait a minute. What if...I went out and did something heroic in the real world? 
Lightning," (rolls eyes) Or...that could work, too. After all, you are the one-of-a-kind wonder dog. How hard could it be? "
Thunderbolt," Yeah, it'll be a catwalk."
Lightning, Cakewalk. 
Thunderbolt," Pre-cisely. I'll just go get a little|press for doing some easy hero stuff and they'll be begging to keep me on the show. But first, I'll have to figure out a way to sneak past my adoring public. "
Thunderbolt," Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak. (hides behind a tree) Hide. "
Thunderbolt, Hmm. Ha ha. Master of disguise. 
Patch," Hi, Thunderbolt!"
Thunderbolt," Aaaaah! Oh, I'm sorry. You've got the wrong dog, kid. "
Patch," I know it's you. That's the same disguise you used in episode 18, ""Gambling Gophers of Gunfire Gulch."" "
Thunderbolt, Oh! For howling out loud! Now you've blown my cover. 
Patch," This is champion! I'm your biggest fan, Thunderbolt! "
Patch, I know every episode by heart. 
Patch," Remember the time when you fought that grizzly bear, and rescued those orphans, and then the dam broke and...and... "
Thunderbolt," Hey, aren't you the squeaky toy? "
Patch, (nervously) Yeah. Heh. That's me. 
Thunderbolt," Listen, pup..."
Patch, Patch. 
Thunderbolt," Pooch, whatever. You've got to understand, (poses boldly) sometimes danger and I like to dance alone! "
Thunderbolt," Good gracious gravy, look at that! A cat is stuck up in that tree! "
Patch, He is? 
Thunderbolt," Oh, my heart goes out to the poor, helpless creature. Now, if I were me, what would I do? Well, I'd read the script. That's what I'd do. (gasps and eyes widen in horror) Oh, no! I don't have a script! "
Patch, This is just like when Tommy was trapped on that cliff in episode 29. 
Patch, That one was a classic.
Thunderbolt," (to himself) Okay, okay, don't panic. You can do this. "
Patch, Only it's also like episode 64...
Thunderbolt, You can do this. 
Patch, When he was drowning in the water tower.
Thunderbolt, You can't do this!
Patch," Yeah, that was great."
Thunderbolt, You can't do this! Who am I kidding? I have no idea what I'm doing! 
Patch," But episode 29 is still the best, at least from the first season. "
Thunderbolt, Pooch!
Patch, Patch. 
Thunderbolt, Whatever. I'm trying to panic here!
Patch," Oh, sorry. I just thought you were gonna do what you did on Raccoon Ridge. "
Patch," You know, when you got that barrel and dragged it next to the cliff, and you found a long plank of wood, and got a great, big, round boulder..."
Patch, And then...
Thunderbolt, Pre-cisely! 
Thunderbolt," Hang on, little kitty! Help is on the way! Heh heh heh. The press is gonna love this. "
Cat, Phew. 
Thunderbolt," (sees the cat) There you are, my good man. No need to thank me. The look on your face is thanks enough. "
Thunderbolt, Now smile for the cameras. 
Thunderbolt," Hey, that's strange. (grin fades) Where are all the photographers? The press is always around when I do something. (annoyed) What's the matter with you English people? Are you all having tea? (gets off the cat) How am I supposed to get my job back if you're all having tea?!"
Patch," That was champion, Thunder, just like on the telly! "
Thunderbolt," You know, this stuff isn't as easy as it looks. "
Thunderbolt," I mean, maybe if I could remember what happened in every episode of the show, you know, like squeaky toy here, then I could... "
Thunderbolt," Hey, squeaky toy. "
Cruella," (grins) Oh, darling, it's just divine! It's remarkable! It's stunning! It's grand! "
Cruella, (grin disappears) But it's all wrong. 
Lars," But...but it--it's my best work yet, Cupcake. "
Cruella," But it simply has to be better than your best, darling. I mean, look at these spots. (marks X over a spot with the smoke from her cigarette) Oh, the shapes aren't at all acceptable. They're not (affectionately about something) soft enough. You know, cuddly, like something you want to (clenches fists) squeeze the life out of! Oh, no, this one is no good at all, an embarrassing mediocrity, a complete failure! "
Lars, Your harsh words strike me like blows from the fists of a large dockworker. (childishly) I would cry now...(acts cool) were it not so bourgeois. 
Cruella," (pats his head) There, there. I know you'll get it right, my depressive Da Vinci. You simply have to keep trying. After all, you're the only one who truly understands Cruella, who can see into her tortured soul. "
Lars," Yes! Her heart is like a vast, dark ocean on whose waves (holds her hand and looks into her eyes) I am hopelessly adrift in my dinghy of passion. "
Lars," I shall not betray your faith in me! I shall create another canvas, and another, and another, and another until I have found spotted perfection! "
Lars, I shall not stop until the fires of your craving have been quenched! 
Patch, Junior deputy test? Which episode was that in? 
Thunderbolt," Uh, one of the lost episodes. But I only give it to pups who I think might be worthy. And who knows? If you do real good, maybe I'll even let you|be on the show with me. "
Patch, Really? 
Thunderbolt," Sure, kid. I'm the star, aren't I? "
Thunderbolt," Mother of pasteurised milk! That stagecoach is out of control! (to Patch) This is your first junior deputy test, kid. "
Patch," Okay. Well...this is just like in episode 37, ""Stagecoaches of Serpent Summit."" "
Thunderbolt," Very good. Now, episode 37, was that the one where I leap, run, and pounce? "
Patch," No, no. That was the one where you run, pounce, and leap. "
Thunderbolt, Pre-cisely! Stand back! 
Thunderbolt," Get hold of yourself, man! You're out of control! "
Driver, Whoa! 
Thunderbolt, It's okay! I'll get the brake. 
Thunderbolt, Still no photographers. How odd.
 he finished his newest artwork," a painting that had two diagonal rows of spots, with the size smaller as the rows went up. He was on a ladder showing his new work to his muse, and she only lay on the couch, giving an impressed shake of her head meaning 'no' before she continued smoking. Lars then went back down the ladder to try and whip up something else."
Thunderbolt," Here's your next test, kid. "
Patch, Wow! Bank robbers! 
Patch," Uh, Episode 4. "
Thunderbolt, (as he bounces) Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
Both, Aaaaaah!
Thunderbolt, Hmm? Still no photographers? 
 That feedback was this, the still-unimpressed Cruella taking a magazine she had and covering her face with it.
Patch, Those men are frozen with fear. 
Thunderbolt, No wonder. Those crazed badgers are trying to eat their heads! 
Patch, It's just like in episode 27 when you whupped those two grizzlies! 
Guards, (sensing their hats gone) Huh? 
Patch, What is it? 
Thunderbolt, Looks like we've stumbled on a band of cattle rustlers. 
Patch," Uh, aren't those monkeys? "
Thunderbolt," Even worse, monkey rustlers! "
Patch, Sounds like episode 34 to me. 
Thunderbolt," Right answer once again, junior deputy. "
Patch, I passed the test?
Thunderbolt, Think you can handle it? 
Patch, You bet! Let's get those monkey rustlers! 
Cruella, (sticks tongue out) Blech! 
Thunderbolt," Hey, get over on the right side of the road, buddy! Sheesh! London drivers. "
Patch," I told you, Thunder. (chomps one of the sausages) This is the best day ever! "
Thunderbolt," Yeah. You know, I never knew it would be so much fun out here, doing this real hero stuff. "
Patch, What do you mean? Don't you do this all the time? 
Thunderbolt," Oh, well, kid, uh...Well, you know, it's, uh... "
Thunderbolt," Of course I do! Ha! I do this all the time. So, let's talk about you, kid. "
Patch, Me? 
Thunderbolt, Yeah. What's your story?
Patch," Well, uh... "
Thunderbolt, Hold on. 
Thunderbolt," (with mouth full) Okay, go on. "
Producer, Missing?! What do you mean 'he's missing'?!
Security Guard, We've looked.
Schedule Writer, And looked.
Producer," (shakes third crew member) This is a catastrophe, (rips up schedule) a calamity, (shoves security guard down) a cataclysm! "
Producer, We have to shoot first thing in the morning and I find out my star is missing! (high voice) How can you shoot a show without a star? (slams head against trailer door) How...can you shoot...a show without...a star? 
Assistant," How do you spell ""cataclysm""? "
Producer, (slumps back against door in despair) How can you shoot a show without a star? How can you shoot a show without a... 
Producer, A star. (takes picture) This is it. This is megafantabulous! 
Producer," We'll rewrite this episode and star Little Lightning! I'm a genius! Get the writers! Fire the director! This is going to be a whole new direction for ""The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour""! "
Lightning," A whole new direction. (to a life-size Thunderbolt plush) What do you think of that, Thunderbolt, ""old pal""? Finally I'll be able to step out of your shadow, (pushes the plush down) you overrated, overacting ham! "
Lightning," ""The Little Lightning Adventure Hour""! It has a nice ring, doesn't it? Hmm? What do you think? "
Lars," I have failed you, my muse. "
Lars," Oh, fickle bird of inspiration, (uses his hands to mimic bird flapping) to what far shore have you flown? "
Cruella," Oh, poor, pathetic Lars, do not despair. I know exactly where to find the inspiration we crave. Oh, this is art, after all. Art! Our creativity cannot be thwarted by trivial matters like restraining orders. Yes! Sacrifices must be made! "
Cruella, Gone? They're all gone? How unspeakably rude of Anita to move away without even leaving a forwarding address. 
Cruella," Oh, Lars, now what am I to do? "
Cruella," Why, you little..."
Cruella, What's this? 
Cruella," I know you. Oh, this is delicious! (reads the collar) ""Cherry Tree Farm, Little Tichfield, Devon."" "
Anita," (chuckles) Oh, no. "
Anita," Freckles, dear, stop helping. "
Nanny," (gasps) Oh, my! The tea! "
Roger," Uhh! Yes, the paper. "
Roger, No time to read this if I'm going to finish my new song. 
Patch," Well, I come from this really big family. "
Thunderbolt," I knew a guy who came from a big litter, 10 or 12. I forget. "
Patch, (glumly) There's 101 of us. 
Thunderbolt," 101 Dalmatians? Hey, I heard about you guys. Yeah, you were on the Twilight Bark. "
Patch," Well, that's just it, isn't it? I'm afraid all I'll ever be is one of 101. At least that's what my dad thinks. "
Patch," Hey, Thunderbolt, how do you become a one-of-a-kind wonder dog anyway? "
Thunderbolt," Well, in my case, it all hinged on getting just the right agent. But, you know, kid, getting there isn't so tough. (gives an angry frown) It's staying on top that's the real challenge. You think you're doing great... ...and all of a sudden there's somebody trying to take your place. "
Patch, (gives an equally mad frown) Crowd you out.
Thunderbolt, Push you aside. 
Patch, Steal your spot! 
Thunderbolt, Pre-cisely! 
Patch, Pre-cisely! 
Thunderbolt," You know, you're all right, kid. "
Thunderbolt," I'll tell you what, little buddy, I'm planning on doing some more big-hero stuff today. You stick with me. (as they look at their reflections in the water) Maybe you'll get your picture in the paper, show the world that you're not just another dog. "
Thunderbolt," No, no, no, like this. Ahem. "
Penny, Uh-oh. 
Roger, What? Patch? In London? 
Nanny, Don't you worry. I'll keep an eye on things here. 
Pongo, This is all my fault. If only I hadn't lost count. 
Perdita," Oh, stop blaming yourself, dear. The important thing now is that we find him before Cruella De Vil does. "
Jasper," It's not fair, Horace, me lad. It's just not fair. How come she gets off with probation and a restraining order... "
Horace, (finishing Jasper's sentence) While we's left rottin' away in here?
Bobby," Off your bums, lads. Sprung for your bail, somebody has. "
Horace, (claps hands) It must be Mum come to spring us. 
Jasper, Mum never liked me. It must be good ol' Dad. 
Horace, Dad never liked you either. 
Cruella," Jasper, Horace! "
Both, (hide behind cop) Aah!
Cruella, It's time to finish the job. 
Horace," Oh, no, not her! We always get the worst end of it with her. "
Jasper," Well, if she wants us to work for her this time, we won't be made fools of. "
Horace, You look just like Mum. 
Jasper," Shut up, you! (to Cruella) I ain't going through with this, I tell you! I ain't! "
Cruella, Here he comes now! 
Jasper, (as he's shoved) Whoa! 
Horace," (motioning/quietly) Go on, Jasper. "
Cruella, (motioning/quietly) Go! Go on! Go! 
Driver," Afternoon, love. Something I can..."
Driver, Aah! 
Jasper," (falsetto voice) Hello, there! "
Driver," Uh, uh, something I can do for a pretty young lady like yourself? "
Jasper," Of course you can, you naughty man! "
Jasper, You can just (normal yet threatening voice) give me this truck! 
Driver, (alarmed) What?!
Horace," (gleefully/quietly) Whoo-hoo! (turns to Jasper) They're all inside, Jasper. Go ahead and start it up. "
Nanny, Whatever in the world? 
Rolly, Hmm? 
Spotty, Ow! 
Spotty," Hey, where's he going? "
Both, Kanine Krunchies!
Pup," Hey, it's Kanine Krunchies! "
Pups," (randomly) Oh, my! Yippee! Mmm! Yummy! Whoo-hoo."
Horace," It worked, Jasper."
Jasper," Ha ha! Like a dream, Horace, me lad. (mimicking like he was dreaming) Like a dream. "
s Voice, You?!
Nanny, I should have known it was you terrible men! Now let those puppies go right now or I'm going to knock the stupid out of both of you! 
Jasper," Here now, lady. We don't want to have to hurt you none. So... "
Horace, Aaah! 
Horace, Come on! 
Jasper," Right. That's it, then! (kicks one of the pigs and straightens his dress) I've had just about enough of this! "
Nanny," (in worry) Ohh! Oh, no! "
Jasper," There, now. That ought to hold you right proper. "
Horace, Jasper. 
Jasper, What? 
Horace, Can we just go back to jail now? 
Cruella, Your muse has returned! 
Lars, But I am a failure. You should despise me. 
Cruella," (as Jasper and Horace set the boxes down) Oh, stop being such a wet blanket and come see what I've brought for you. "
Lars," (brightens up) A gift...(grins) For me? (grin disappears) How very ""Christmas morning with the twinkle lights"" of you. "
Cruella, A gift of inspiration! 
Lars," Well, of course. These are only... "
Lars, ...just about the most adorable little puppies... I've ever seen in my whole life! Look at these cute little darlings! 
Lars," (rubs noses with the puppy) Oh, a fuzzy wuzzy little puppy poo! Poo-poo. Little puppy poo. "
Lars, Did you see that? 
Lars, Did you see that? He gave me a widdle kissy! I'm gonna kiss him back. 
Jasper, (to Horace) He's havin' a wobbly. 
Lars," And you mean for me to do a painting of them, don't you? That's an absolutely lovely idea! It makes me smile a lot. "
Cruella," ""Painting of them,"" he says. "
Cruella," No, no, no, darling. I don't want you to make art of the puppies, I want you to make art WITH the puppies. (hugs herself) Use their coats as canvases. Create a masterpiece in a new medium. "
Cruella, Together you and I will stun the art world with our ruthless originality! 
Lars, But that means... 
Lars, How could you do such a thing to the cute little puppies?!
Jasper, Poison them.
Horace, Drown them. 
Cruella, Bash them in the head. 
Lars," I may be eccentric, but I am not a sicko! "
Cruella, What?
Lars, You'll not hurt one spot on these innocent little creatures' heads! Not as long as I have anything to say about it! 
Cruella," I thought you were a man of vision, someone who understood my passions, who understood the complexity that is Cruella! (grabs scalpels) Does no one get the point?!"
Cruella," Oh, Lars. You're such a disappointment. Oh, well. If I can't have a masterpiece, at least I'll finally have a fabulous Dalmatian coat. That's almost as good. Don't you agree? "
 They all whined before one of them knew what to do," start barking. The pup started barking and some of the others joined in, and that started off the Twilight Bark from before. Outside the warehouse, a woman walked her dog, and the little dog heard the barking. She yipped in response, and the woman holding onto her lead was turned around."
Kids, Aah!
Bulldog, Kidnapped? How many? 
Thunderbolt, I just can't understand it. We've been out here doing hero stuff all day and none of these London photographers...(sighs) seem to care. 
Patch, Why do you want photographers around? 
Thunderbolt," Aw, kid. Look, I got something to tell you. Something I guess I should have told you a long time ago. "
Thunderbolt," Oh, I don't know how to say this, but the truth is... "
Patch," Thunderbolt, listen! There's an emergency! "
Thunderbolt," Sounds like a kidnapping! Hmm. Being held in a warehouse. A devil woman! 101 Dalmatians. Hey, what a coincidence. You come from a family of 101, too. "
Thunderbolt," What...what's the matter, kid? "
Patch, That is my family. Cruella must have them again. 
Thunderbolt, Cruella? 
Patch, (leaps off trash can) The devil woman! She's the one who kidnapped us before. 
Patch," Oh, this is awful. What am I going to do? Wait a second...Thunderbolt! You'll help us, won't you? "
Thunderbolt," Yes...well, kid, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. You see, I'm not really a... "
Thunderbolt," Of course I'll help you, Patch. Yeah! The world-famous Thunderbolt rescues the world-famous 101 Dalmatians. "
Thunderbolt, Ha! Sounds like a good story to me. Newsworthy even. Come on! We'll let them know I'm on my way. The villains will soon cringe in fear! Mighty Thunderbolt is here! 
Poodle," Oh, it's just wonderful. I heard it through the Twilight Bark. Tell all. Thunderbolt is going to save those little Dalmatian puppies. "
Poodle, That's right. 
Lightning," More like a nightmare. What if ""Blunderbolt"" gets lucky and succeeds? If the press got wind of that...(stares at Thunderbolt standee) I- I'd never be rid of him. "
Thunderbolt, Look! That must be the warehouse. 
Patch, Let's try over there. 
Patch," (referring to the fire escape ladder) Hey, do you think you can reach that? "
Thunderbolt, No problem. 
Lightning," (racing to the two) Thunderbolt, old pal! "
Patch, Lightning? 
Thunderbolt, Lightning! What are you doing here? 
Lightning, I came as soon as I heard. Thought you might need a bit of help. 
Thunderbolt," Thanks for coming, little buddy. "
Lightning, Wouldn't miss it.
Jasper, What's that supposed to be? 
Horace," Oh, leave us alone, Jasper. I think it's kind of pretty. "
Thunderbolt," So, what's the plan, kid? "
Patch," See those guards? I think you can sneak past them. Remember the end of episode 39, ""The Flight From the Forbidden Fort""? "
Thunderbolt," The one where I ran, jumped, and sprang? "
Patch," No, no, sneaked, evaded, and triumphed. "
Thunderbolt," Oh, yeah! Of course! I get it. "
Lightning," Hey, you're a pretty smart kid. That's a good plan: stealthy. But we don't need any of that. "
Lightning, This is Thunderbolt! Villains always cringe in fear whenever Thunderbolt is here! 
Thunderbolt, So true. 
Lightning, What we need is a full-frontal assault! How hard can it be? 
Thunderbolt, That's right. How hard can it be? Follow me. 
Lightning," Oh, I'm right behind you, pal. "
Jasper, It sort of looks like you except you don't have that much hair. 
Tripod, It's Patch! And he's brought Thunderbolt! 
Jewel, He'll save us! 
Horace, Here now. Where did you come from? 
Jasper," Get outta here, you stupid mutt! "
Patch, Maybe they didn't hear you. 
Thunderbolt," Don't worry, kid. This will be...Take Two. "
Jasper and Horace, Aaaah!
Thunderbolt," (smirks) Ahh, that's more like it. "
Cruella," Ah! What have we here? Oh, it's you. "
Cruella," I owe you a debt of gratitude, my photogenic little friend. (picks him up) If it wasn't for you, I'd have never found your brothers and sisters. "
Cruella, And now I have you all. 
Patch," Thunder, are you playing dead? "
Thunderbolt, That hurt. That really hurt. 
Patch, (chuckles) I knew you were faking it. 
Lightning," He's been faking it, all right. "
Thunderbolt," Lightning, little buddy. "
Lightning," I am not your little buddy! And you are no wonder dog! This kid trusted you, and look where it's got him. "
Patch, What's he mean? 
Lightning," He's been lying to you all day, kid. He doesn't care about you or your family. He was just trying to get his name in the paper and save his job. Ask him."
Patch, Wha... 
Thunderbolt," No. Well, yeah, but...but... "
Lightning," (mockingly) But, but, but. Hey, genius, you're no hero! You're a fraud! "
Lightning," And by the way, there never was a plan to recast you. I just had to get you out of the way. "
Lightning," Now I got to go take your place on the show, MY show!"
Patch," Thunder. Thunder, I don't understand. You lied to me? "
Thunderbolt, (miserably) I put on an act. I'm an actor. (sighs) That's what I do. 
Patch, But you said I could be your junior deputy. 
Thunderbolt, I made all that up. I-I just needed someone who...who knew the script. 
Patch, But you...you said that you'd help us. 
Thunderbolt," Oh, don't you get it, kid? All that ""running around and saving the day"" stuff, it's...it's...it's make-believe. It's not real. "
Patch, (teary) You promised! 
Thunderbolt," Patch, I just... "
Patch, You lied. 
Thunderbolt," I'm sorry, all right? I'm not a real wonder dog. "
Thunderbolt, I just...acted like one once. 
Rolly, I'm hungry. 
Freckle, I want to go home. It's scary here. 
Penny, Where's mother? 
Lucky, Patch? Are you okay? Patch? 
Patch," (sighs) Dad was right. I am just one of 101. I'm sorry, Lucky. This is all my fault. "
Lucky," Hey, didn't Thunderbolt get out of a cage like this once? You know, in episode 13, ""The Flaming Flea Circus""? "
Patch, Episode 18. 
Patch, Episode 18! 
Penny, Did you see what Patch just did? 
Spotty," Wizard, Patch! Absolutely wizard! "
Jasper, Hey! Shut your yapping! I'm trying to get me beauty sleep. 
Patch," Okay, you guys. Stick together and be quiet. "
Cruella," Oh, don't look so put-out. My favourite furrier will be open in the morning and then we'll be out of your hair. "
Patch," Perfect. Episode 53, ""The Mine Shaft Mix-up."" (to his siblings) Everybody, stay here until I tell you it's safe to come out. "
Jasper," (in irritation) Aw, what is it with...(turns) Aah! "
Both, You let the puppies get away! 
Jasper, Hold on! They can't have gone far. Here.
Jasper, Start searching. 
Jasper," Oh, when that crazy bird finds out we lost them again, she'll skin us. "
Cruella," Horace, Jasper! What are you looking for? "
Jasper," Nothing, Mum. "
Horace, We haven't lost the doggies or anything. 
Cruella, You let them escape? 
Horace, Jasper fell asleep. 
Jasper, You were snoring like a train! 
Horace, The lift is barking. 
Cruella, The mutts must already be downstairs. 
Horace, Funny how we never heard the lift. 
Jasper," Shut up, you! "
Patch, Come on! They'll be back soon! 
Lucky, Aren't we going down? 
Patch," Nope, we're going up. "
Patch," Ready, Rolly? "
Rolly," Huh? (reluctantly) No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! "
Rolly, Can I do that again? 
Patch," Okay, now the rest of you. "
Horace, I'm just saying maybe the puppies are still upstairs...and they just tricked us into coming down here. 
Jasper," Come on now, Horace. Dogs ain't that smart. (points to his own brain) They haven't got the big educated brains we got. "
Patch, 97 away! 98 away! 
Patch, 99 away! 
Cruella, Ah-ha-ha!
Jasper, Get him! 
Patch, Who-o-o-o-a! 
Cruella, (growls in frustration) D'oh! 
Driver," Thanks, Gus. Cheers. "
Patch, Come on. We're gonna hitch a ride. 
Penny, Here they come! 
Cruella, There they are! Get them! 
Patch, What's happened? 
Fidget, She pushed me!
Penny, Did not! 
Patch, Who-o-o-o-a! 
Pepper, The crazy lady's right behind us! 
Horace, (as the pigeons flew right at him) Oh-ho-ho! Ow! Ohh! Ohh! 
Jewel, He had a birdie in his mouth. 
Cruella," Oh, you idiots! Here, take the wheel. "
Cruella," Speed up, you imbeciles, or we'll lose them! "
Pups, Aah! 
Rolly, Aaah! 
Cruella, Ha ha! That's one! Just 98 more to go! 
Producer," Okay, okay! Quiet on the set! We're rolling! And action, Wholesome Tommy! "
Wholesome Tommy," Aw, Lightning, you're one-of-a... "
Lucky, Aaaaah! 
Patch, Huh? 
Cruella, Hmm? 
Rolly," Patch, help me! "
Patch, Aah! 
Cruella," Well, well. If it isn't the little half-pint hero again. "
Cruella, Huh? 
Jewel, Wow! Check out Patch! 
Lightning, Aaah! 
Lightning and Pups, Aaaaaaaaah! 
Freckles," What do we do now, Patch? "
Patch, See those windows? We can reach them from the upper deck! 
Pongo, You go ahead. I'll hold them off...(timidly) s-somehow. 
Jasper, (chortles) Here's a feisty one. 
Patch, Thunderbolt! 
Thunderbolt," How are you doin', kid? "
Patch, But...but I thought... 
Thunderbolt, Come on! Haven't you seen the show? I always arrive just in the nick of time. 
Thunderbolt," Look, I may not be a real hero (winks) but I can act like one. "
Thunderbolt," Lightning, don't let 'em hurt me! "
Thunderbolt," Ooh, heart...Ugh! My heart! "
Thunderbolt," Lightning, this might be the end! "
Cruella, Give me that! I'll put this mongrel out of its misery! 
Jasper, Ugh! 
Horace, (with a dizzy grin on his face) Ugh! 
Thunderbolt," Lightning, I can feel the warm kiss of life..."
Thunderbolt, ...'ere it parts my cheek. 
Thunderbolt, Oh! (grabs Lightning's cheeks) Do not mourn me when I am gone! It is enough that you were here at the end. 
Thunderbolt, (faintly) Goodbye...old...friend. 
Lightning," (voice breaking) Good night, sweet prince. "
Lightning, Aaah! 
Cruella, Aah! 
Jasper, Aaah! 
Jasper, I got to get through here! 
s Voice, Dispatch to Car 47. What is your situation? Over.
Lightning," No, no! Fellas, I'm not with them! I was...I was trying to help Thunderbolt! Honest! That's what I do! I'm a sidekick! We're a team! "
Lightning," (sobbing) Come on, fellas! Come on! Don't you watch TV?"
Thunderbolt, Hmm. Now who's the pathetic ham actor?
Lars," I am painting spots, but she doesn't like them so good. And then she says, ""No, you must kill them!"" And I'm not so sturdy. She's very mean to me, and then I pass out. "
Nanny, There they are! Those are the ones!
Both, (pointing at Cruella) She made us do it! 
Cruella," Spots? (laughing insanely) I do see spots, you know. They're everywhere. "
Cruella," Spots, spots, spots, spots! Spots!"
Roger, (as they all get out) There they are! 
Anita," (hugs some of them) Oh, this is wonderful! They're all here! "
Roger," Oh, come now! Oh, stop it! Stop it! "
Perdita," (as her children nuzzled her) We were so worried about you. Penny, Lucky! Oh, my darling puppies! "
Perdita," Oh, Patch, you're safe! We were so worried about you. "
Pongo," We missed you very much, Patch. "
Patch, You did? 
Pongo," Of course, son. "
Patch," Mum, Dad, this is Thunderbolt. He saved us. "
Pongo, I don't know how to thank you for saving my family. 
Thunderbolt," No, no, don't thank me. It was your son, Patch, who... "
Jewel," Mum, Dad, the devil woman got us! And we were trapped, and then Patch got us out! "
Rolly," Yeah, and Patch made me a trampoline! "
Lucky," You should have seen Patch, mother. He was fantastic! Just like Thunderbolt. "
Thunderbolt," You know, they're right, kid. Me, I'm just an actor. But you...you are a real, (pushes him with his nose) one-of-a-kind wonder dog."
Reporter," (to the other press members) Hey, lads, they're over here! "
Patch, Whoo! 
Reporter," (to the dog family) Say ""spots""! "
Dirty Dawson," Ya-ohhh! Ahhh-ah-ah-ah! Oh, now, come on! Down, boy! Down, all of y'all! This ain't fair!"

CROSS DISSOLVE TO, 
PHLEGMENKOF," I got you a job in the Fish Factory. You go straight down this path till you get to the fork in the road, go left - are you listening?"
ANYA," Bye, bye everybody, I’m listening Comrade Phlegmenkof."
PHLEGMENKOF, You’ve been a thorn in my side since you were brought here.
ANYA, He-hey.
PHLEGMENKOF, Acting like the Queen of Sheba …
PHLEGMENKOF, … instead of the nameless no account you are.
PHLEGMENKOF," And for the last ten years I’ve fed you, I’ve clothed you. I’ve kept a roof over your head"
ANYA, (interrupts) Kept a roof over my head. Oh!
PHLEGMENKOF, How is it you don’t have a clue as to who you were before you came to us but you can remember all that?
PHLEGMENKOF, (interrupts) Ugh! I know! (pulls at the necklace)
PHLEGMENKOF," ‘Together in Paris. So, you want to go to France to find your family, huh? … (Laughs)"
PHLEGMENKOF," … in life and in line, and be grateful too."
PHLEGMENKOF," Together in Paris. (LAUGHS, COUGHS) Be grateful."

ANYA, My name is Anya … I need travel papers… (whispered) They say you’re the man to see even though I can’t tell you who said that.
DIMITRI," hmm, hmmm"
DIMITRI, I’m sor…I’m sorry Enya.
ANYA," It’s Anya, Anya"
DIMITRI," Anya, it’s just … just that you look an awful lot like … Never mind … Now, you said something about travel papers?"

DIMITRI, You’d like to go to Paris?
ANYA, Mhmm.
DIMITRI, Nice Dog
VLADIMIR," Oh, oh, it’s marvelous. AW! I love, I love, I love you."
DIMITRI," Let me ask you something, Anya was it … Is there a last name that goes with that?"
ANYA," Well, actually … This is going to sound crazy … I don’t know my last name. I was found wondering around when I was 8 years old."
DIMITRI, And before that … before you were eight?
ANYA," Look, oh look, I know it’s strange but I don’t remember. I have very few memories of my past."
DIMITRI," (whispers to Vlad) Hmm, that’s, that’s perfect."

DIMITRI, Paris.

DIMITRI," (whispers to Vlad) Hey, Vlad, Vlad tickets! (to Anya)Ah sure would like to … in fact, oddly enough, we’re going to Paris ourselves."
ANYA, oh I
ANYA, Oh.
VLADIMIR, We are going to reunite the Grand Duchess Anastasia with her grandmother.
VLADIMIR, The same blue eyes.
DIMITRI, The Romanov eyes.
VLADIMIR, Nicholas’ smile.
DIMITRI, Alexandra’s chin.
VLADIMIR," Oh, look she even has the grandmother’s hands!"
DIMITRI," She’s the same age, the same physical type."
ANYA, Are you trying to tell me that you think that I am Anastasia?
DIMITRI, All I’m trying to tell you is that I’ve seen thousands of girls all over the country and not one of them looks as much like the Grand Duchess as you do. I mean look at the portrait.
DIMITRI, Why? You don’t remember what happened to you…
VLAD, No one knows what happened to her.
DIMITRI, You’re looking for family in Paris.
VLAD, And her only family is in Paris.
DIMITRI, Ever thought about the possibility?
ANYA, That I could be royalty?
 DIMITRI, MmmHmm
ANYA," Well I don’t know … it’s kind of hard to think of yourself as a Duchess when you’re sleeping on a damp floor. But sure, yeah, I guess every lonely girl would hope she’s a Princess."
VLADIMIR," And somewhere … One little girl is. After all, the name Anastasia means ""she will rise again""."
DIMITRI," Really wish we could help, but the third ticket is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia."
ANYA, Sigh!
DIMITRI, Good luck.
VLADIMIR, Why didn’t you tell her about our brilliant plan?
DIMITRI, All she wants to do is go to Paris. Why give away a third of the reward money.

VLADIMIR," Ha, right in the palm of our hand."
ANYA," (shouts) Dimitri, wait!"
ANYA," if I don’t remember who I am, then who’s to say I’m not a princess or a duchess or a whatever she is … Right?"
DIMITRI, Hmm … Go on.
ANYA," Yeah, and if I’m not Anastasia, the Empress will certainly know right away … and it’s all just an honest mistake."
DIMITRI, Sounds plausible.
VLADIMIR," But if you are the princess, then you’ll finally know who you are and have your family back."
DIMITRI," (both laughing): You know, you know he’s right! Either way, it gets you to Paris."
ANYA, Right!
DIMITRI, OW!

DIMITRI, I’m allergic to dogs.

BARTOK, Aah … YAAAAGH!!!
BARTOK," Oh, come on now. Am I supposed to believe that thing woke up after all these years just because some guy claims she’s a Romanov?"
BARTOK, (spooked) Okay! Okay! I get-the message! Enough already with glowing and the smoke people!
BARTOK, (amazed) If that things come back to life it must mean Anastasia’s alive.
DIMITRI, Just leave the dog.

DIMITRI, Miss what … your talking?
ANYA, Russia.
DIMITRI, Nope.
ANYA, But it was your home.
DIMITRI, It was a place I once lived. End of story.
ANYA, Well then you must plan on making Paris your true home.
DIMITRI, What is it with you and homes?
ANYA," Well, for one thing it’s something that every normal person wants, and for another thing, it’s a thing where you …"
DIMITRI, (interupting) What?
DIMITRI, Fine.
ANYA, AAAH!
ANYA, Gasp! Thank goodness it’s you. Just please remove him from my sight.
VLADIMIR, What have you done to her?
MITRI, (shuttering) Me? It’s her!
ANYA, Ha! Just trying to have a simple conversation.
VLADIMIR, Oh no … an unspoken atttaction!
DIMITRI, Attraction? To that skinny little brat … have you lost your mind?
VLADIMIR, I was only asking a simple question.
DIMITRI, Attraction Ridiculous!

TRAVELING MAN," Last month, the traveling papers were blue, but now they’re red."

DIMITRI," You don’t know it’s a lie. What if it’s true? OK, so there’s one more stop on the road to finding out who you are. I just thought this was something you had to see through to the end no matter what."
ANYA," (sighs) But look at me, Dimitri! I am not exactly Grand Duchess material here, Aah."
VLADIMIR," Tell me, child, what do you see?"
ANYA," I see a skinny little nobody, with no past and no future."
VLADIMIR," I see a engaging and fiery young woman … who on a number of occasions has shown a regal command equal to any royal in the world. And I have known my share of royalty. You see my dear, I was a member of the imperial Court."

RASPUTIN," (imitating, mocking) ""Rasputin!"" Destroyed by your despicable family! But what goes around comes around!"
ANYA," Stop no, get away. No, no…"
BARTOK," You’re on your own, Sir. This can only end in tears."
ANYA, I’m not afraid of you.
RASPUTIN, I can fix that! Care for a little swim under the ice?
ANYA, Dimitri! If we live through this remind me to thank you.
DIMITRI, You can thank me later.
RASPUTIN," How enchanting, ""together again"", for the last TIME!"
ANYA, Noo…
DIMITRI, Wow!
ANYA, Dimitri!
RASPUTIN, Taha!
DIMITRI," Anya, Watch Out!"
RASPUTIN," Dasvidanya, your Highness."
DIMITRI, Hold on!
RASPUTIN," Finally, the last Romanov death!"
RASPUTIN," Ya, ha, ha!"
DIMITRI, No! ANYA!
RASPUTIN, Long live the Romanovs!
ANYA," Right, I couldn’t have said it better myself!"
RASPUTIN, AAAAGGGHHH!
ANYA, This is for Dimitri… Ah…
RASPUTIN, Give it back!
ANYA, This is for my family!
RASPUTIN, I’ll tear you to pieces!!
ANYA," And this, this is for you!"
RASPUTIN, No!
 She gives the boat one last look," happy and sad, then turns to go."
FADE OUT, THE END
Numero uno, Don't tell anyone about us.
someone to love, An angel.
Hank, [voiceover] I still think about the night your mother and I had to leave you...
Janet," [to the woman, faintly] Hopefully, it's not for long, but I'll call you when we get settled.When I have a better indication of what's going on."
Young Hope, Mommy?
Janet," Oh, Jellybean. [She kneels down to meet eye-level with Hope.] Daddy and I have a last minute business trip, so Rose is going to stay with you for a few days."
Young Hope, No. I don't want you to go.
Janet, Ugh! It's gonna be so boring! I won't be able to keep my... eyes...
Hank," Goodbye, sweetheart. Alright, we'll see you soon. [He kisses Hope on the forehead. He then touches Janet's shoulder.]"
Hank," [voiceover] I wish we could have put down our bags, and tucked you back into your bed, but too many lives were at stake."
Hank, Oh my god! They've already launched!
Janet, We have to stop it! Come on!
Hank," [voiceover] The only way to disarm the missile was to get inside it, but the plating was too thick. The only way in was to shrink between the molecules."
Janet, I can't get through! Hank...
Hank," [voiceover] We both knew that if you go that small, there's no coming back."
Hank," [voiceover] It should have been me, but my regulator was damaged. Your mother's wasn't."
Janet, Tell Hope I love her...
Hank, [voiceover] She turned it off.
Hank," Janet, no!  "
Hank, [voiceover} And went subatomic to deactivate the bomb.
Hank," [voiceover] Your mother saved thousands of lives that day, knowing she'd be lost in the quantum realm. Alone. Afraid. Gone forever."
Hank," [voiceover] Telling you that she wasn't coming home, was the hardest thing that I ever had to do."
Hank," But then Scott showed up. Or should I say, broke into our house. And when he went to the quantum realm... and came back. Everything changed. I started to wonder... could your mother still be alive? So, I dusted off some old plans."
Hope," Dad, what are you saying?"
Hank, I think it's possible to bring her back.
Scott," Okay. We're in. Oh, this place is a maze. Where's that map? We're definitely close. You ready?"
Cassandra," I'm ready, Daddy."
Scott," Are you sure? 'Cause once we're inside, you show any hesitation or fear, we're done."
Cassandra, I eat fear for breakfast.
Scott," Wow. That is super cool. Come on. Look! It's Anton. He'll show us the way. Anton, which way do we go? Anton, which way do we go? Thanks, Anton! Look, the ants have burrowed into the tech facility."
Cassandra," Oh no, lasers!"
Scott, Oh! I think I got lased! The secret vault. Tell me you brought the contact lens.
Cassandra, Yup.
Scott, Perfect! Right there.
Cassandra, There! It's the micro-treasure!
Scott, My trophy?
Cassandra, It looks like treasure.
Scott," Oh, it is to me."
Cassandra, I want to take it to show-and-tell.
Scott," Oh, no, you can't do that. You can't. It never leaves the house. It's too important. This is the best birthday present you ever got me. I'm so touched you think I'm the world's greatest grandma."
Cassandra, It was the only one they had.
Scott, It makes me want to knit you a sweater.
Cassandra," Oh, no, the fuzz!"
Luis," Hey, Scotty... I was looking at the schematics for the Karapetyan buildings... and I think we have way too many security cameras, don't we?"
Scott," No, no, not at all."
Luis," I mean, 'cause it's a lot of security cameras."
Scott, I know what he needs. Who's the security expert in our business?
Luis," You are, but I'm running the company, right? And if we overquote him... he's gonna go somewhere else. I mean, we gotta land this bird."
Scott," He ain't goin' anywhere. And the expression is ""land this fish."""
Luis," No, it's ""land the bird."" Just like you land the plane. You gotta land the plane to be in business."
Scott," I know it's silly to get hung up on these kinds of things, but I do."
Luis," How am I gonna land a fish? It can't walk. And if it swam up on shore... and it battled a hawk, who's gonna win?"
Scott," You've really turned me around on this thing. It's okay. We're gonna land Karapetyan. Now, if you just excuse me... I'm in the middle of trying to steal something with my daughter."
Luis, I'm gonna go recheck it.
Cassandra, To the escape ant! Let's bounce before the po-po come back!
Luis," The po-po? How do you even know that? Let's fly, Antoinette! Let's fly! Crash landing!"
Cassandra, Whoo! I wish we could shrink for real.
Scott, Oh. That is pretty cool.
Luis," Hey, I'm headed to the office, Scotty. And sorry about freaking out earlier, you know. But I feel like I'm way better. My heart is definitely beating way too hard and stuff. And my hands are shaking. But I think it's unrelated, you know?"
Scott," It's gonna be great, Luis! You got nothing to worry about!"
Luis," Yeah, yeah. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
Cassandra," Daddy! Come on, Woo! I've got three days left. Why would I try to escape?"
Woo," Sorry, Scott, but rules are rules. You trip the perimeter alarm, we search the place. Keel to stern, soup to nuts."
Scott, Thank you. It was an accident. My foot went through the fence.
Cassandra, Our flying ant crashed.
Scott," Hey, you try and entertain a 10-year-old when you can't leave the house. You know the lengths that I've gone to? Close-up magic. I learned that."
Cassandra, Why can't you just leave my daddy alone?
Woo," Oh, Cassie. This must all seem like a bunch of confusing grown-up stuff to you, huh? Well, think of it this way. Your school has rules, right? Like, you can't draw on the walls. Well, your daddy went to Germany and drew on the walls with Captain America. And that was a violation of Article 16, Paragraph Three of the Sokovia Accords. Now, as a part of his joint plea deal... with Homeland Security and the German government... he was allowed to return to the U.S... provided he serve two years under house arrest... followed by three years of probation. And avoid any unauthorized activities, technology... or contact with any former associates who were... or currently are in violation of said Accords. Or any related statutes. Okay, sweetie?"
Scott, Wow. You're really great with kids.
Woo," Thanks. I'm also a youth pastor. Anyway, not to be a Johnny ask-a-lot... but you haven't had any contact with Hank Pym or Hope Van Dyne, have you?"
Scott, No.
Woo," You sure? Because it's only a matter of time before we get 'em. It was their tech, so they violated the Accords, too. And associating with them breaks your deal. And, uh, I don't need to remind you... that any violation of your agreement means 20 years in prison. Minimum."
Scott, I haven't talked to Hank or Hope in forever.
Cassandra, They hate his guts.
Scott," Thanks, peanut."
Woo," How'd you do it, Scott?"
Scot, Do what?
Woo, The card trick.
Scott, Seriously?
Maggie," Oh, my God! You people can't just show up here whenever you want and search the place."
Paxton," Actually, they can."
Maggie, You need a warrant.
Paxton," Actually, they don't."
Maggie, Really? Wow. Did you pack your soccer shoes?
Cassandra, Yeah.
Maggie, All right. Next time I see you will be on the outside.
Paxton," All right. Oh, get on the inside of this. Hey, three days. Seriously... I'm proud of you, bud."
Scott, Thank you.
Paxton, You know what? Give me another one.
Maggie, Me too! Gosh! Freedom! New business! I am sensing greatness.
Cassandra," I had a fun weekend, Daddy."
Scott," Me too, peanut. But just wait till next weekend. Once I'm outta here, you and I are gonna go paint this town red. We'll have so much ice cream, we'll never stop puking."
Maggie, You're gettin' good at that.
Paxton, How'd you do that?
Cassandra," Bye, Daddy."
Maggie, Bye.
Scott, Bye.
Cassandra, Bye.
Scott, Three days. Easy-peasy. We had a dream ♪ We'd go travelin' together ♪ We'd spread a little lovin' then we'd keep movin' on ♪ Easy-peasy.
Cassandra, Where are you?
Hank, Everything that you know... Lost... in the quantum realm.
Scott, What?
Janet," I'm gonna find you, Jellybean. I found you!"
Hope," You always find me, Mommy."
Scott," What the hell? Hey, Hank! It's been a while. Um, I don't even know if this is your number anymore. And I'm probably the last person you wanna hear from. But I just had a really weird dream. And I know that doesn't sound like an emergency or anything... but it just felt very real. I was back in the quantum realm... and I think I saw your wife. And then I was your wife. I mean, not in a weird way or anything. You know, hearing this out loud, I'm thinking, uh, it's not an emergency. I'm sorry to bother you. I'm sorry for a lot of things."
TV," That means, one tiny atom in my fingernail could be... Could be one, little, tiny universe."
Scott, Hope? Is this another dream?
Hope, Do you think it was a dream... or is it possible that you really saw my mom down there?
Scott, I'm not sure. I can't be here! I can't be here! I'm under house arrest!
Hope," They won't open while the system's engaged, Scott."
Scott, You have to take me home. They could show up any second!
Hope," Relax. As far as your nanny cops know, you're still at home."
Luis, Whoa! Scotty?
Hope," He's programmed to replicate your daily routine. Nine hours in bed. Five hours in front of the TV. Two hours in the bathroom, whatever that's about."
Scott, That's totally inaccurate. And how do you know about my daily routine? Are you spying on me?
Hope," We keep tabs on all security threats, all right? And so far the biggest one we've had is you."
Scott," I'm sorry about Germany. They just showed up. They said it was a matter of national security. That Cap needed help, so..."
Hope, Cap?
Scott," Tain America. Captain. Cap. It's what we call him. If you're a friend. I'm not saying I'm a friend of... A little, I know him. He's nice. Whatever. I'm sorry! All right? I didn't think I'd get caught."
Hope, You didn't think about a lot of things.
Scott, How's Hank?
Hope," We're still running. The house is gone, so is our freedom. How do you think he is?"
Scott, I'm sorry. I know you're mad.
Hope," I'm not looking for an apology, Scott. The only reason why we're even talking is... because we need what's in your head."
Scott," Is this where you're living? If you need help or money or something, maybe I can..."
Hope, We're fine.
Scott," Hey, Hank. Look, I just wanna..."
Hank, Save it! Can we start?
Hope," Yeah. So, while you were relaxing at home... we were building this. It's a tunnel. To the quantum realm. To my mom. We think she might still be down there. We just don't know where."
Scott, What?
Hope, If we can pinpoint my mom's location... then the pod can take me down to get her.
Scott, You built all this and you don't even know if she's alive?
Hank," It's called a hypothesis. Last night, we powered up the tunnel for the first time. It was overloaded and it shut down. But for a split second, the doorway to the quantum realm was opened."
Scott, And?
Hope," And five minutes later, you called, talking about Mom."
Hank," We think when you were down there, you may have entangled with her."
Scott," Hank, I would never do that. I respect you too much."
Hank," Quantum entanglement, Scott."
Hope," We think she might have put some kind of a message in your head. Hopefully, a location. And opening the tunnel triggered it."
Scott, Your mom put a message in my head? Come on. That's insane.
Hank," No, Scott. Insane is going to Germany without telling us, and fighting the Avengers. Just tell me you weren't lying about the suit you took. Tell me you really destroyed it."
Scott," I did, I destroyed it, I swear."
Hank, I can't believe you destroyed my suit! That was my life's work!
Scott, What was I supposed to do?
Hank, You were supposed to not take my suit!
Scott," I'm sorry, Hank! I'm sorry I took the suit. I'm sorry that I called last night. I don't remember seeing Janet down there. I wish that I did. I just had a dream about her playing hide-and-seek with a little girl."
Hope, What?
Scott, I had a dream. She was playing hide-and-seek with a little girl. Cassie and I do it all the time. Doesn't mean anything.
Hope, But was it Cassie in the dream?
Scott, No.
Hope, Where was she hiding?
Scott, What?
Hope, The little girl. Where was she hiding? Was it in a wardrobe?
Scott," No, it was in a tall dresser."
Hank, You mean a wardrobe.
Scott, Is that what that's called?
Hope, What color was it?
Scott, Red.
Hope, Were there horses on it?
Scott," Oh, boy."
Hope, It's where I hid every time that we played.
Scott, It doesn't sound like you really got the gist of the game.
Hope, She's alive.
Hank, I knew it. I knew it!
Hope, We need to get that part.
Hank, Okay.
Hope, The sooner we get the tunnel working... the sooner we can get this message out of his head.
Hank, Does Burch have it?
Hope, Yeah. Let's go.
Scott, What part? Who's Burch? Wait. What's happening?
Hope, We need a component to stop the tunnel from overloading again. I grabbed your clothes. You might want to change.
Scott," Look, I'd really like to help you... but if I'm not at home when they come to take off my ankle monitor... then I'm going away forever."
Hope," Once we get the component and power up the tunnel... we'll get the message, and have you home by lunch. We have to hurry. The entanglement won't last."
Hank, You owe us.
Scott," All right, fine. But can I just wait inside? Because I'm not supposed to be out here."
Hank, Let's go.
Hope, We good?
Hank, Yeah.
Hope, I'll be right back.
Scott, Can I have one of these?
Hank, No.
Sonny Burch, Ah. Susan! Welcome to Oui!
Hope, Sonny!
Sonny Burch," Oui is French for ""yes."" As in ""yes"" to farm-to-table, ""yes"" to locally sourced... and ""yes"" to planet before profit."
Hope," Well, let's hope it also means ""yes"" to ""Do you have the component I ordered?"""
Sonny Burch," You know, I have always loved your sense of humor, Susan. Have a seat."
Hope," No, I'm good. Thank you."
Scott, Who is this guy?
Hank, Sonny Burch. He traffics in black market technology. He's been getting us what we need to build the tunnel.
Scott, Could I just have one...
Hank, No.
Sonny Burch," You know, I have a special friend at the FBI. And I say ""special""... because, well, he tells me things that I didn't previously know. For example... your name isn't Susan. It's Hope Van Dyne. And your unseen associate, that's your father, Hank Pym."
Scott," That's not good, Hank."
Hank, No shit.
Hope, What do you want?
Sonny Burch," Relationships are built on trust, Hope. And I want our relationship to have a strong foundation."
Hope, Our relationship?
Sonny Burch," My business landscape has been shifting, Hope. Hell, S.H.I.E.L.D. and HYDRA don't even exist anymore... but now, Hank Pym... Hank Pym is a real opportunity."
Hope, Do you have a point?
Sonny Burch," Oh, you think that I don't know what you've been building with all this? Quantum technology. Now, you can forget nanotech, forget AI, forget cryptocurrency. Quantum energy is the future. It's the next gold rush."
Hope, Is that so?
Sonny Burch," I want in, Hope. So, as a gesture of good will, I have taken the liberty... of arranging some buyers for your lab. Starting bid... one billion dollars."
Hope," Thank you, Sonny, really. But my father and I have something slightly more pressing than starting a business. So I'll just take the component as arranged."
Sonny Burch," My buyers don't take no for an answer. So, we are either in business together... or we aren't in business together."
Hope, Then I guess we aren't.
Sonny Burch, You can go. But I'm afraid your money's gonna have to remain. Let's call it compensation for my injured feelings.
Hope," Listen, Sonny. This is gonna be so much easier on everybody if you just give me that component."
Sonny Burch," Darlin', the only thing you're takin' from here... is my heart, but it will mend in time."
Hope, Okay.
Scott," So, now what?"
Hank, You'll see.
Sonny Burch, She said her and her daddy had something pressing.
Uzman, Mmm-hmm.
Sonny Burch, I want to know what it is because if they're not working with us... they're working with somebody. So find out. I want some names...
Scott," Hold on, you gave her wings?"
Sonny Burch, Get her.
Sonny Burch," Not my turn-of-the-century chandelier! Stop firing! Stop! All right, take this. Go. Go, go, go! Go!"
Scott, Wings and blasters. So I take it you didn't have that tech available for me.
Hank," No, I did."
Hope," It was a pleasure doing business with you, Sonny."
Sonny Burch," Oh, our business isn't finished yet, Hope. I can assure you of that! What in the hell is that?"
Hope," Dad, are you seeing this?"
Hank," Hope, get out of there!"
Scott, I gotta do something.
Hank, Wait! It is still a work in progress.
Scott, You taught me that kick. Remember?
Hope," Yeah, great form."
Scott, Those were the days. Whatever happened to us?
Hope," Not the time, Scott. Damn it, where'd it go? I've lost it."
Scott, I'm not seeing anything on the ant cams. Try looking...
Hope, Dad?
Ghost, Give me that. Now.
Hope, Are you okay?
Hank, No! He got the lab.
Hope, No.
Hank, Come on!
Hope, What was that?
Hank, I don't know. But we need to find somewhere to regroup and figure out where the lab is.
Scott," So, where to now? How about my house? Hmm? I'm supposed to be there anyway, and Woo could walk in any second."
Hank, Exactly why we're not going to your house.
Scott," What about your house? Sorry. Well, there is one place I can think of."
Hank," No. No, no, no, no! No!"
Luis," Wow, Dr. Pym... who would've thought that, once again, in your hour of need... that you would turn to us, you know?"
Hank, Not me.
Kurt, Mmm. Help yourself.
Luis," Hey, what's up with the fancy pastry? We gotta keep the food budget down."
Dave," Well, what are we supposed to have for breakfast?"
Luis, The oatmeal packets.
Dave, Oatmeal packets.
Kurt, It's insult.
Luis, Why is it an insult?
Kurt, Because it tastes like sand.
Luis, You know why? 'Cause it's organic.
Kurt," It's not organic, it's sand."
Dave, It's the most important meal of the day.
Luis," You know what, you can get creative with it."
Kurt, Break teeth.
Luis, Put a little brown sugar on it. You can put some cinnamon. Put a little honey. Whatever you want...
Scott," Guys, guys, guys. Come on, man. We got bigger fish to fry. Is that my desk?"
Luis, Yeah.
Scott, What? Why do I have such a small desk?
Luis, Because you weren't there when we were choosing desks.
Kurt," You snooze, you lose."
Scott," Well, I was under house arrest."
Luis, Yeah.
Scott," You know what, this isn't even a desk. This is garbage. You found this outside amongst garbage."
Luis, I got it at a rummage sale.
Scott," So, you save money on my desk?"
Hope, Guys.
Scott," Hope, please, we need to focus, all right? We gotta find that lab already. Jeez."
Luis," Oh, you know what? I heard stories, like what happened to you. This crazy, creepy cat, who walks through walls and stuff. Like a ghost."
Kurt," Like Baba Yaga. Baba Yaga, the witch. They tell stories to children to frighten them. You know Baba Yaga?"
Hope, Whoever stole it... we need to find it.
Dave," Oh, you don't find someone like that. They find you."
Kurt, Like Baba Yaga.
Luis," Dr. Pym, you're the smartest genius I know. Didn't you put some kind of LoJack on your lab? Because if you didn't, we have a variety of affordable options."
Hank," Of course I did, Luis. It was disabled. Whoever stole the lab knew exactly what they were doing."
Hope, They also looked like they were phasing.
Scott, Phasing?
Hank, Quantum phasing. When an object moves through different states of matter.
Scott," Oh, yeah, that's what I was thinking."
Hope, The lab emits radiation. Can we modify a quantum spectrometer and track it?
Hank," That could work, yes, but all my equipment is in the lab."
Scott, Where else can we find that equipment?
Hank," Well, there is one person. Bill Foster."
Scott, Great! Who's Bill Foster?
Hope," He's an old colleague of my dad's, from S.H.I.E.L.D. They had a falling out years ago."
Luis, You seem to have a lot of falling outs with people.
Hank, It's probably just a waste of time.
Scott," Hey, I'm risking everything by being here. Don't you think we should check?"
Hope, We need to find out who took the lab.
Scott," Guys, it's not a good idea to be out in the open like this."
Hank," Relax, no one's gonna recognize us."
Scott," What, because of hats and sunglasses? That's not a disguise, Hank. We look like ourselves at a baseball game."
Bill Foster," In an isolated system... particles co-exist in a stable phase relationship. If the system is interfered with, that stability becomes chaos. Unpredictable. Dangerous. Beautiful. Isolated completely, a quantum system would revert back to separate states of matter... each entangled with a distinct state of its environment. In other words, the object in question would be both in and out of phase... with multiple parallel realities. Speaking of being out of phase with reality. I am noticing an unusually high number of glazed eyes out there among you. So, why don't we call it a few minutes early? That'll be enough for today. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, you may go. It's incredible. You're linked to Janet. It's quantum entanglement between the quantum states of Posner molecules in your brains."
Scott," Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Do you guys just put the word ""quantum"" in front of everything?"
Hope," Doctor, we need to find our lab. Hope, I'd love to help you... but I don't have anything like the equipment you're describing."
Hank," I told you this is a waste of time. Come on, let's go."
Bill Foster," Don't condescend, Hank. You're the one who's on the run from the FBI. All because you had to grow to a size that finally fit your ego."
Scott, That wasn't me in Germany. It was this idiot. Really?
Bill Foster," Going that big, it must've been exhausting."
Scott, I slept for three days straight. You have no idea.
Bill Foster," Actually, I do. Back in the day, I was Hank's partner on a project called Goliath."
Hank, Excuse me? You were my partner? The only thing more tiring than going that big is putting up with Hank's bullshit.
Scott, Right... I don't know. How big did you get?
Bill Foster, My record? 21 feet.
Scott, Not bad.
Bill Foster, You?
Scott, I don't...
Bill Foster," No, really, I'm curious."
Scott, 65 feet. Yeah.
Bill Foster, Whoa! Huge.
Scott, 65.
Hope, If you two are finished comparing sizes... we need to figure out a way to track down the lab.
Bill Foster, And the great Hank Pym hasn't figured that one out yet? Strange. You had all the answers back in the day. That's why I left the project.
Hank, Left? I fired you.
Bill Foster," Best decision I ever made. Hank was a terrible partner. Temperamental... stubborn, impatient. Sooner or later, he just pushed everyone away."
Hank, Just the mediocrities.
Bill Foster, Janet was the only one who could endure him and chose to stick it out.
Hank," Watch it, Bill."
Bill Foster," She paid the price, though, didn't she?"
Hank, You son of a bitch.
Hope, I didn't come here to listen to you two squabble. I'm trying to save my mother.
Woo," Now, which office would you say?"
Scott," Oh, it's Woo. Someone must have seen me."
Hank," Relax. If this is about you, they'd be in your house by now. What are you, 15?"
Hope, Come on. We gotta go right now.
Bill Foster, Wait. You might be able to improvise that tracker... if you modify the diffraction units on one of your regulators.
Hope, That could work.
Scott, I don't know what that means.
Hope, Thank you. Thank you.
Woo," But, Doctor, campus police says they ID'd both Pym and Van Dyne."
Bill Foster," I don't know what to tell you, Agent. I haven't talked to Hank in 30 years. I can assure you I'm the last person he would want to visit."
Agent," Oh, come on, you expect us to..."
Woo," Hey, hey. Why is that?"
Bill Foster, Simple. We hate each other's guts.
Hank," So I'm a terrible partner? Foster, he hasn't had one good idea in his unremarkable career."
Hope," But his idea about the diffractors could work, right?"
Hank," Fine, one decent idea. Except, I eliminated the diffractors when I upgraded the suits."
Scott," So, if we had an old suit, we might be able to track down the lab?"
Hank," Yes, but we don't."
Scott, What if we did?
Hope, What do you mean?
Scott, I mean... life's funny.
Hope," Oh, my God. You didn't destroy the suit."
Hank, What?
Scott," Well, it was your life's work, Hank. I couldn't destroy that. Before I turned myself in, I shrunk it down and mailed it to Luis."
Hank, You sent my suit through the mail?
Scott," Hey, the postal service is very reliable. You know, they do tracking numbers now. Like UPS."
Hank, Where is it?
Scott," It's in a very safe place, all right? Don't worry."
Luis," What, the trophy? No, it's not here."
Scott, What do you mean it's not there? Where could it be?
Luis," I looked everywhere. It's not here. Hey, get away from the plant."
Scott, But I put it back after Cassie and I... Show-and-tell.
Luis," Scotty? No, stop!"
Scott," Well, the good news is I know where it is. Whenever you go back to school... isn't everything supposed to look so much smaller? This place seems huge. What is it?"
Hope, It's the new regulator.
Scott," Hank, what's going on with this suit? How much of a work in progress is this? Uh-oh. No, no, no."
Hope, Oh.
Scott," What are you, laughing? Please, could you just..."
Hope," Okay, okay."
Hank, What do you see? The sizing coils are malfunctioning. Just let me...
Scott, Ow!
Hope, Sorry.
Scott, It's all right.
Hope, Okay. All right. Try that.
Scott, Sorry. What? Awesome.
Hope, If only Cap could see you now.
Scott, Hilarious. What are we gonna do?
Teacher," Hey! Where's your hall pass? Hey, I'm talking to you. Hey! Hey. Eh..."
Hope, You can do it. You almost got it.
Scott," Oh, peanut."
Hope," Okay, let's go."
Hank," Hiya, champ, how was school today?"
Scott," All right, get your jokes out now. Can you fix the suit?"
Hope, So cranky.
Hank, You want a juice box and some string cheese?
Scott, Do you really have that?
Hank, Let's see if Foster was right. This has gotta be the lab.
Hope, Let's go get it.
Hank, Yeah.
Scott," This seems right. Look at us, teaming up twice in one day."
Hope," Makes you think, huh?"
Scott, About what?
Hope, Germany.
Scott, What do you mean?
Hope," We were working together, training together... and other stuffing together."
Scott," If I had asked you, would you have come?"
Hope, I guess we'll never know. But I do know one thing.
Scott, What?
Hope," If I had, you'd have never been caught."
Hank," Hey, Scott. You think you can stop daydreaming about my daughter long enough to get my lab?"
Scott," Yes, sir."
Hank," Thank you. Okay, you're transmitting."
Hope, What took you so long?
Scott," Sorry, I had to come up with a name for my ant. I'm thinking Ulysses S. Gr-Ant. You like it?"
Hope, Hilarious.
Hank, I'm not getting anything on the monitors. There's some kind of electronic disturbance. Be careful.
Scott," You know me, Hank. I'm always careful... Whoa!"
Hope, It's okay. It's just the suit.
Scott, How do you know?
Hope, Look.
Scott, That's Ghost?
Hope, What is she doing?
Scott, Do you think that suit is how she goes through walls and stuff?
Hope, Let's just get outta here before she wakes up.
Scott," Hope, look! There's the lab. Now, we're sure this is our shrunken building and not somebody else's, right?"
Hope," Just take it, Scott. Come on, we gotta be fast."
Scott, I'll get it.
Hope," Oh, shit..."
Scott, Hope. Hope! Hank. Guys.
Ghost, I don't think they can hear you. Hi. I'm Ava.
Scott," Scott. So, you don't need the suit... to go through things."
Ghost," No. It just helps me control it. And the pain, supposedly."
Scott," You're not gonna reach into my chest and crush my heart, are you?"
Ghost," You're funny. I'm not gonna hurt you, Scott, unless I have to. I need... what's in your head. Let's wake up the rest of the gang and get this over with, shall we? Get up! Come on!"
Hope, Dad? Don't ever touch him again.
Ghost," Now, now, Hope... I think I'm being rather gentle with your father, all things considered. "
Hank, What the hell are you talking about? 
Bill Foster, Another casualty of Hank Pym's ego. 
Hank, Bill. What have you done? 
Ghost," It's what you've done, Dr. Pym. "
Scott," You're with her? Oh, man. I thought you were cool. "
Hope, What the hell is going on here? 
Ghost," I doubt Hank has ever mentioned my father. Why would he? Elihas Starr. They were colleagues at S.H.I.E.L.D. Quantum research. Until my father dare disagree with the great Hank Pym. You had him fired. Oh, and discredited for good measure. My father tried to continue his research on his own. Desperate to restore his name, so he took risks. "
Father of Ghost," No, no, no! "
Ghost, Too many. Until something went wrong. He told us to run. 
Mother of Ghost," Elihas, what's happening? "
Father of Ghost, Just go. Go! 
Ghost, Daddy! Daddy! I could tell he was scared. Daddy! 
Mother of Ghost," Ava, no! "
Ghost," I didn't want him to be alone. No! No! When I woke up, my parents were dead. I wasn't so lucky. They call it ""molecular disequilibrium."" A rather dull name, I think. Doesn't quite do justice to what it means. Every cell in my body is torn apart... and stitched back together. Over and over. Every day. "
Bill Foster," I was still at S.H.I.E.L.D. when I got the call about a quantum anomaly in Argentina. Hello, Ava. My name's Bill. I was a friend of your father's. I brought you something. It's all right. Try again. That's it. "
Ghost," Dr. Foster did his best to keep me safe. But others at S.H.I.E.L.D. saw an opportunity in my affliction. They built me a containment suit, so I could control my phasing. And trained me to be a stealth operative. They weaponized me. I stole for them. Spied for them. k*lled for them. And in exchange for my soul... they were going to cure me. They lied. "
Bill Foster," When S.H.I.E.L.D. collapsed, I took Ava in. I built the chamber to slow her decay, but her condition was progressive. I didn't know how to cure it. She wanted to k*ll you, Hank, but I told her no... and that she should watch you instead. And sure enough, she discovered that you were building the tunnel. Then, she told me about Lang. And the message from Janet inside his head, that's when I... Christ's sake! "
Scott," That's me. I'm sorry. Look, can you tell me who's texting me? "
Bill Foster," ""Cassie, 911."" "
Scott, That's my daughter. I need to text her back. 
Bill Foster," No, that's not happening. "
Scott," What, it's 911. That means it's an emergency. "
Bill Foster," You're not making demands here, Lang. You're not appreciating the gravity of the... "
Scott," Okay, look, she's trying to video chat me now. Something might be wrong. Let me talk to her. Please. Cassie, are you okay? What's the emergency? "
Cassandra, I can't find my soccer shoes. 
Scott, What? 
Cassandra, I have a game tomorrow. 
Maggie," Hey, Scott, I know that they're there. Can you just walk the phone around the house? "
Scott," No, I can't do that right now. "
Maggie, Why not? 
Scott, Because I'm sick. 
Maggie," Hey, can you just maybe look around later then and call me back? Please? Thank you. "
Cassandra," Bye, Daddy! "
Scott," Bye, peanut! Feel better! "
Paxton," Feel better, buddy! "
Scott, I'm sorry. It said emergency. 
Hank," Ava, I want to help you. "
Bill Foster, She doesn't need your help. I know how to save her. 
Hank," Oh, really? How? "
Ghost, Janet. 
Bill Foster," For the last 30 years, she's been down there absorbing quantum energy. We can extract that energy. We can use it to repair Ava's molecular structure... "
Hank, Extract it? 
Bill Foster, Yes. 
Hank, Are you insane? That would rip Janet apart. 
Bill Foster," You don't know that. I'm gonna fire up your tunnel. When Janet's location pops into Lang's head, he's gonna give it to me... or I'm gonna turn him over to the FBI. "
Scott, What? 
Bill Foster, You are gonna stay here... just in case I need your help. 
Hank, Like hell I would help you! 
Ghost, You'll do whatever I say. 
Hank, You're gonna k*ll Janet! 
Ghost," I'd be more worried about yourself, Hank. "
Hank," g*dd*mn it, Bill! "
Hope, Dad? 
Bill Foster," Calm down, Hank. "
Hank, So help me God... The pills. 
Hope," It's his heart! He needs his pills. Please, Dr. Foster. They're in the tin. Please. He could die! Come on! "
Scott, Help him! 
Hope," Dad, just hang on, all right? Just keep breathing. Stay calm. "
Scott," Help him, man! Come on! "
Hope, The Altoid tin! 
Ghost, Wait! 
Scott," Thanks, guys. Hank! "
Hank," Bill is filling that girl's head with lies. Elihas Starr was a traitor. He stole my plans. Now, bring it down. All right, lock it in. No, no, no. The bolt is on the other side. Tighten that one down, then bring it down one notch. Good job. "
Hope, It'll work. 
Hank," Foster, he could have fried the entire system. "
Hope," Look, we'll adjust the relays while you go reprogram the settings, all right? It's going to be fine. "
Scott," So, this is it. "
Hope, Yeah. You'd think with all this time to prepare I'd be more ready. 
Scott," Oh, going subatomic isn't something you can prepare for. It kind of melts your mind. "
Hope, I mean seeing my mom again. 
Scott, Oh. 
Hope, What if she's a completely different person? 
Scott," Yeah, like, uh, George Washington. "
Hope," I'm serious, Scott. "
Scott, Or George Jefferson. 
Hope, What if she's forgotten about me? 
Scott, When I was in prison... the only thing that got me through was Cassie. I could have been locked up for 100 years... I never would have forgotten her. I know your mom is counting the minutes until she can see you again. 
Hope, Thank you. 
Scott, Hey. 
Luis, We got a big problem. You forgot the motion sensor lights on the back of the building. 
Scott," Oh, no. "
Luis," And they're on the proposal, and Karapetyan asked for them specifically. "
Scott," Uh, yeah, look, it's been a little crazy. Look, maybe I could stop by tomorrow, take a look at it. "
Luis," No. No, no, no, no. The meeting is first thing in the morning. You gotta come right now and fix it. "
Scott," I can't. I wish I could, but I can't leave. "
Luis," You know what, I'm coming to you. I'll just bring the plans. They're on the laptop. And you can fix them there. Just tell me where you are, okay? "
Scott, It's complicated. 
Luis, What do you mean it's complicated? 
Dave," As you can see, sir, this system is state of the art. "
Kurt," Security of tomorrow, today. "
Luis," Oh, that's so good! And I love the lean-in, bro. Keep practicin'. Hey, I just gotta drive up to Scotty's, so we can fix the plans. But don't worry, I'll be back in plenty of time. "
Dave, As you can see... 
Luis," Oh, oh, oh! Tell me you got the van washed for tomorrow morning. "
Dave," Down to the undercarriage, baby. "
Luis, You sprung for the undercarriage wash? 
Dave," Well, you said get the works. "
Luis," That's a scam, bro. We live in California, not Minnesota. "
Sonny Burch," He's right. The undercarriage wash, that's for cleaning off road salt... laid down in our more snow-laden sister states. "
Luis," Who are you, and why do you know so much about car wash protocol? "
Sonny Burch," Well, my name is Sonny Burch. And I do my research, Luis. To wit, I have learned from a friend of mine... at the FBI that you are a known associate of Scott Lang... a known associate of Hank Pym, who I've also learned... has a portable shrinking laboratory... filled with all kinds of juicy tech. And you're gonna tell me where it is. "
Luis," Well, I hate to break it to you, but I don't know what you're talking about. "
Sonny Burch," Well, I sense a resistance in you, Luis. And I have promised results to some dangerous people. So, I'm gonna introduce you to my good friend, Uzman. Now... Uzman is a master at extracting information from the unwilling... through psychoactive means. "
Luis," Oh, is that truth serum? "
Uzman, There's no such thing as truth serum. That's just nonsense from TV. 
Dave," Well, what is it then? "
Sonny Burch, It's a little concoction that he's been perfecting since his days with the S.I.S. It makes you suggestible and highly responsive. 
Luis," Well, dude, that's truth serum. "
Uzman," No, it's not. "
Kurt," No offensing, but they sound like truth serum to me. "
Luis, Right? 
Gang Member, It's not a truth serum. 
Luis," Okay. Hey, I believe you. "
Gang Member, It's not a truth serum. 
Kurt," I mean, if it walk like duck and talk like ducks... "
Dave, The truth serum. 
Luis," Well, I have a lot of allergies... so you might wanna think about that. "
Bill Foster, We've got to get that lab back. 
Ghost, What? 
Bill Foster, The chamber and the suit are barely helping anymore. 
Ghost, How long have I got? 
Bill Foster," A couple of weeks, maybe. "
Ghost," Well, then we'll make them bring the lab back. "
Bill Foster, How? 
Ghost," Lang. He has a daughter, right? "
Bill Foster, You can't mean that. Ava! I tolerate a lot of the things you do out there... but I won't be a part of anything like that. 
Ghost," You're not the one who's about to fade away into nothing, Bill. I am! You said you could fix me! You promised. "
Bill Foster, I know. I will. But not like that.  You lay one finger on that little girl... I won't help you. And we're done. 
Ghost, Fine. There are other options. 
Luis, You know what? You're right. This isn't truth serum. Because I don't feel anything. That was a lie. I do feel something. This is truth serum! 
Uzman, There's no such thing! 
Sonny Burch," Okay. Okay, okay. Now, I'm gonna make this real easy for you, Luis. "
Luis, Okay. 
Sonny Burch, Where is Scott Lang? 
Luis," Well, see, that's complicated. Because when I first met Scotty, he was in a bad place. And I'm not talkin' about cell block D. His wife had just filed for divorce, and I was, like... ""Damn, homie. She dumped you when you're on lockup?"" And he was, like, ""Yeah, I know. ""I thought I was gonna be with her forever... ""but now I'm all alone."" And I was, like, ""Damn, homie. You know what? ""You gotta chin up, because you'll find a new partner. ""But you know what? I'm Luis."" And he says, ""You know what? I'm Scotty, ""and we're gonna be best friends."" "
Sonny Burch," Okay, hold on, hold on. I like a good story as much as the next person... but what in the hell does this have to do with where Scott Lang is? "
Luis, I'm getting there. I'm getting there. 
Dave," You put a dime in him, you gotta let the whole song play out. "
Kurt, He like human jukebox. 
Luis," Oh, my abuelita had a jukebox in the restaurant! Yeah, only played Morrissey. And if anybody ever complained, she'd be like... You know, Chicanos, we call him ""Moz."" Then, ¡adios! What can I say? We relate to his melancholy ballads, you know? "
Sonny Burch, Lang! 
Luis," Right, right, right. So, anyway, Scotty gets out of jail, and he starts working for Hank. That's when he met Hope. And Hope's all, like... ""I want nothing to do with you. ""Look at my hairdo, I'm all business."" And then Scotty's, like, ""You know what, girl? My heart is all broken. ""And I'll probably never find love again, ""but damn if I want to kiss you!"" But then you fast forward and they're all into each other, right? And then Scotty's, like, ""You know what? I can't tell you this... ""but I'm gonna go trash an airport with Captain America."" And then she said, ""I can't believe you split like that! ""Smell you later, dummy."" So, Scotty goes on house arrest. And he won't admit it, but his heart is all, like... ""Damn! I thought Hope coulda been ""my new true partner, but I blew it!"" But fate brought 'em back together. And then Hope's heart is all... ""I'm worried that I can't trust him... ""and he's gonna screw up again, and ruin everything!"" And then my heart is all, like... ""That fancy raspberry filling represents the company's red ""and we're days away from going out of business. Oh!"" "
Kurt," ""Out of business""? "
Dave," ""Days away""? "
Luis," Damn truth serum! I was trying to protect you guys. I swear to God. I was trying to be a good boss, but we're broke! And the Karapetyan's our last hope. And if we don't show up, we're done! "
Kurt, That's terrible bossing! 
Dave," Damn, bro! "
Luis, That's on me! That's on me! 
Sonny Burch, Hey! Enough. I'm gonna ask you one more time. Where is Scott Lang? 
Luis," I've been trying to tell you, he's in a tricky spot, emotionally speaking. "
Sonny Burch," Emotionally speaking. Well, where is Scott Lang, literally speaking! "
Luis, Oh! The woods. 
Ghost, The woods? 
Kurt, Baba Yaga! 
Ghost," What do you mean, ""the woods""? "
Luis," The Muir Woods, the second fire road off the Panoramic Highway! "
Ghost, For God's sake! 
Kurt," ♪ Baba Yaga, come at night ♪ Little children, sleepy tight "
Sonny Burch, ♪ Damn it! If that freak gets Pym's tech... I'm never gonna see it. 
Uzman," So, what do we do now? "
Sonny Burch," It's easier to steal it from the Feds than from the boogeyman. Hey, it's me. How'd you like to get a promotion? I got the location on Pym, Van Dyne and Lang. But you gonna have to take 'em down now, because they ain't gonna be there for long. And when you do, you gonna get me that lab. "
Sonny Burch," Good news, gentlemen. Feds are gonna do the hard work for us. What are you lookin' at? Change my tires! "
Uzman, Right. 
Woo, Can you knock? 
Woo," Ooh, I love leads. "
Hope, System's in the green. 
Hank, Priming the coils. 
Hope, Full charge. As soon as the tunnel's open... let us know if you get anything that could be a part of her message. 
Scott," Yeah, yeah. I will. "
Hank," Okay, then. Here it goes. "
Hope, We did it! 
Hank, You got anything? 
Scott, Nothin'. 
Hank," Well, just give it a minute, because it could... "
Hope," No. No, no, no, no! What's happening? It's shutting down. Maybe our vectors are off. "
Hank," We've gone over them a million times, I know they're right! "
Hope, Then what else could it be? 
Hank, I don't know! 
Hope," Scott, what are you doing? "
Hank," Scott, get away from that! "
Hope," Scott, you can't... "
Janet," I'm sorry, I don't know how much time I have. I need to fix the algorithm. Trust me, after 30 years down here... I've thought about it a lot. "
Hank, Janet? 
Janet," Hi, honey. Jellybean. "
Hope, Mom? 
Janet, It's not the reunion I'd imagined. It's all so rushed. You two have done such great work. You just need a little... nudge. 
Hank," Janet, how is this possible? "
Hope, It wasn't a message you put in Scott's head. It was an antenna. 
Janet, Clever girl. I'm so proud of you. 
Hank," Honey, tell us where you are. Tell us how to find you. "
Janet," No, the probability fields are too complex. That's why I needed to talk to you. You have to follow my voice. "
Hank, Of course! 
Hope, Like tracing a call back to its source! 
Hank, I'm tracking your signal using subatomic frequencies... between point two and point nine. 
Janet, I'd narrow it to four and six. 
Hank, That's too tight. We could miss you. 
Janet, Look at us squabbling again. 
Hank," Fine. All right, between three and seven. "
Janet," Our first fight in decades, and it's over just like that. Bullseye. "
Hope, Source lock. 
Hank, It's you. 
Hope, We got it! 
Janet," You have to meet me at these exact coordinates. In the wasteland, beyond the quantum void. It's very dangerous, especially on the human mind, so be careful. Time and space work very differently down here. You have two hours. After that, the probability fields will shift... and it'll be another century before they align like this again. "
Hope, We'll find you. 
Janet," I know you will, Jellybean. "
Scott," Nope. Nothing. I got nothing. No sign of Janet. Perfect. How did we get up here? All right, first you're gonna see all kinds of lights... and it's gonna get really trippy... but then it's gonna turn black and silent. Really silent. "
Hope," Scott, I'll be fine. "
Scott, I'm just saying because I've been down there. 
Hope," Yeah, so you've mentioned. "
Scott," Um, sorry. I have to take this. Hey, man, you coming? "
Luis," No, I'm not, but you know what? Ghost is. And you know what? The Feds, they know where you are. "
Scott, What? 
Luis," I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Uh, they gave me some truth serum. And then all of a sudden I started talkin' all honestly. Like, I hate the way that you load the dishwasher. I hate it, I hate it. "
Scott, Uh... 
Luis, But you need to go home... because the Feds are probably going there now! And by the way... who puts the plates on the top rack? They don't go there! 
Scott, I feel like such a jerk. You're gonna be really mad. We gotta go now. 
Hope, What? 
Scott, Ghost knows where we are. So does the FBI. 
Hope, How? 
Scott, I told Luis where we are. 
Hope, You what?
Scott, I told him to come here so I could help him with the Karapetyan proposal. 
Hope," Oh, my God! "
Scott," Look, we need to land that account. Otherwise, we lose the business! Do you know hard it is for ex-cons to find work these days? "
Hank," Jesus, Scott! "
Hope, 90 seconds to close the aperture! 
Hank, You have to depolarize the coils first! 
Hope, I know! 
Scott," I'm really sorry... but the, um, FBI is coming to my place so... I have to go. Can I borrow the suit? "
Machine voice, Gyroscopic stabilizers. Powering on. 
Scott, I'm just gonna borrow the suit. I'll come back. Just tell me where you'll be. 
Hope, Don't bother. 
Scott, What? 
Hope," We'll come and get the suit from you, as soon as we've found my mom. "
Scott, Hope... 
Hope," Scott, just go! "
Maggie, Scott? 
Cassandra, Daddy? 
Paxton," It's us, buddy! "
Maggie, We're here for Cassie's shoes! 
Paxton, He must be resting. 
Maggie," Honey, why don't you go upstairs and look under your bed? "
Cassandra," Daddy, you upstairs? Daddy? "
Paxton, What the... 
Maggie, He really lives like a pig these days. 
Cassandra, Daddy? 
Woo, Spread out! Again? 
Maggie, You people have no shame! 
Woo," Yeah, I'm not buying it! "
Maggie," Cassie, let the man get by! "
Cassandra, But Daddy's super sick! 
Woo, I'll see about that! 
Cassandra, He says he doesn't want anyone else to get sick! 
Woo," I'll take my chances, sweetie. "
Cassandra," He barfed. Like, a lot. "
Woo," Young lady, I'm a federal agent. I've seen worse things than vomit. Like, ""a lot"" a lot? "
Cassandra, Yes! 
Woo," Forget it, move aside! "
Cassandra, No! 
Scott, Woo! What are you doing here? 
Woo, Scott. 
Scott," I'm sorry, I'm just really sick. "
Cassandra, I told you. 
Scott, Excuse me. Sometimes you gotta just get it out. You know? Sorry. 
Hank, I'll start the van. You get the lab. 
Maggie, This is harassment! 
Paxton," Actually, it's not. "
Maggie," What does the FBI even stand for... ""Forever Bothering Individuals""? "
Woo, His monitor check out? 
Scott, Of course it does. 
Woo, Damn it! Looks like I just got fed a bowl of malarkey. 
Woo," Seriously? Yes! Oh, I'm sorry, Scott. They're your friends. That's insensitive. I just really needed a win, you know? Anyway, I'll be back later for the official end of your sentence! Sorry for misjudging you, pal! You should feel great about yourself! "
Scott, Hey. Thanks for covering for me. 
Cassandra, Sure. So... how long have you been Ant-Man again? 
Scott, Not long. It just sort of happened. I'm sorry for lying to you... and I'm sorry for risking everything. 
Cassandra," Daddy, it's okay. "
Scott, It's not. I do some dumb things... and the people that I love the most pay the price. Mainly you. 
Cassandra, Trying to help people isn't dumb. 
Scott, I screw it up just about every time. 
Cassandra," So, maybe you just need someone watching your back... like a partner. "
Scott," Well, she's made it clear that's about the last thing she wants. "
Cassandra, Who? 
Scott," Hope. Wait, who did you think? "
Cassandra, Me.
Scott, You? 
Cassandra, Don't laugh. I'd be a great partner. 
Scott," Aw, peanut. Aw. You would be awesome. And if I let you... I would be a terrible dad. "
Cassandra, Fine. Then have Hope be your partner. She's smart. 
Scott, She reminds me of you. 
Cassandra, You gonna go help her? I think you should help her. 
Scott, I wish I could... but I don't know how I could help her without hurting you. 
Cassandra, You can do it. You can do anything. You are the world's greatest grandma. 
Hank, An hour? We don't have an hour. 
Hank," Oh, now, that's my girl. All right, what's our plan? "
Hope, To shrink that wall. 
Hank, It looks load-bearing. The ceiling could collapse. 
Hope, Then we run like hell. 
Hank," Now, I estimate 15-20 agents on the floor. "
Hope, Roughly five times that in the building at large. 
Hank, They're all heavily armed. 
Hope, Not great odds. 
Hank, You got any better ideas? 
Hope, Nope. And I'm not giving up on Mom. 
Hank, She'd be so proud of you. 
Hope, Okay. One... two... Scott? 
Scott, What're you two just standing around for? We gotta go find that lab. 
Hank, What about me? Perfect. 
Scott, Hurry up and get dressed. We don't have much time. 
Hope," Okay, now what? "
Hank, You're asking me? 
Scott, Get in! Hi. 
Hope, Hi. 
Hank," Uh, excuse me. Are we planning on leaving soon... or are you two gonna keep staring at each other... until they start sh**ting at us? "
Scott, Yeah. 
Uzman," Hey, Burch. "
Sonny Burch, Yeah. 
Uzman," Yeah, they're out. "
Sonny Burch, I'm on my way. 
Woo," How could this happen? I mean, what the dickens? "
Hank, Thank you. 
Scott," You're welcome. So, uh, how do we find the lab?"
Hank, After we lost it the first time... I put on a new tracker... of sorts. 
Scott, That'll work. 
Ghost, Is it ready or not? 
Bill Foster," We can begin the extraction process. Listen, Ava. This whole thing could be very dangerous. Maybe we should... "
Ghost," Maybe we should what? Wait? I've got days until I'm dead. We're doing this, Bill. Now. "
Hank, Energy readings show they have not used the tunnel yet. 
Hope," We don't have much time before Mom's location shifts, and we lose her. "
Scott," Yeah, and we have a lot to do before then. You know, my pep-pep always said, ""If you want to do something right, you make a list."" So, we should do that. One, we have to break into that lab. Two, we have to kick out Foster and Ghost. Three, we're gonna have to fight Ghost. That seems like it should be part of two. 2-A, all right? Let's call it 2-A. Fight Ghost. 2-A. Oh, also, we have to make sure that the lab is fully grown for you to come back. Otherwise, we're screwed. "
Hank, Scott! 
Scott, You want me to start again? I'll start again... 
Hank," I'm going to dive. The only chance we got is if the two of you are out here... together, protecting the tunnel. Let me do this, Hope. Please. Let me get her. "
Scott, I think he's right. 
Luis," ""Whassup?"" You don't remember, uh, that beloved commercial? ""Whassup?"" "
Scott, I had him follow us. I thought we could use some help. All right. I'm in position. The ants are headed in. 
Hope, Copy that. 
Luis," Keep your eyes peeled, Scotty. Do you want Pez? "
Hope, No. 
Luis," Cassie gave me this for my birthday. By the way, I love that suit! "
Hope," Thanks, man. "
Luis," I wish I had a suit. I would even like a suit with minimal powers, you know? Or maybe even just a suit, with no powers. "
Ghost, What is it? 
Bill Foster, Don't know. It's them! 
Ghost, They can't be far. 
Bill Foster," All right, Hank. Hank? "
Hope," Dad, what's your status? "
Hank, Foster's taken care of. Suiting up now. 
Bill Foster, I just wanted to save Ava. She's facing death or something far more terrible. She's afraid. 
Hank," I'll help you find a cure when I get back. I promise. Together, we'll figure something out. "
Bill Foster," Good luck, Hank. "
Hank," Thanks, Bill. Now, I'm gonna need you to step back. "
Machine voice," Time remaining, 15 minutes. "
Hope," Hank's  in, Scott. Any sign of her? "
Scott," No, nothing yet. Ava! "
Ghost," Call off the ants, Scott. "
Scott," Oh, boy! Can I get a status report? 'Cause I got some serious Ghost problems here! "
Hank, Ready to dive. In case I don't make it... 
Hope," Don't. Don't say that. I can't lose you, too. "
Hank," I love you, Hope. "
Scott," Guys, everything's bad over here. "
Hope, Now. 
Scott, Misdirection. One of the first things they teach you at Online Close-up Magic University. 
Ghost, No! 
Luis," Plan worked. We got it, Scotty! "
Hope, Meet us at the rendezvous point. 
Scott," Okay, on my way! "
Hope," Oh, no. Really? This guy again? "
Scott, Who? 
Sonny Burch, I told you our business wasn't over. 
Hope, Change of plans. Hang on. 
Sonny Burch," I want that lab, boys, whatever it takes. Hold on. "
Luis, That undercarriage is filthy! 
Hope," Oh, they got bigger problems. "
Scott," Hope, what're you doing? You're heading away from the rendezvous point! "
Hope," Don't worry, I'm taking these guys on the scenic route. "
Scott," Wait, what're you... "
Luis," Oh. Oh, my God! Oh, my God! We're gonna die! We're gonna die! "
Machine voice, Signal lost. 
Hank, What the hell are they doing up there? 
Machine voice, Recalibrating. Recalibrating. 
Hank," You never said it was so beautiful, Scott. "
Machine voice, Recalibrating. 
Hank," Okay, any time now. "
Machine voice, Recalibrating. Recalibrating. 
Hank, Come on. 
Machine voice, Signal restored. 
Sonny Burch," Bikes, it's all you. "
Hope, Take the wheel. 
Scott, What? Wait! Whoa. 
Stan Lee," Well, the 60's were fun, but now I'm paying for it. "
Hope, Be careful up there! 
Scott," Hey, give me a break! I haven't driven in two years! "
Luis," Oh, you got pezed! "
Scott," Up here! Oh, that's not good. Hope! No! No! "
Sonny Burch," There it is, right there. Get the lab! Get the lab! "
Hope, I've got her. Westbound on Fremont. 
Scott, Hope! Wait! 
Luis," Hey, what about me? "
Scott," We got you now, Ava! Whoa! Oh! Not again! Piece of junk! "
Sonny Burch," Ah! Yes! Go, go, go, go, go! "
Hope, Burch got the lab. I'm going after him. 
Scott," No, no, no, no, no, no! Work in progress, my ass... "
Hope," Scott, where are you? I've got Burch in my sights. Hurry! "
Scott," I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming! "
Hope, We're running out of time. 
Machine voice," Warning, approaching quantum void. "
Hank," I'm coming to you, honey. "
Luis, Guys. Don't you need the remote to the lab? I just found it. 
Hope, We can't grow the lab without it. Get it to us fast. 
Luis," Yeah, but the van is busted. "
Scott, Use the Hot Wheels Rally case. 
Luis," What? I love you, Dr. Pym. "
Sonny Burch, The remote! We're missing the remote! You gotta check the van! 
Luis," Awesome! Hey, I'm going down Pacific. Burch's boys are all over me. "
Hope, I'm on my way. 
Scott, Right. I'll get the lab. 
Hope, Hi. 
Luis," Oh, that's badass! Nice. "
Scott," Doink! Come here, you little weasel! No, you don't! I guess maybe you do. Come on! Anyone see a Southern gentleman carrying a building? How'd he even have time to buy a ticket? Would you just one time, please work! Yes! All right, I need help. Yes! Oh. Sorry. Ah... Somebody! Hey! Come on, man! Not cool! Murderers! Yes, yes, yes, yes! I'm gonna call you Ant-onio Banderas! You're a badass! Yes! No, no, no! Ant-onio! "
Announcer," Our friends, the humpbacks, dip in here to the San Francisco Bay... for a little leisure and a little breeding. "
Sonny Burch," Listen, Uzman... "
Announcer," And perhaps they're down below as we speak, doing the nasty. "
Sonny Burch, Just meet me at the waterfront. In three hours. 
Announcer," Oh, folks. We've barely left the dock... but it looks like we got some company. Look. Right there. Do you see it, folks? There it is. There's a breach. What the...? "
Scott," Hi. Sorry. Hi. It's okay. It's okay! Sorry, I know I'm not a whale. This will just take a second. Hey! That doesn't belong to you! No, no! No, no! You're embarrassing yourself now Come on. Let go. Thank you. I'll take this now. "
Scott, It melts your mind. 
Hope, A message in your head. 
Scott, I had a dream. 
Hope, Daddy? Where's Mommy? It's where I hid every time that we played. 
Janet," I love you, Hank. "
Hope, Daddy? Daddy? Dad? What's going on? Why haven't you found Mom? 
Scott," You look lost, Hank. Are you all right? "
Bill Foster," Still think you have all the answers, Hank? "
Janet, It's me. 
Hank, I'm so sorry... it took so long. 
Janet, No. No. You're here now. Let's go home. 
Hank, I thought I was gone. But that energy from your hands... how did you do that? 
Janet," I'm not the same woman I was 30 years ago, Henry. This place... it changes you. Adaptation is part of it, but some of it is... evolution. "
Machine voice, Lab coordinates not found. Do not ascend. 
Hank, I should probably tell you what we're dealing with up there. 
Scott, I got the lab. I got the lab. Move. Move. Move! Get out of the way. 
Woo, Let's go. 
Scott, Get out of the way! I got the lab. The air feels chunky. 
Hope," Oh, no. He's too big. "
Luis, Scotty! 
Hope, Scott! 
Scott, I'm gonna go to sleep. I'm just gonna go to sleep now for five minutes. I just need five minutes. Five minutes! 
Luis, You get the lab somewhere safe. Scott's air won't last. 
Luis," Okay. Move! Move! Move! No, wait! "
Machine voice, Lab at full scale. 
Hank, They did it. 
Machine voice, Ready to ascend. 
Janet, Let's go see our daughter. 
Hope," Scott! Scott! Scott, come on, wake up! Come on. Come on, where are you, Scott? Gotcha. Scott? "
Scott, Hey. Hey. 
Luis," Hey, Scotty! Hope, come in. Did you get crushed by the building? "
Sonny Burch," Where's the remote, Luis? "
Luis, It's probably in there. I don't have it. I don't have it. 
Sonny Burch," I guess this is where we say... Adios, amigo. "
Luis," No, no, no, no! Thanks, guys. "
Bill Foster," Ava? Ava! Ava! Almost ready for extraction. Please, stop! People are getting hurt! "
Ghost, Everything hurts. Don't talk to me about pain! 
Bill Foster, What if Hank is right? What if this process kills Janet? 
Ghost," What, you're worried about her? "
Bill Foster, All I'm saying is that she is a brilliant scientist. She may be able to help. 
Ghost," Oh, she will help. Right now! And if she dies, she dies! "
Bill Foster," No, no. I'm sorry, we can't do this. We have to find another way. "
Ghost, This is the way. 
Hank, Janet! 
Hope, She started the extraction. She's gonna tear Mom apart. 
Ghost, No! 
Scott, Hope! Are you okay? 
Hope," Mom? Oh, my God. We found you. I missed you so much. "
Janet," I missed you too, Jellybean. It's okay. I'm here now. We have time. "
Hope," No more last-minute business trips, okay? "
Janet, I promise. 
Hank," No, it's okay! It's all right. Just don't worry about me. I'll be fine. "
Hope, Dad. 
Janet, Scott. 
Scott," Miss Van Dyne. It's nice to... Well, I guess we've already met. "
Janet, Yeah. I guess we have. Wait. Your pain. I can feel it. 
Ghost, It hurts. It always hurts. 
Janet, I'm sorry. I think I can help you. 
Scott, Did you know she could do that? 
Janet, It's okay. 
Luis," Guys, the cops are coming! Whoa. The cops are coming. Like, all of 'em! "
Scott, I gotta go. 
Hank, We gotta go! 
Hope, What about them? 
Kurt," No! We are going to our jobs. No. You see, we see these guys. They trying to sh**t people. "
Dave, So we apprehended them. For you. You're welcome. 
Uzman, We traffic in stolen technology. 
Uzman," Uh, he's in charge. "
Sonny Burch," That's true, I am. I've also committed numerous health code violations in my restaurant. Some of them would shock you. "
Uzman, It is truth serum. 
Hope, We gotta get outta here. Fast. 
Scott, I have an idea. 
Woo," Go, go! There he is! It's over, Scotty! I'm sorry, but we got you, man! Come on. It's the end of the line, pal. There's nowhere to hide. Just pull off that Band-Aid! You lost! It's okay! Damn it, Scotty, reduce yourself! Magic. Damn it! Get to Lang's, now! "
Janet," Well done, honey. "
Hank, Let's go! 
Ghost, Leave me here. 
Bill Foster, We can make it. 
Ghost, You said it yourself. I've hurt people. But you haven't. Go. Please! 
Bill Foster," We can make it, Ava. "
Ghost, Bill... 
Bill Foster, I'm not leaving you. 
Scott," Oh, hey, guys. Are my two years up already? What's it like out there? Huh? I mean, do people still dance? Are food trucks still a thing? "
Woo," Well, you got away with it this time, Scott... but, uh, I'll be seeing you again. "
Scott, Where? 
Woo, Huh? 
Scott, Where will you be seeing me again? 
Woo," Like, in general... The next time you do something bad, I'll be there to catch you... "
Scott, Oh. You'll be watching... I thought you were inviting me somewhere. 
Woo, Why would I do that? 
Scott," That's what I was wondering, why would you do that? "
Woo," Like a party, or like, dinner or something? "
Scott, I don't know. I thought you planned the evening. 
Woo," I meant, ""I'll arrest you, I'll arrest you later, again."" "
Scott," Of course, that would be strange. Take it easy, Jimmy. "
Woo," Okay. Did you want to grab dinner, or something? I mean, because I'm free... Yeah. Come on. "
Scott, You ready? 
Cassandra, Yeah! 
Maggie, Hi. 
Scott, Hi. 
Paxton, Hi. 
Dave," Oh! Yes, that was us. How can I help you? "
Luis," X-Con Security. Mr. Karapetyan? Yeah, you saw that? It would be an honor to be in business with you as well. I'll see you Thursday, 9 AM. Okay. "
Dave, Yeah! That's how you close a deal! 
Cassandra, This is awesome. 
Hope," So, Cassie... what do you want to be when you grow up? "
Cassandra, I wanna help people... like my dad. 
Hope, Really? 
Cassandra, I wanted to be his partner. But he said he wants you. 
Hope, Is that so? 
Cassandra, Daddy! 
Scott," Whoa! Hold on. Move, get outta here! "
Hope," Scott, don't, don't, don't! "
Scott," Ow. Oh, gross! Ugh. I hate that moth dust! Go! Shoo! Shoo!"
Hank," I used to be a respected scientist. I had my name on the sides of buildings. Now, I got this. "
Janet," Well, you wanted a smaller quantum tunnel. This is... smaller. "
Scott, Oh. Sorry. My bad. 
Janet," Ah, I think it has flair. "
Scott, All right. Control's online. 
Hope, The collection unit activates when you decouple it. It should automatically start absorbing quantum healing particles. 
Janet," Also, make sure you stay out of the tardigrade fields. They're cute, but they'll eat you. And don't get sucked into a time vortex. We won't be able to save you. "
Hope, Okay. Going subatomic in five... four... three... two... one. 
Hank," All right, Scott, this is a mic check. "
Scott," Mic check, one, two. One, two. How's everybody doing tonight in the quantum realm? "
Hank," Scott, we read you. I just wanna make sure. "
Scott, Okay. Healing particles secured for our new Ghost friend. 
Hope," Great. Preparing for re-entry in... five, four, three... "
Scott," Hello? Ha, ha. Very funny. Hank, quit screwing around. You told me yourself not to screw around. Hank? Hope? Janet. Guys. Guys. Okay, seriously, don't joke around. Bring me up, let's go. Guys!"

Scott Lang,"</b> You know, I promised your Mom that you would only use this stuff when one of us was around. It's really dangerous tech!"
Cassie Lang,</b> I know it's dangerous...
Scott,"</b> What if the cops took it from you, hm? What if you <i>lost</i> it?"
Cassie,</b> I didn't lose the suit!
Scott,</b> You have a suit? Wait-- You have a suit?!
Cassie,"</b> I know how to take care of myself, okay? Trust me, I'm pretty good at it by now!"
Scott,</b> ...ouch.
Cassie,"</b> Look, I didn't mean it like that, I'm sorry..."
Scott,"</b> I know, it's okay! It's alright -- I get it. I just think you should get to have a normal life!"
Cassie,</b> Dad. A guy dressed like a bee tried to kill me in my room when I was six. I've never had a normal life.
Hope Van Dyne,</b> How about some music?
Scott,"</b> <i>[on radio]</i> And in that moment, all I could think was ""How did the Hulk turn me into a baby? Will I be a baby forever? Am I the Hulk's baby?"""
Cassie,"</b> Dad, are you listening to your own book?"
Scott,</b> <i>[on radio]</i> But I was ready for anything. Steve and I grew close over that time...
Scott,"</b> Hm? No, that's, uh... That's just the radio."
Cassie,</b> <i>[giggling]</i> Dad! Turn it off!
Scott,"</b> It's so weird, something's wrong with this m-- switch, it won't turn off!"
Cassie,"</b> I said, turn it off!"
Scott,"</b> What's that, turn it up? Alright."
Scott,"</b> <i>[on radio]</i> A little after that, a little raccoon from space showed up. I don't think he knew my name. I was just happy to meet a raccoon who could talk."
Hank Pym,"</b> There are beings down here! Intelligent beings! I always theorized it was possible, but to <i>be</i> here... A subatomic universe...! This changes everything we know about life, evolution, our place in the galaxy-- Holy shit! That guy looks like broccoli!"
MODOK,"</b> Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott. I've been waiting a <i>long</i> time for this. "
Scott,</b> What...? Is someone in there?
MODOK,"</b> Oh, yes... A destiny you cannot escape. "
Kang,</b> You're an interesting man... Scott Lang.
Scott,"</b> Um, I don't know who you are, but you've made a big mistake, okay? I'm an Avenger. I've called the other Avengers."
Kang,</b> You're an Avenger? Have I killed you before?
Scott,</b> What?!
Kang,</b> They all blur together after a while. You're not the one with the hammer?
Scott,"</b> No, that's Thor. We get confused a lot, similar body types. Who are you?"
Kang,"</b> Just a man who's lost a lot of time, like you. But we can help each other with that."
Kang,</b> Find Lang's daughter. Kill her.
MODOK,"</b> It's over, Cassie."
Cassie,</b> Free the others! Go!
MODOK,"</b> Your dad's not here, Cassie. I guess that's not a big surprise."
Scott,</b> <i><b>KANG!</b></i> <i><b>WE HAVE A DEAL!</b></i> <i><b>You took my daughter!</b></i>
MODOK,</b> Holy shit. That's big...
Scott,"</b> <i><b>You lied to me!</b></i> <i><b>""Our word is our bond!""</b></i> <i><b>WITHOUT THAT WE'RE NOTHING!!!</b></i>"
Cassie,</b> Dad!
MODOK,</b> Nowhere left to run!
MODOK,"</b> You think this is over?! C'mon, let's go!"
Cassie,"</b> Darren, stop! Stop trying to be... whatever this is!"
MODOK,</b> It's too late. Look at me.
Cassie,</b> It's never too late to stop being a dick.
MODOK,</b> My name is Darren! <i><b>AND I AM NOT A DICK!!!</b></i>
Darren,"</b> You were right about me, Cassie."
Cassie,</b> Darren!
Scott,"</b> I don't know... what to say, thank you."
Darren,</b> You always were... a brother to me. And at least I died... An Avenger.

 NARRATOR," Here we are, floating peacefully in the sky. (2) Metro City, the jewel in the crown. (3) Beautiful, isn't it? But how did we get here? (4) A century ago, the founders of Metro City, seeing our world was changing, (5) took Mount Sofia and lifted it out of the Earth and into the sky (6) to be an oasis, a floating paradise. (7) We don't really know what happens these days (8) on the strange and mysterious Surface we left behind. (9) But life in Metro City is better than ever, thanks to our friends, the robots. (10) Robots do our shopping. (11) They cook for us. They serve our meals. (12) They take good care of us. (13) They even do the really important things (14) like reminding us to call Mom on her birthday. (15) Whether it's raising our children, building our buildings, (16) taking care of our city or making sure we're all fit and healthy, (17) for these guys, no job is too big (18) or too small. (19) Plus, robots do a lot of the things that frankly we just don't want to do anymore. (20) Oh, no! (21) NARRATOR: Don't worry, folks, that street will get clean. (22) The best and brightest of them get picked for the more exciting tasks. (23) This lucky guy is starting the first day at his new job. (24) [CRASH] (25) And it's all thanks to this man, Dr. Tenma, (26) head of the Ministry of Science and father of modern robotics. (27) Thanks to him and the incredible innovations he introduced... (28) Hey, Toby, isn't that your dad? (29) It sure is. Hush! (30) NARRATOR: Our friends, the robots, help us. Thousands are created every day, (31) and thousands are disposed of in the great unending cycle (32) that sustains life in our great city. (33) Thanks for everything, guys. May you rust in peace. (34) [LAUGHING] (35) Okay, students. Ready for a pop quiz? (36) What? SPORTY BOY: Oh, no. (37) Begin. (38) SPORTY BOY: Oh, man. I am so busted. (39) [ALL GRUMBLING] (40) Yes, Toby. Is there a problem? (41) There's no problem. I'm just finished, and I'd like to leave. (42) Finished? (43) For rocket science, it wasn't exactly rocket science. (44) I don't suppose there's much point in you staying. (45) Good luck, guys. GIRL: Jeez. (46) Just like his father. (47) Hello, Master Toby. Did you have a good day at... (48) Think fast, Orrin. (49) Thank you, Master Toby. Very good throw, by the way. (50) Hello, Son. Hello, sir. (51) How was school? Oh, great. (52) Moustachio dropped a pop quiz on us, but I'm pretty sure I got 100%. (53) That's good, Son, very good, but I don't want you to become complacent. (54) It's important to keep studying. Onward and upward, Toby. (55) Sure, Dad. (56) I'm aware I said I'd take you to that symposium on quantum mechanics, (57) but I'm afraid I have to take a rain check again. (58) But you promised. I'm sorry, Toby, but it's unavoidable. (59) President Stone has brought forward the unveiling of the Peacekeeper. (60) The Peacekeeper? You've got to be kidding me! (61) I never kid. Goodbye, Son. (62) The Peacekeeper, huh? (63) Hey, Orrin, change of plan. Take me to the Ministry of Science. (64) I'm sorry, Master Toby, but your father gave me strict instructions to... (65) Stop that! What are you doing back there? Hey! Hey! (66) Next stop, Ministry of Science. (67) [HORNS HONKING] (68) You ready to blow me away today, Tenma? (69) To make my hair stand up, to knock my socks off? (70) Yes, yes, metaphorically speaking. STONE: Well, that's the spirit. (71) Dr. Elefun is an esteemed colleague of mine, Mr. President. (72) He may be resistant to having his discovery used for military purposes. (73) Well, you leave Dr. Elefun to me. (74) TOBY: Dad! SOLDIER 1: Hold that kid! (75) What are you doing here? I gave Orrin specific instructions to... (76) [THUMPING] (77) Ow, ow. (78) I wanted to see the demonstration. You're always talking (79) about the Peacekeeper and... Really, Toby. (80) Your boy? Yes, sir. (81) Well, let him tag along. (82) Releasing potential threat. (83) It'll be good for him, educational. (84) Yes, sir. (85) So, you're interested in robots, son? Robot weapons? (86) Absolutely, though I'm sure you'll agree the latest D-Class Interceptor (87) underlying deployment-to-target system is quite old-fashioned. (88) [SIGHS] (89) Nobody likes a smarty-pants, kid. (90) Take this boy to a safe place and keep him there. (91) What the... (92) Dad! I think it's for the best, Toby. (93) But you said I could see the Peacekeeper. (94) You still can, on tonight's news with everybody else. (95) ELEFUN: Ladies and gentlemen, (96) allow me to present Blue Core energy. (97) Wow. ELEFUN: Blue Core energy, (98) a new self-sustaining power source (99) much stronger than nuclear energy and infinitely cleaner. (100) The raw materials came from space."
 STONE, I like that one.
 ELEFUN," As one friend to another, don't do this, Tenma."
 HECKLER, Activate weapon drones.
 DRONE, I hate this job.
 STONE, It's using that drone against the other drones. How's that possible?
 TENMA," It's called ""adaptive technology."" It can absorb and control anything."
 STONE," Well, I may have flunked out of college,"
 TENMA," It's going to be okay, Toby. I'm going to get you out!"
 ASTRO BOY," Okay, there."
 TENMA, Excellent.
 SQUIRT, [LAUGHING] Check out the haircut on that one.
 SQUEEGEE, Horns! Good one!
 SQUEEGEE, Whoa! That's creepy.
 SQUIRT," Hang on, buddy! We're coming! We're coming!"
 ELEFUN, I got here as fast as I could.

 CORA, Don't worry. Zog is gonna crush them all.
 ASTRO BOY, That's what happens at the Robot Games?
 CORA," Well, what did you expect? Rock, paper, scissors?"
 ASTRO BOY," I thought it was a show, not a slaughter."
 HAMEGG," They're just robots, son. ASTRO BOY: I thought you liked robots."
 HAMEGG," Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,"

MARIA HILL," Okay, now I want a team of the best there are."
MARIA HILL," I need a team, a team like the Avengers."
MARIA HILL, Never more. [Maria lowers her phone slightly and ends the call with the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.]
CLINT BARTON, How about now?
CLINT BARTON, Alright. Ready your fingers.
COOPER BARTON, Nice.
LAURA BARTON," Nice throw, kiddo."
COOPER BARTON, You go.
LAURA BARTON," Hey, you guys want mayo or mustard, or both? [Camera switches to Lila who then proceeds to look at Clint.]"
LILA BARTON, Who wants mayo on a hotdog?
CLINT BARTON, Probably your brothers.
CLINT BARTON," Uh, two mustard, please! Thanks, mama. [Camera switches to Laura facing Nathaniel]"
LAURA BARTON, Mayo or mustard?
NATHANIEL BARTON, How about ketchup?
LAURA BARTON, Ketchup? [Camera switches back to Clint and his daughter] I can do ketchup.
CLINT BARTON," Mind your elbow. [Lila releases the arrow and it hits the target directly in the bullseye.] Hahaha! Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow."
LAURA BARTON," Hey guys! Enough practice, soup's on!"
CLINT BARTON," Alright, we're coming; we're hungry. [Clint looks behind him, but there's no one there, but dust being blown away by the wind.] Lila, let's go. [Clint starts to look around] Lila? [Clint starts to move and look around, and pick up the bow she had.] Honey? [Clint looks around to see Laura and the boys, only they are gone now. He looks seriously panicked and confused as he hurriedly drops the arrows and jogs over to where they were.] Hey, babe! Babe? Babe? Boys? Boys? Laura?"
NEBULA," Wrra! [Nebula, frustrated, puts her hands in a fighting stance while looking at Tony.]"
TONY STARK," You don't need to do that. Because uh... you're just holding position. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony] Oh yeah, that was close. [Nebula once again flicks a paper football towards Tony] That's a goal. We're now one apiece."
NEBULA, I would like to try again. [Nebula flicks a paper football towards Tony]
TONY STARK, We're tied up. Feel the tension? It's fun.
TONY STARK, That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. [Nebula flicks the paper football towards Tony]
TONY STARK, And... you've won. Congratulations. [Tony reaches his hand out to shake Nebula's hand]
TONY STARK, Fair game. Good sport. [Nebula shakes Tony's hand] Have fun?
NEBULA, It was fun.
TONY STARK," This thing on? [The helmet scans Tony. Tony leans against the wall while taking deep breaths. He looks skinnier and weak with malnutrition.] Hey, Miss Potts... Pep. If you find this recording, don't post it on social media. It's gonna be a real tear-jerker. I don't know if you're ever going to see these. I don't even know if you're... if you're still... Oh god, I hope so. Today is day 21, uh 22. [Cut to Tony standing at a window to stare out in space, waiting for his impending doom to arrive.] You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror of staring into a void of space, I'd say I'm feeling better today. The infection's run its course, Thanks to the blue meanie back there. [Cut to a shot of Nebula sitting in the back of the Benatar.] You'd love her. Very practical. Only a tiny bit sadistic. Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge to buy ourselves about 48 hours of time. [A shot of Tony and Nebula working on the fuel cells of the Benatar.] But it's now dead in the water. We're 1000 light years from the nearest 7-11. Oxygen will run out tomorrow. And that'll be it. And Pep, I ... I know I said no more surprises, but I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like... well you know what it looks like. Don't feel bad about this. I mean, if you grovel for a couple of weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt. I should probably lie down. Please know that... when I drift off, I will think about you. Because it's always you."
TONY STARK, Couldn't stop him.
STEVE ROGERS, Neither could I.
TONY STARK, I lost the kid.
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, we lost."
TONY STARK," Is, uh...? [Tony struggles to ask about Pepper.]"
PEPPER POTTS," Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [She and Tony embrace.]"
TONY STARK, It's okay.
JAMES RHODES, It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," World governments are in pieces. The parts that are still working are trying to take a census. And it looks like he did... he did exactly what he said he was gonna do. Thanos wiped out fifty percent, of all living creatures."
TONY STARK, Where is he now? Where?
STEVE ROGERS, We don't know. He just opened a portal and walked through.
TONY STARK, What's wrong with him?
ROCKET," Oh, he's pissed. He thinks he failed. Which of course he did, but you know there's a lot of that's going around, ain't there?"
TONY STARK," Honestly, until this exact second, I literaly thought you were a Build-A-Bear."
ROCKET, Maybe I am.
STEVE ROGERS," We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. Deep Space scans, and satellites, and we got nothing. Tony, you fought him."
TONY STARK," Who told you that? [Surprised] I didn't fight him. No, he wiped my face with a planet while the Bleecker Street Magician gave away the store. That's what happened. There was no fight."
STEVE ROGERS, Okay.
TONY STARK, He's unbeatable.
STEVE ROGERS," Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?"
TONY STARK, Pfft! I saw this coming a few years back. I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. Thought I was dreaming.
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus."
TONY STARK," [starting to seethe] And I needed you. As in past tense. That trumps what you need. It's too late buddy. Sorry. You know what I need? [Tony stands, pushing things off the table with a clatter. Everyone winces at the noise.] I need to shave. And I believe I remember telling all youse -"
RHODEY," Tony, Tony, Tony!"
TONY STARK, Alive and otherwise what we needed was a suit of armor around the world!
STEVE ROGERS," Well, that didn't work out, did it?"
TONY STARK," I said, ""we'd lose"". You said, ""We'll do that together too."" And guess what, Cap? We lost. And you weren't there. But that's what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We're the Avengers, we're the Avengers. Not the Prevengers."
RHODEY, Okay.
TONY STARK, Right?
RHODEY, You made your point. Just sit down.
TONY STARK, Okay...
RHODEY, Okay?
TONY STARK," Nah, nah. Here's my point. You know what?"
RHODEY," Tony, you're sick."
TONY STARK," [Referring to Carol] She's great, by the way."
RHODEY, Sit down. Sit.
TONY STARK," We need you. You're new blood. Bunch of tired old mules! [Tony walks right up to Steve's face, his voice hushing down to a venomous whisper] I got nothing for you, Cap! I got no coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero. Zip. Nada. No trust. Liar."
TONY STARK," Here, take this. You find him, and you put that on. You hide."
STEVE ROGERS, Tony!
TONY STARK, I'm fine. I...
RHODEY, Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day.
CAROL DANVERS, You guys take care of him. And I'll bring him a Xorrian Elixir when I come back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Where are you going?
CAROL DANVERS, To kill Thanos.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Hey, you know, we usually work as a team here, and between you and I, morale's a little fragile."
STEVE ROGERS," We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight too."
RHODEY, You even know where he is?
CAROL DANVERS, I know people who might.
NEBULA," [Standing behind Carol] Don't bother. I can tell you where Thanos is. Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. And when he worked, he talked about his great plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I'd ask ""where would we go once his plan was complete?"". His answer was always the same: ""To the Garden."""
RHODEY," That's cute, Thanos has a retirement plan."
STEVE ROGERS, So where is he?
ROCKET," When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one's ever seen anything like it... Until two days ago. [A hologram of a planet pops up, with a shockwave visibly traversing the surface.] On this planet."
NEBULA, Thanos is there.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He used the stones again.
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, hey, hey. We'd be going in short-handed, you know."
RHODEY," Look, he's still got the stones, so..."
CAROL DANVERS, So let's get him... Use them to bring everyone back.
RHODEY, Just like that?
STEVE ROGERS," Yeah, just like that."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... I mean we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try.
BRUCE BANNER," If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before?"
CAROL DANVERS," Because before, you didn't have me."
RHODEY," Hey, new girl, everyone here is about that superhero life. And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time?"
CAROL DANVERS," There are a lot of other planets in the universe. And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys."
Thor, I like this one. [smiles]
STEVE ROGERS, Let's go get this son of a bitch.
Title Screen, Avengers: Endgame]
ROCKET," Okay, who here hasn't been to space?"
RHODEY, Why?
ROCKET, You better not throw up on my ship.
NEBULA, Approaching jump in 3... 2... 1!
CAROL DANVERS, I'll head down for recon.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," This is gonna work, Steve."
STEVE ROGERS, I know it will.
STEVE ROGERS, Cause I don't know what I'm going to do if it doesn't.
CAROL DANVERS," No satellites, no ships, no armies, no ground defenses of any kind. It's just him."
NEBULA, And that's enough.
ROCKET, Oh no.
STEVE ROGERS, Where are they?
CAROL DANVERS, Answer the question!
THANOS," The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose, beyond temptation."
BRUCE BANNER, You murdered trillions! [Bruce pushes him to the ground wearing Hulk Buster armor]
THANOS, You should be grateful. [Punched by Hulk Buster]
NATASHA ROMANONFF, Where are the Stones?
THANOS, Gone. Reduced to atoms.
BRUCE BANNER, You used them two days ago!
THANOS, I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. [sits himself a little straighter.] I am... inevitable.
RHODEY," We have to tear this place apart, he-he-he has to be lying."
NEBULA, My father is many things. A liar is not one of them.
THANOS," Ah, thank you, daughter. [Nebula looks down, a little uncomfortable.] Perhaps I treated you too harshly."
ROCKET, What... What did you do?
THOR, I went for the head.
JOE RUSSO," So I, uh... Went on a date the other day. It's the first time in five years, you know? I'm sitting there at dinner... I didn't even know what to talk about."
STEVE ROGERS, What did you talk about?
JOE RUSSO," Same old crap, you know? How things have changed, and... my job, his job... How much we miss the Mets. And then things get quiet... He cried as they were serving the salads."
JIM STARLIN, What about you?
JOE RUSSO," I cried... just before dessert. But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so..."
STEVE ROGERS," That's great. You did the hardest part. You took the jump, you didn't know where you were gonna come down. And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we gotta take. To try and become whole again, try and find purpose. I went in the ice in '45 right after I met the love of my life. Woke up 70 years later. You gotta move on. Gotta to move on. The world is in our hands. It's left to us guys, and we got to do something with it. Otherwise... Thanos should have killed all of us."
Screen Title, SAN FRANCISCO]
Scott Lang," (grunts as he pushes away a cushion out of his body, and deactivates the helmet, but still grunting in pain, as he sweeps away sparks from an electrical failure out of his suit, then try to stand up.) What the hell?"
Scott Lang, Hope?
Scott Lang, [yells] Kid! Hey kid!
Scott Lang, What the hell happened here?
Scott Lang," No. Please. Please, please. [moves on to check the other side of the engraved stone] No, no, no. No. [Lang excuses aside a young couple as he keeps on checking another engraved stone if his daughter's name is on one.] Excuse me, sorry. No, Cassie, no."
Scott Lang," [in a mantra-like] Please, please, please, please... No, Cassie. [Lang looks at the engraved stone in shock, revealing his name in it.]"
Scott Lang, What?
SCOTT LANG, Cassie?
CASSIE LANG," Dad? [Both of them emotionally hug each other as both dad and daughter had reunited. Then Lang shoves her back, realizing that her daughter is now a full-grown teenager.]"
SCOTT LANG, You're so big!
ROCKET," Yeah, we boarded that highly suspect warship Danvers pinged."
 respectively," Nebula and Rocket Raccoon, Okoye, Danvers with a tomboyish haircut, and Rhodes.]"
NEBULA, It was an infectious garbage scowl.
ROCKET," So, thanks for the hot tip. [turns to Danvers and replies back with a smirk]"
CAROL DANVERS," Well, you were closer."
ROCKET, Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [turns to Okoye] You get a reading on those tremors?
OKOYE, It was a mild subduction under the African plate.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Do we have a visual? How are we handling it?
OKOYE," Nat, it's an earthquake under the ocean. We handle it by not handling it."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," [turns to Danvers] Carol, are we seeing you here next month?"
CAROL DANVERS, Not likely.
ROCKET," What, you gonna get another haircut?"
CAROL DANVERS," [irritated] Listen fur-face, I'm covering a lot of territory. The things that are happening on Earth, are happening everywhere, on thousands of planets."
ROCKET," [murmurs to himself] All right, all right, that's a good point. That's a good point."
CAROL DANVERS, So you might not see me for a long time.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Alright. Uh, well. This channel is always active. So, if anything goes sideways... anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... comes through me."
ROCKET, Okay.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Alright.
CAROL DANVERS, [To Rhodey] Good luck. [cuts off call]
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Where are you?
RHODEY, Mexico. The Federales found a room full of bodies. Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never even had the chance to get their guns off.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, It's probably a rival gang.
RHODEY," Except it isn't. (Nat realizes something.) It's definitely Barton. What he's done here, what he's been doing for the last few years... I mean, the scene that he left... (Nat starts to show signs of sadness as she gradually tears up.) I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even want to find him."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Will you find out where he's going next?
RHODEY, Nat...
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Please.
RHODEY, [reluctantly] Okay. [then Rhodes cuts off his]
STEVE ROGERS, You know I'd offer to cook you dinner but you seem pretty miserable already. 
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You here to do your laundry?
STEVE ROGERS, And to see a friend.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Clearly, your friend is fine."
STEVE ROGERS, You know I saw a pod of whales when I was coming up the bridge.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, In the Hudson?
STEVE ROGERS," There's fewer ships, cleaner water."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side. Um... I'm about you to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. [jokingly smiles, as Rogers does the same]"
STEVE ROGERS," Sorry. Force of habit. [Throws his jacket, then sits down on another chair, opposite Natasha.]"
STEVE ROGERS," You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on and... grow. Some do. But not us."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," If I move on, who does this?"
STEVE ROGERS, Maybe it doesn't need to be done.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Deep in her thoughts] I used to have nothing. And then I got this. This job... this family. And I was... I was better because of it. And even though... they're gone... I'm still trying to be better.
STEVE ROGERS, I think we both need to get a life.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Smiling] You first.
Scott Lang," Oh! Hi. Hi! Is anyone home? This is Scott Lang. We met a few years ago, at the airport? In Germany? I got really big, and I had my mask on. You wouldn't recognize me."
STEVE ROGERS, [Standing up] Is this an old message?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Also standing up] It's the front gate.
SCOTT LANG," Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I know you know that. I need to talk to you guys."
STEVE ROGERS, Scott. Are you okay?
SCOTT LANG, Yeah. I'm fine.
SCOTT LANG, Have you ever studied Quantum Physics?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Only to make conversation.
SCOTT LANG," Alright. So... five years ago, right before Thanos, I was in a place called the Quantum Realm. The Quantum Realm is like its own microscopic universe. To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. Hope, she's my... She was my... [struggling to not tell the entire truth about their relationship] She was supposed to pull me out. And then Thanos happened, and I got stuck in there."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I'm sorry. That must've been a very long five years.
SCOTT LANG," Yeah, but that's just it. It wasn't. For me, it was five hours."
SCOTT LANG," See, the rules of the Quantum Realm aren't like they are up here. Everything is unpredictable. Is that anybody's sandwich? I'm starving."
STEVE ROGERS," Scott, what are you talking about?"
SCOTT LANG," What I'm saying is, time works differently in the Quantum Realm. The only problem is right now, we don't have a way to navigate it. But what if we did? I can't stop thinking about it. What if, we could somehow control the chaos, and we could navigate it? What if there was a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time but then exit at another point in time? Like... Like before Thanos."
STEVE ROGERS," Wait, are you talking about a time machine?"
SCOTT LANG," No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. It's more like a... Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy. But I can't stop thinking about it. There's gotta be some way... There's gotta be...some w... it's crazy."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Scott, I get e-mails from a raccoon, so nothing sounds crazy anymore."
SCOTT LANG, So who do we talk to about this?
TONY STARK, [Clapping his hand in a famous beat. Clap! Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap! Clap-Clap-Clap-
MORGAN STARK, Define lunch or be disintegrated. [She puts on a silver and blue helmet similar to Iron Man's]
TONY STARK," Okay, You should not be wearing that, okay? That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. (Takes the helmet off Morgan's head. She emerges out smiling mischievously.)"
MORGAN STARK, Okay.
TONY STARK, There you go. Are you thinking about lunch? I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce.
MORGAN STARK, No.
TONY STARK, That's what you want. How did you find this?
MORGAN STARK, Garage.
TONY STARK, Really? Were you looking for it?
MORGAN STARK," No. I found it, though."
TONY STARK," You like going to the garage, huh? So does daddy. It's fine, actually. Your mom never wears anything I buy her."
SCOTT LANG," (Cut to after Scott's plan has been explained to Tony) Now, we know what it sounds like..."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible?"
TONY STARK," Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that?"
STEVE ROGERS, (Tony giving a drink to him.) Thank you.
TONY STARK," In Layman's terms, it means you're not coming home."
SCOTT LANG, I did.
TONY STARK," No, you accidentally survived. It's a billion to one cosmic fluke. And now you wanna pull off a... What do you call it?"
SCOTT LANG, (Trying to hide his pride) A time heist?
TONY STARK," Yeah, a time heist. Of course, why didn't we think of this before? Oh, because it's laughable? Because it's a pipedream?"
SCOTT LANG, The Stones are in the past. We can go back and get them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everyone back.
TONY STARK," Or screw it up worse than he already has, right?"
STEVE ROGERS, I don't believe we would.
TONY STARK," Gotta say, sometimes I miss that giddy optimism. However, high hopes won't help if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise."
SCOTT LANG," Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. That means no talking to our past selves, no betting on sporting events -"
TONY STARK," I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe is based on Back To The Future?"
SCOTT LANG, [embarrassed] No.
TONY STARK, Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that'd be horse shit. That's not how quantum physics works.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Tony... We have to take a stand.
TONY STARK," We did stand. And yet, here we are."
SCOTT LANG," I know you got a lot on the line. You got a wife, a daughter. But I lost someone very important to me. A lot of people did. [His voice gets louder as he tries to sell his desperation to Tony.] And now, now we have a chance to bring her back. To bring everyone back. And you're telling me that won't even..."
TONY STARK," That's right, Scott, I won't even. I got a kid."
MORGAN STARK, Mommy told me to come and save you.
TONY STARK," Good job. I'm saved. [Turning to face Cap, Nat and Scott.] I wish you'd come here to ask me something else. Anything else. Honestly, I... I missed you guys, it was... Oh, and table's set for six."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, I get it. And I'm happy for you, I really am. But this is a second chance."
TONY STARK," I got my second chance right here, Cap. I can't roll the dice again. If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He's scared.
STEVE ROGERS, He's not wrong.
SCOTT LANG," Yeah, but I mean, what are we gonna do? We need him. What, are we gonna stop?"
STEVE ROGERS," No, I wanna do it right. We're gonna need a really big brain."
SCOTT LANG," (Incredulous, pointing to Tony's house) Bigger than his?"
BRUCE BANNER," Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating. [Pushing a plate forward] Try some of that. Have some eggs."
SCOTT LANG, I'm so confused.
BRUCE BANNER, [seriously] These are confusing times.
SCOTT LANG," Right. No, no, that's not what I meant."
BRUCE BANNER," [dropping the act] No, I get it. I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy. I'm wearing shirts now."
SCOTT LANG, Yeah! Wh...How? Why?
BRUCE BANNER," Five years ago, we got our asses beaten. Except it was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost. Then, we all lost."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," No one blamed you, Bruce."
BRUCE BANNER," I did. For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease, something to get rid of. But then I started looking at him as the cure. Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds..."
GIRL," Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?"
BRUCE BANNER, Yes?
GIRL, Can we get a photo?
BRUCE BANNER," 100%, little person. Come on, step up. [Holding out the phone to Scott] You mind?"
SCOTT LANG," Oh, yeah."
BRUCE BANNER," Thanks, [To the Children] Say ""green""! [The children and Bruce say Green as Scott snaps the photo.]"
BRUCE BANNER, Did you get that?
SCOTT LANG, [leaning forward to hand back the phone] Don't you wanna grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man.
SCOTT LANG," They're Hulk fans, they don't know Ant-Man. Nobody does."
BRUCE BANNER," Wait, no, no, he feels bad. No, he wants you to...he wants to...[to one of the boys] You want to take a picture with him, right? [The boy shakes his head vigorously.]"
BOY, Stranger Danger.
SCOTT LANG, He's even saying no he doesn't. I get it. I don't want it either.
BRUCE BANNER," But, come on, the kid! But he...but you..."
SCOTT LANG, I don't want a picture with them.
BRUCE BANNER, [To the children] He's gonna feel bad. [To Scott] Sorry. They said they'd do it.
SCOTT LANG, I don't want it anymore.
BRUCE BANNER," No, no...you feel bad."
SCOTT LANG," Just take the goddamn phone. [Maybe next time, Scott.]"
GIRL," Thank you, Mr. Hulk."
BRUCE BANNER," No, it's great kids. Thank you very much. [Same time with kids] Hulk out!"
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER, [Awkwardly] Dab!
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce.
BRUCE BANNER, Listen to your Mom. She knows better.
STEVE ROGERS, About we were saying...
BRUCE BANNER," Right. The whole time travel do-over? Guys, it's outside my area of expertise."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Well, you pulled this off. I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible time, too."
TONY STARK," Look at a mod inspiration, let me see what check out. So, recommend one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a mobius strip, inverted, please."
Y, Processing...
TONY STARK," Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle factoring, and a spectral decomp. That will take a second."
Y, Just a moment.
TONY STARK, And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda -
Y, Model rendered.
TONY STARK, Shit!
MORGAN STARK, Shit.
TONY STARK," [Whispering] What are you doing up, little mess?"
MORGAN STARK, Shit.
TONY STARK," No, we don't say that. Only Mommy says that word. She coined it, it belongs to her."
MORGAN STARK, Why you up?
TONY STARK," 'Cause I got some important shit going on here. [Morgan gives Tony a taste of the incredulous] What do you think? No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind."
MORGAN STARK, Was it Juice Pops?
TONY STARK," Sure was. That's extortion. Great minds think alike. Juice Pops, exactly was on... [Looks back to the model, Then turns back] my mind."
TONY STARK," You done? Yeah, now you are. [Tony wipes Morgan's lips and pushes her head onto her pillow] That face goes there."
MORGAN STARK, Tell me a story.
TONY STARK," A story... Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end."
MORGAN STARK, [Giggling] That's a horrible story.
TONY STARK," Come on, that's your favorite story. I love you tons. [Kisses Morgan on the forehead.]"
MORGAN STARK, I love you 3000.
TONY STARK," [Silently] Wow. [Turns off the lamp] 3000. That's crazy. [Closed the door] Go to bed. Or I'll sell all your toys. Night, night."
TONY STARK," Not that it's a competition, but she loves me 3000. You were somewhere on the low 6 to 900 range. [Pepper scoffs]"
TONY STARK, [Absentmindedly] What are you reading?
PEPPER POTTS," Oh, it's just a book on composting."
TONY STARK, [Still absentmindedly] What's new with composting?
PEPPER POTTS, Just -
TONY STARK," I figured it out, by the way."
PEPPER POTTS," You know, just so we're talking about the same thing -"
TONY STARK, Time travel.
PEPPER POTTS," [Amazed] What? Wow... That's amazing, and... terrifying."
TONY STARK, That's right.
PEPPER POTTS, We got really lucky.
TONY STARK," Yeah, I know."
PEPPER POTTS, A lot of people didn't.
TONY STARK," No, I can't help everybody."
PEPPER POTTS, It sort a seems like you can.
TONY STARK," Not if I stop. I can put a pin in it right now, and stop."
PEPPER POTTS," Tony, trying to get you to stop has been one of the few failures of my life."
TONY STARK, I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked box and drop it at the bottom of a lake... go to bed.
PEPPER POTTS, But would you be able to rest?
BRUCE BANNER," Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. Scott, fire up the uhhh... the van thing."
STEVE ROGERS," Breakers are set, emergency generators are on standby."
BRUCE BANNER," Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's. [Scott, Nat and Cap give Bruce a panicked look]"
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, He's kidding. [In a hushed tone to Bruce] You can't say things like that!
BRUCE BANNER, Just... It was a bad joke.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," You were kidding, right?"
BRUCE BANNER," [Whispering to Nat] I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. [Loudly and gives Scott a thumbs up] We're good! Get your helmet on, Scott. I'm gonna send you back a week, let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. Makes sense?"
SCOTT LANG, Perfectly not confusing.
STEVE ROGERS," Good luck, Scott. You got this."
SCOTT LANG," You're right. I do, Captain America."
BRUCE BANNER, On the count of three. 3... 2... 1!
TEEN SCOTT LANG," Uh, guys? This...this doesn't feel right."
STEVE ROGERS, What is this?
BRUCE BANNER, What's going on?
NATASHA ROMANOFF, That...who is that?
BRUCE BANNER, Hold on. [Panicking]
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is that Scott?
TEEN SCOTT LANG," Yes, it's Scott!"
OLD SCOTT LANG, Ow! My back!
STEVE ROGERS, What is this?
BRUCE BANNER, Can I get a little space here.
STEVE ROGERS, Yeah yeah. Can you bring him back?
BRUCE BANNER," I'm working on it! [Tapping the side of the button pad, trying to pull back Scott]"
STEVE ROGERS, It's a baby. [seriously?]
BRUCE BANNER, It's Scott.
STEVE ROGERS, As a baby!
BRUCE BANNER, He'll grow.
STEVE ROGERS, Bring Scott back!
BRUCE BANNER," [motioning to Nat] When I say kill the power, kill the power."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Oh my god. [rapidly walk near to the generator]
BRUCE BANNER, And... Kill it!
SCOTT LANG, Somebody peed my pants.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Oh thank god.
SCOTT LANG," But I don't know if it was ""baby"" me or ""old"" me...Or just ""me"" me."
BRUCE BANNER, [holds up his his hands in a dramatic way] Time travel!
BRUCE BANNER, What? I..I see this as an absolute win!
TONY STARK, Why the long face? Let me guess: He turned into a baby.
STEVE ROGERS," Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here?"
TONY STARK," [Ignoring Steve's question] That's the EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up pushing time through Lang. It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody should've cautioned you against it."
STEVE ROGERS, You did.
TONY STARK," Oh, did I? [acting like he did not; there's the Tony we know] Thank God I'm here. Regardless, I fixed it. [He holds up his right hand, with a device on it] A fully functioning Time-Space GPS. I just want peace. [Makes peace sign with his fingers] Turns out, resentment is corrosive, and I hate it."
STEVE ROGERS, Me too.
TONY STARK," We got a shot at getting these stones, but I gotta tell you my priorities: Bring back what we lost? I hope, yes. Keep what I got? I have to, at all costs. And... maybe not die trying will be nice."
STEVE ROGERS," Sounds like a deal. [Steve reaches out his hand to shake in the deal, in which Tony replies in the same way.]"
STEVE ROGERS, Tony...
TONY STARK," Why? He made it for you. [referring to Howard Stark] Plus, honestly I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding."
STEVE ROGERS," Thank you, Tony."
TONY STARK," Will you keep that a little quiet? Didn't bring one for the whole team. [Hesitates] ...We are getting the whole team, yeah?"
STEVE ROGERS, We're working on that right now.
ROCKET," Hey, humie! Where's Big Green?"
SCOTT LANG," Uh, Kitchen, I think. [To himself as he sees Nebula] That's awesome."
NEBULA," [into an earpiece] Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There's an idiot on the landing zone."
SCOTT LANG," Oh, God!"
RHODEY," What's up, regular sized man?"
ROCKET, Kind of a step down from a golden palace and magic hammers and whatnot.
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, have a little compassion, pal. First they've lost Asgard, then half the people. They're probably just happy to have a home. [Bruce spots Valkyrie looking over at him, and heads over to her.]"
VALKYRIE, You shouldn't have come!
BRUCE BANNER," Ah, Valkyrie! Great to see you, Angry Girl."
VALKYRIE, [Noticing Bruce's change of appearance] I think I liked you better either of the other ways.
BRUCE BANNER, [motioning to Rocket] This is Rocket.
ROCKET, How you doin'?
VALKYRIE, [Eyeing Rocket] He won't see you.
BRUCE BANNER," That bad, huh?"
VALKYRIE," We only see him once a month, when he comes for... [looking over to a pile of kegs of stout and other beer on the side] ... supplies."
BRUCE BANNER, It's that bad.
VALKYRIE, Yeah.
ROCKET, [Grimacing at the smell] What the... Woo! Something died in here.
BRUCE BANNER, Hello? Thor?
THOR, [From another room.] Are you here about the cable?
THOR," The Cinemax ran out about two weeks ago, and the sports were all kind of fuzzy. [He grabs a beer]"
BRUCE BANNER, Thor?
THOR," [He notices Bruce and Rocket standing there. He cracks into joy.] BOYS! Oh my God! Its so to see you! [To Rocket, trying to hug him] Come here, you little rascal! [growling]"
ROCKET," No, I'm good. I'm good. That's not necessary."
THOR," Hulk, you know my friends, Miek, Korg, right?"
KORG, Hey boys!
BRUCE BANNER," Hey guys, long time no see."
KORG," Beer's on the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. No password, obviously. [He goes back to his game.] Thor, he's back. The kid on the TV that called me a dickhead again."
THOR, NoobMaster.
KORG," Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead."
THOR," NoobMaster. Hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder? Listen, buddy. If you don't log off this game immediately, I'm gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in, rip off your arms and SHOVE THEM UP YOUR BUTT! Oh, that's right, go cry to your father, you little weasel!"
KORG," [Thor brings his headphones back] Thank you, Thor."
THOR," Let me know if he bothers you again, okay?"
KORG, Thank you very much. I will.
THOR," So you guys want a drink? What are you drinking? We have beer, tequila, all sorts of things."
BRUCE BANNER," Buddy, you all right?"
THOR," Yes, I'm fine! Why, don't I look all right?"
ROCKET, [Concerned] You look like melted ice cream.
THOR," [Laughs] So, what's up?"
BRUCE BANNER, We need your help. There might be a chance we could fix everything.
THOR," What, like the cable? [burps] Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks."
BRUCE BANNER, Like Thanos.
THOR, Don't say that name.
KORG," Um, yeah. We don't actually say that name in here."
BRUCE BANNER," [quietly] Please take your hand off me. [He brushes away Thor's hand] Now, I know that... guy might scare you."
THOR," Why would I be? Why would, why would I be scared of that guy? I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? Anyone else here killed that guy? Nope. Didn't think so. Korg, why don't you, tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off."
KORG, Umm... Stormbreaker?
THOR," Now, who's swingin' Stormbreaker?"
BRUCE BANNER," I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? I've been there myself. You wanna know who helped me out of it?"
THOR, I don't know. Is it... Natasha?
BRUCE BANNER, It was you. You helped me.
THOR," [walks over and looks out the window and points, still holding his beer] Why don't you ask the, Asgardians down there, how much my help was worth. [he drops onto the sofa] The ones that are left, anyway."
BRUCE BANNER, I think we can bring them back.
THOR," Stop. stop, okay? [opens a packet on M&amp;Ms] I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and and saved. But I'm fine, okay? We're fine, aren't we?"
KORG," Nah, all good here, mate."
THOR," So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it, don't care, couldn't care less. Goodbye."
BRUCE BANNER," [from offscreen] We need you, pal."
ROCKET, [Crossing his arms] There's beer on the ship.
THOR," [pauses, but doesn't look up then puts the bottle down] What kind?"
SCREEN TITLE, TOKYO]
Romanized, Aitsu da! Akihiko-san wo!) (Translated: It's him! He's after Akihiko!)
AKIHIKO, てめえ なぜこんなことをする? 俺たちてめえになにもしてねぇだろ！(Romanized: Temē naze konna koto wo suru? Oretachi temē ni nani mo shitenē daro!) (English: Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you!)
RONIN, [As he draws out his katana and reversibly wields it.]地球の半分 サノスにやられた... お前はなぜ無事なの…(Romanized: Chikyū no hanbun sanosu ni yarareta... Omae wa naze buji nano...) (English: You survived... Half of the planet didn't. They got Thanos... you get me.)
RONIN, [Also in Japanese] お前はもう十分殺しただろ(Romanized:Omae mo jūbun korshita daro) You're done hurting people.
AKIHIKO, [Japanese]俺らがだと? 気でも狂ったか! (Orera ga dato? Ki demo kurutta ka!) [he gestures to all the scattered bodies of his henchmen and chuckles] (English: WE hurt people? You're crazy!)
AKIHIKO, [in a Gatotsu-like sword stance] 死ね! (Romanized: Shine!) (English: DIE!)
AKIHIKO, 待て! 助けてくれ! お前に何でもやる! 何が欲しい? (Romanized: Mate! Tasukete kure! Omae ni nan demo yaru! Nani ga hosī? (English: Wait! Help me! I'll give you anything! What do you want?)
RONIN," [Raising his katana, in English] What I want... You can't give me."
CLINT BARTON, You shouldn't be here.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Neither should you.
CLINT BARTON, I've got a job to do.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is that what you're calling this? Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," We found something. A chance, maybe..."
CLINT BARTON, [Now openly crying] Don't...
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Don't what?
CLINT BARTON, ...don't give me hope.
NATASHA, I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner.
TONY STARK," [To Thor] Drifting left. On the side there, Lebowski. [To Rocket, who's working on something underneath a glass platform] Ratchet, How's it going?"
ROCKET," It's Rocket. Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal."
RHODEY, Time travel suit? Not bad.
SCOTT LANG," [Response to Hulk touching the suit and something red in a glass tube] Hey, hey, hey! Easy, easy!"
BRUCE BANNER, I'm being very careful.
SCOTT LANG," No, you're being very Hulky."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm being careful.
SCOTT LANG," [Holding up the red glass bottle] These are Pym Particles, alright? And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. This is what we have. We're not making any more."
RHODEY," Scott, calm down."
SCOTT LANG," Sorry. We've got enough for one round trip each. That's it. No do-overs. Plus two test runs. [He accidentally presses a button, and shrinks, and then grows back to his normal size.] One test run."
SCOTT LANG, All right. I'm not ready for this.
CLINT BARTON, I'm game. I'll do it.
BRUCE BANNER," Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. Don't worry about it."
RHODEY," Wai-Wait a second, let me ask you something. If we can do this, you know, go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos, you know, and... [he makes a hand gesture suggesting that they strangle baby Thanos with a rope.]"
BRUCE BANNER," [Disgusted] First of all, that's horrible..."
RHODEY, [In a tone that says it's what we're all thinking.] It's Thanos.
BRUCE BANNER," ...And secondly, time doesn't work that way. Changing the past doesn't change the future."
SCOTT LANG," Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved."
CLINT BARTON, Bingo.
NEBULA, That's not how it works.
CLINT BARTON," Well, that's what I heard."
BRUCE BANNER, What? By who? Who told you that?
RHODEY," [counting with his fingers] Star Trek, Terminator, TimeCop, Time After Time -"
SCOTT LANG, Quantum Leap -
RHODEY," A Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time -"
SCOTT LANG, Hot Tub Time Machine -
RHODEY," Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically, any movie that deals with time travel."
SCOTT LANG," Die Hard? No, it's not one..."
RHODEY, This is known.
BRUCE BANNER," I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. Think about it: If you travel to the past, that past becomes your future. And your former present becomes the past. Which can't now be changed by your new future..."
NEBULA, Exactly.
SCOTT LANG, So... Back To The Future's a bunch of bullshit?
BRUCE BANNER," [Turning to Clint] Alright, Clint. We're going in 3... 2... 1!"
LILA BARTON, [offscreen] Cooper? Where are my headphones?
CLINT BARTON," [murmuring] Lila? [The device on his hand starts beeping, signalling the end of this visit] Lila! [He dives for the door, but only manages to open it before he shrinks back to go back to the future.]"
LILA BARTON," Yeah, Dad? [She looks around] Dad?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?"
CLINT BARTON," [Holding up the baseball glove and throw it to Stark] Yeah, it worked. It worked."
STEVE ROGERS," Okay, so the ""how"" works. Now we gotta figure out the when and the where. Almost all of us has had an encounter with at least one of the six Infinity Stones."
TONY STARK, Well I'd substitute the word encounter for damn well near been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones.
SCOTT LANG," I haven't, I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about."
BRUCE BANNER," Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round trip each, and these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history."
TONY STARK," Our history. So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in."
CLINT BARTON, Which means we have to pick our targets.
TONY STARK, Correct.
STEVE ROGERS," Let's start with the Aether. Thor, what do you know?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Is he asleep?
RHODEY," No, I'm pretty sure he's dead."
THOR," Where to start? Umm... The Aether, first, is not a stone, someone called it a stone before. It's more of a... an angry sludge thing, so... someones gonna need to amend that. Here's an interesting story though, many years ago... My grandfather had to hide the stones from the Dark Elves... [He wiggles his fingers to imitate a spooky ghost] Wooooh, scary beings. So Jane, [An image of Jane Foster pops up on the screen] Oh, there she is. That's Jane... She's... an old flame of mine... She... she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... And, she became very, very sick. So I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from. And we had to try and fix her. We were dating at the time, you see. I got to introduce her to my Mother... who's dead, [Thor starts to look broken, and seems on the verge of tears] and oh you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, these things happen though you know, nothing last forever, [Tony starts to push him back to his chair] I'm not done yet, the only thing permanent in life is impermanence."
TONY STARK, Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast?
THOR," I'd like a Bloody Mary, thank you."
ROCKET, Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag.
SCOTT LANG, Is that a person?
ROCKET, Morag's a planet. Quill was a person.
SCOTT LANG, A planet? Like in outer space?
ROCKET," Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. [Imitating talking to a puppy] Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? I'll get you to space."
NEBULA, Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [In a business-like tone] What is Vormir?
NEBULA," A dominion of death, at the very center of Celestial existence. It's where... Thanos murdered my sister."
SCOTT LANG, Not it.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, That Time Stone guy...
BRUCE BANNER, Doctor Strange.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Yeah, what kind of doctor was he?"
TONY STARK, Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit from a hat.
BRUCE BANNER," Nice place in the village, though."
TONY STARK, Yeah. Sullivan Street.
BRUCE BANNER, Hmm... Bleecker.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Wait, he lived in New York?"
TONY STARK, No. He lived in Toronto. Were you even paying attention?
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Guys, if you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York."
BRUCE BANNER, [Sitting up in surprise] Shut the front door.
STEVE ROGERS," All right. We have a plan. Six Stones, three teams. One shot."
STEVE ROGERS," Five years ago, we lost. All of us. We lost friends... We lost family... We lost a part of ourselves. Today, we have a chance to take it all back. You know your teams, you know your missions. Get the stones, get them back. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. Most of us are going somewhere we know. But it doesn't mean we should know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. This is the fight of our lives. And we're gonna win. [Tony gives Steve a look] Whatever it takes. Good luck."
ROCKET,[Refers to Steve's speaking] He's pretty good at that.
SCOTT LANG, Right? [Looks very excited]
TONY STARK," All right. You heard the man. Stroke those keys, jolly green."
BRUCE BANNER, Tractors engaged.
ROCKET," [Addressing the shrunk Benatar in Clint's hand] You promise to bring that back in one piece, right?"
CLINT BARTON," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll do my best."
ROCKET," As promises go, that was pretty lame."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Smiling excitedly] See you in a minute.
STEVE ROGERS," All right, we all have our assignments. Two Stones uptown, one Stone, down. Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock."
STEVE ROGERS, Feel free to smash a few things along the way.
BRUCE BANNER," I think it's gratuitous, but whatever."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm looking for Doctor Strange.
BRUCE BANNER," That, actually."
BRUCE BANNER," Sorry, but I wasn't asking."
BRUCE BANNER," Ah, you're right, I don't. [He makes a grab at the Eye of Agamotto] But I need that stone, and I don't have time to beat it-"
THOR, That's Jane.
ROCKET," All right. Here's the deal, Tubby: You're gonna charm her and I'm gonna poke her with this thing, [He holds up a device.] and extract the Reality Stone and get gone, lickety-split."
THOR," I'll be right back, okay? There's a wine cellar, that's just down there. My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups..."
ROCKET, Hey! Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?
ROCKET, Who's the fancy broad?
THOR, It's my Mother. She dies today.
ROCKET, Oh. That's today?
THOR, I can't do this. I can't do this. I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.This was a bad idea.
ROCKET, Come here. [Standing in front of him]
THOR," No, no, no. I think I'm having...I'm having a panic attack. I shouldn't be here...this is...this is a bad-"
ROCKET, Come here. Right here.
ROCKET," You think you're the only one who lost people? What do you think we're doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna, all gone. Now, I get you miss your Mom. But she's gone. Really gone. And there are plenty of people who are only kinda gone. But you can help them. So is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs outta your beard, make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants, and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone and help me get my family back?"
THOR, Okay.
ROCKET, Are you crying?
THOR, No...Yes!
ROCKET, Get it together! You can do this. You can do this. All right?
THOR," Yes, I can."
ROCKET, Good.
THOR," I can do this. I can do it, I can't do this."
ROCKET," Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone. This is our shot. [He turns back to where Thor was moments ago] Thor? Thor! Aaagh!!!"
RHODEY," Alright. Bring it down low. Right on that line. That's it. Down, down."
CLINT BARTON," Hey, can we hurry it up?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on a clock."
RHODEY," All that, is really helpful. [Hugging Natasha] Take care, okay?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Yeah.
RHODEY, Take that stone and come back. No messing around.
CLINT BARTON, [To Rhodey] Hey. You got this.
RHODEY," Let's get it done. Yes, sir."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, [Walking with Clint back into the ship] See you back.
RHODEY, You guys watch each other's six.
CLINT BARTON, Yeah.
NEBULA, The coordinates for Vormir are laid in. All they have to do is not fall out.
CLINT BARTON, It's a long way from Budapest.
RHODEY," Okay, so, uhh... We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it?"
NEBULA, [Looking around] Let's take cover. We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones.
RHODEY," Wait a minute, what are you talking about right now? Who else is looking for these stones?"
NEBULA," My father, my sister... and me."
RHODEY, And you? Where are you right now?
TONY STARK," Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like they're just about wrapped up here."
STEVE ROGERS, Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now.
TONY STARK," Uh, Mr. Rogers. I almost forgot that that suit [A shot of Cap walking around in his 2012 suit] did nothing for your ass."
STEVE ROGERS," No one asked you to look, Tony."
TONY STARK, [whispers] It's ridiculous.
SCOTT LANG," I think you look great, Cap. As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. [Does a patriotic salute.]"
SCOTT LANG, Who are these guys?
TONY STARK," They are SHIELD...Well, actually Hydra. But, we didn't know that yet."
SCOTT LANG," Seriously, you didn't? I mean...they look like bad guys."
TONY STARK," You're small, but you're talking loud."
TONY STARK," All right, you're up, little buddy. [Looking at the briefcase with the Tesseract] There's our stone."
SCOTT LANG, [Lying down on Tony's shoulder] Alright. Flick me.
TONY STARK," All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the elevator just passing the 80th floor."
STEVE ROGERS, On it. Head to the lobby.
TONY STARK, Alright. I'll see you there.
STEVE ROGERS, Change of plans.
STEVE ROGERS, Rumlow. [everyone starts getting suspicious and has their guard up] I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm gonna be running point on the scepter.
STEVE ROGERS, We got word there may be an attempt to steal it.
STEVE ROGERS, That's okay. Trust me. [Steve leans over to Sitwell's ear.] Hail Hydra.
TONY STARK," Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. It's go-time."
SCOTT LANG, Bombs away. [Sliding down to Tony's Arc Reactor] Is... is that Axe body spray?
TONY STARK," Yeah, I had a can just for emergencies. Relax. Can we focus, please?"
SCOTT LANG, I'm going inside you. Now.
HYDRA AGENT," Hand over the case, Stark."
TONY STARK," [To present Scott through radio as he inhales sharply] All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey up here. Let's go."
SCOTT LANG, You promise me you won't die?
TONY STARK, You're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia.
SCOTT LANG, That doesn't sound mild.
TONY STARK," Do it, Lang!"
TONY STARK, Window's closing. Pull my pin!
SCOTT LANG, Here goes!
TONY STARK," MEDIC! You guys, some help!"
TONY STARK, Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice.
SCOTT LANG," That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?"
TONY STARK," Oh, we blew it."
STEVE ROGERS," Tony, what's going on? Tell me you found that cube. [He looks up and groans.] Oh, you gotta be shitting me."
STEVE ROGERS, [Puts the case down] I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.
STEVE ROGERS," [Standing up] Yeah, I know. I know."
STEVE ROGERS, Bucky... is... alive!
STEVE ROGERS, That is America's ass.
BRUCE BANNER," Please, please!"
BRUCE BANNER," With all due respect, I'm not sure the science really supports that."
BRUCE BANNER," No, but we can erase it. Because once we are done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline at the moment it was taken. So, chronologically, [Holds the Time Stone projection] in that reality, [puts it back to its spot] it never left."
BRUCE BANNER, We will. I will. I promise.
BRUCE BANNER," Then, why the hell did Strange give it away?"
BRUCE BANNER," Strange, he gave it away. He gave it to Thanos."
BRUCE BANNER, Yes!
BRUCE BANNER, I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.
BRUCE BANNER, So he must have done it for a reason.
BRUCE BANNER, Thank you.
THOR, Aah!!!
THOR," OH, God!"
THOR," Yeah, I was simply just going for a walk, and uh... [Trying to hide his belly]"
THOR, I always wear this. This is one of my favorites.
THOR," Oh, my eye. That's... you remember the Battle of Haroquin? When I got hit in the face with a broadsword?"
THOR," [Pretending] Yes, I am."
THOR, I didn't say I'm from the future.
THOR," [voice breaking up] I am totally, totally from the future."
THOR, I really need to talk to you.
THOR, His head was over there... His body over there... What was the point? I was too late. I was just standing there. Some idiot with an axe.
THOR," I guess, yeah."
THOR, That's a little bit harsh.
THOR," I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I?"
THOR," I really missed you, Mum."
ROCKET, Thor! I got it!
THOR," Ma, I have to tell you something."
THOR, But this is about your future.
ROCKET," Hey. You must be Mom. I got the thing. Come on, we got to move."
THOR, I wish we had more time.
THOR," I love you, Mom."
ROCKET, Come on. We gotta go.
ROCKET, Three... two...
THOR," No, wait!"
ROCKET, [To Frigga] Wh- what am I looking at?
THOR, [Happy and a little bit surprised] I'm still worthy.
ROCKET," Oh, boy."
THOR," Goodbye, Mom."
RHODEY, So he's an idiot?
NEBULA, Yeah.
RHODEY, What's that?
NEBULA, The tool of a thief.
RHODEY," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...This is the part where spikes come out with skeletons on the end and everything..."
NEBULA, What are you talking about?
RHODEY," When you break into a place called the temple of the Power Stone, There's gonna be a bunch of booby traps–"
RHODEY, Okay. All right. Go ahead.
NEBULA, I wasn't always like this.
RHODEY," Me either. But we work with what we got, right?"
RHODEY, Sync up. [They both suit up.] Three.. two.. one...
NEBULA," No! He knows! [Runs back to the ship and gets on the comms.] Barton? Barton, come in. Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem. Come on! Come in, we have a prob....Thanos knows. Thanos… He knows."
TONY STARK, Cap–
TONY STARK," Sorry, buddy. We got a– problem."
SCOTT LANG," Huh. Yeah, we do."
STEVE ROGERS," Well, what are we gonna do now?"
TONY STARK," You know what? Give me a break, Steve. I just got hit in the head with the Hulk."
SCOTT LANG, You said that we had one shot. This– this was our shot. We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. Six stones or nothing–
TONY STARK," You're repeating yourself, you know that? You're repeating yourself."
SCOTT LANG, You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. You know– No.
TONY STARK," Dude, come on."
SCOTT LANG," You never wanted a time heist, you went on board with the time heist–"
TONY STARK, I dropped the ball.
SCOTT LANG, You ruined the time heist.
TONY STARK, Is that what I did?
SCOTT LANG, Yeah!
STEVE ROGERS, Are there any other options with the Tesseract?
SCOTT LANG," No, no, no. There's no other options. There's no do-overs. We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. Each. That's it, alright? We use that– Bye, bye. You're not going home."
STEVE ROGERS," Yeah, well if we don't try, then no one else is going home, either."
TONY STARK," I got it. There's another way. To retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. We'll stroll down memory lane. Military installation, Garden State."
STEVE ROGERS, When were they both there?
TONY STARK, They were there at a– I've a vaguely exact idea.
STEVE ROGERS, How vague?
SCOTT LANG, What are you talking about? Where are we going?
TONY STARK, I know for a fact they were there–
SCOTT LANG, Who's they? What are we doing?
TONY STARK, And I know how I know.
SCOTT LANG," Guys, what's up? What is it?"
TONY STARK," Well, it looks like we're improvising."
SCOTT LANG, Right. What are we improvising?
TONY STARK," Scott, get this back to the compound."
TONY STARK, Suit up.
SCOTT LANG, What's in New Jersey?
TONY STARK," 0-4,"
STEVE ROGERS, 0-4– -
TONY STARK," Uhh, 0-7."
STEVE ROGERS, 0-7. -
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me...
TONY STARK, 1-9-7-0.
STEVE ROGERS, Are you sure?
SCOTT LANG," Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry, America. Rogers. Look, if you do this, and this doesn't work, you're not coming back."
TONY STARK," Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. [To Steve] Do you trust me?"
STEVE ROGERS, I do.
TONY STARK, Your call.
STEVE ROGERS, Here we go.
TONY STARK," Clearly, you weren't actually born here, right?"
STEVE ROGERS, The idea of me was.
TONY STARK," Right. Well, imagine you're SHIELD, running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization. Where do you hide it?"
STEVE ROGERS, In plain sight.
TONY STARK," [Leaving the elevator] Good luck on your mission, Captain."
STEVE ROGERS," [Waiting for another floor] Good luck on your project, doctor."
ELEVATOR LADY, You're new here?
STEVE ROGERS, Not exactly.
TONY STARK, [Grabbing Tesseract] Gotcha. Back in the game.
HOWARD STARK," Arnim, you in there? Arnim? Hey! Door's this way, pal."
TONY STARK," Oh, yeah."
HOWARD STARK, I'm looking for Dr. Zola. Have you seen him?
TONY STARK," Yeah, no, Dr. Zol– No, I haven't seen a soul. [awkwardly bumps into a chair] Pardon me."
HOWARD STARK, Do I know you?
TONY STARK," No, sir. I'm a– a visitor from MIT."
HOWARD STARK, Huh. MIT. Got a name?
TONY STARK, Uh– Howard.
HOWARD STARK," Well, that'll be easy to remember."
TONY STARK, Howard– Potts.
HOWARD STARK," Well, I'm Howard Stark. [Holds out hand to shake.]"
TONY STARK, Hi. [Holds Howard's finger]
HOWARD STARK," Shake it, don't pull it."
TONY STARK, Yeah–
HOWARD STARK," You look a little green around the gills there, Potts."
TONY STARK," I'm fine. Just, long hours."
HOWARD STARK," Wanna get some air? Hello, Potts."
TONY STARK, Yeah. That would be swell.
HOWARD STARK, That way.
TONY STARK, Okay.
HOWARD STARK, Need your briefcase?
HOWARD STARK," You're not one of those beatniks, are ya, Potts?"
HANK PYM, That would be the number that you called. Yes.
HANK PYM, Bring it up.
HANK PYM, I'm confused. I thought that was your job.
HANK PYM," They didn't open it, did they?"
HANK PYM, Excuse me! Out of the way!
TONY STARK," So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight?"
HOWARD STARK," My wife's expecting. And, uh– Too much time in the office."
TONY STARK, Congratulations.
HOWARD STARK," Thanks. Hold this, will you?"
TONY STARK," Yeah, sure. How far along is she?"
HOWARD STARK, I don't know– Uh– She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again.
TONY STARK, I have a little girl.
HOWARD STARK, A girl would be nice. Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me.
TONY STARK, What'd be so awful about that?
HOWARD STARK, Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interests.
SECURITY OFFICER, And you've never seen these two men before?
ELEVATOR LADY," No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy."
SECURITY OFFICER, Can you describe them?
ELEVATOR LADY," Well, one of them had a hippie beard."
SECURITY OFFICER, Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?
ELEVATOR LADY, Definitely Mungo Jerry.
SECURITY OFFICER," Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MPs on sub-level 6. We have a potential breach."
TONY STARK," So, where are you at with names?"
HOWARD STARK," Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo."
TONY STARK," Huh, Might wanna let that stew awwhile. You got time."
HOWARD STARK, Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born– were you nervous?
TONY STARK, Wildly. Yeah.
HOWARD STARK, Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing?
TONY STARK," I literally pieced it together as I went along, I thought about what my Dad did, and–"
HOWARD STARK," My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt."
TONY STARK," I thought my dad was tough on me. And now, looking back, I just remember the good stuff, you know. He did drop the odd pearl."
HOWARD STARK, Yeah? Like what?
TONY STARK," ""No amount of money ever bought a second of time."""
HOWARD STARK, Smart guy.
TONY STARK, He did his best.
HOWARD STARK," Let me tell you. That kid's not even here yet, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. Good to meet you, Potts."
TONY STARK," Yeah, Howard– Everything's gonna be all right. Thank you– for everything– you've done for this country."
HOWARD STARK," Jarvis, have we ever met that guy?"
EDWIN JARVIS," You meet a lot of people, sir."
HOWARD STARK, Seems very familiar. Weird beard.
NEBULA, I'm you.
NEBULA, You can stop this. You know you want to. Did you see what happens in the future? Thanos finds the Soul Stone. You wanna know how he does that? You wanna know what he does to you?
CLINT BARTON," Wow– Under different circumstances, this would be totally awesome."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain.
CLINT BARTON," Technically, he's not a raccoon, you know."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Whatever. He eats garbage.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Who are you?
NATASHA ROMANOFF," Oh, good. You tell us where it is. Then we'll be on our way."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, The stone is down there.
CLINT BARTON, How's it going? Jesus...Maybe he's making this shit up.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, No. I don't think so.
CLINT BARTON," Why, 'cause he knows your Daddy's name?"
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I didn't. Thanos left here with the stone without his daughter. It's not a coincidence.
CLINT BARTON, Yeah.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Whatever it takes.
CLINT BARTON, Whatever it takes.
NATASHA ROMANOFF," If we don't get that stone, billions of people stay dead."
CLINT BARTON, Then I guess we both know who it's gotta be.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I guess we do.
CLINT BARTON," I'm starting to think– we mean different people here, Natasha."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, For the last five years I've been trying to do one thing: Get to right here. That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back.
CLINT BARTON," Oh, don't you get all decent on me now."
NATASHA ROMANOFF," What, you think I wanna do it? I'm trying to save your life, you idiot."
CLINT BARTON," Yeah, well, I don't want you to, because I– Natasha, you know what I've done. You know what I've become."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, I don't judge people on their worst mistakes.
CLINT BARTON, Maybe you should.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You didn't.
CLINT BARTON," You're a pain in my ass, you know that?"
CLINT BARTON, Okay. You win.
CLINT BARTON, Tell my family I love them.
NATASHA ROMANOFF, You tell them yourself.
CLINT BARTON, Damn you!
NATASHA ROMANOFF, Let me go.
CLINT BARTON," No. Please, no."
NATASHA ROMANOFF, It's okay.
CLINT BARTON," Please– [Natasha kicks the wall, falls off the rope, and plummets to the ground.] NO!!!"
BRUCE BANNER, Did we get them all?
RHODEY, You telling me this'll actually work?
BRUCE BANNER," Clint, where's Nat?"
TONY STARK, Do we know if she had family?
STEVE ROGERS, Yeah. Us.
THOR, (confused) What?
TONY STARK, I just asked him a question–
THOR," Yeah, you're acting like she's dead. Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? As long as we have the stones, Cap, we can bring her back, isn't that right? [GROWLING.] So stop this shit. We're the Avengers, get it together."
CLINT BARTON, We can't get her back.
THOR, Wha– what?
CLINT BARTON, It can't be undone. It can't.
THOR," I'm sorry. No offense, but you're a very earthly being. Okay? We're talking about space magic. And ""can't"" seems very definitive don't you think?"
CLINT BARTON," (to Thor) Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my paygrade here. But she still isn't here, is she?"
THOR," No, that's my point–"
CLINT BARTON," It can't– be undone. Or that's at least what the red floating guy had to say. (shouts) Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? GO GRAB YOUR HAMMER, AND YOU GO FLY AND TALK TO HIM!"
CLINT BARTON, It was supposed to be me. She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. She bet her life on it.
BRUCE BANNER, She's not coming back. We have to make it worth it. We have to.
STEVE ROGERS, We will.
ROCKET, Boom!
ROCKET," All right. The glove's ready. Question is, who's gonna snap their freaking fingers?"
THOR, I'll do it.
SCOTT LANG, Excuse me?
THOR, It's okay.
EVERYONE," (holding up Thor) No, no, no, whoa. Stop. Stop. Wait a sec. Hey, hey–"
STEVE ROGERS," Wait, wait, Thor, just wait. We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet."
THOR," I'm sorry. What, we're just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity?"
SCOTT LANG, We should at least discuss it.
THOR," No, no, sitting here staring at that thing is not gonna bring everybody back. I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So this responsibility falls upon me. It's my duty."
TONY STARK, It's not about that–
THOR, (hushes everyone up) It's not that– Stop it! Just let me! (he tears up) Just let me do it. Just let me do something good. Something right.
TONY STARK ," Look– It's not just the fact that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent, I'm telling you, you're in no condition."
THOR, What do you– What do you think is coursing through my veins right now?
RHODEY, Cheez Whiz?
THOR, Lightning.
TONY STARK, Yeah.
BRUCE," Lightning won't help you, pal. It's gotta be me."
BRUCE BANNER, You saw what those stones did to Thanos. It almost killed him. None of you could survive.
STEVE ROGERS, How do we know you will?
BRUCE BANNER, We don't. But the radiation's mostly gamma. [He takes a good look at the gauntlet] It's like...I was made for this.
TONY STARK," Good to go, yeah?"
BRUCE BANNER, Let's do it.
TONY STARK," You remember– everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago and just bringing them back to now, today. Don't change anything from the last five years."
BRUCE BANNER, Got it.
TONY STARK," F.R.I.D.A.Y., do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol. Will you?"
BRUCE BANNER, Everybody comes home.
THOR, Take it off! Take it off!
STEVE ROGERS," No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?"
TONY STARK," Talk to me, Banner."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm okay. I'm okay.
STEVE ROGERS, Bruce!
TONY STARK, Don't move him.
BRUCE ROGERS, [Bruce holds onto Steve's arm] Did it work?
THOR, Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.
CLINT BARTON, (struggling to speak from sheer happiness) Honey. Honey.
SCOTT LANG, Guys– I think it worked!
ROCKET, I can't breathe. I can't breathe! I can't breathe.
RHODEY, Canopy. Canopy. Canopy. [Rhodey gets out of his damaged suit]
BRUCE BANNER," Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!"
ROCKET, Hurry up! Hurry up! Come on!
BRUCE BANNER, Rhodey!
RHODEY," Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're in the lower level, it's flooding!"
SCOTT LANG, What?
RHODEY, We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!
SCOTT LANG," Wait! I'm here! I'm here, can you hear me?"
CLINT BARTON, Cap?
CLINT BARTON, [under his breath] Damn.
NEBULA, I tried to kill you. Several times.
NEBULA," But eventually, we become friends. We become sisters."
TONY STARK," Come on, buddy. Wake up. That's my man. [He has Cap's shield.] You lose this again, I'm keeping it."
STEVE ROGERS, What happened?
TONY STARK, You messed with time. It tends to mess back. You'll see.
TONY STARK, What's he been doing?
THOR, Absolutely nothing.
STEVE ROGERS, Where are the stones?
TONY STARK, Somewhere under all this. All I know is he doesn't have them.
STEVE ROGERS, So we keep it that way.
THOR," You know it's a trap, right?"
TONY STARK, Yeah. And I don't much care.
THOR," Good. Just as long we are all in agreement. [Thunder cracks as Thor stretches out both hands to summon both Stormbreaker and Mjolnir (2013). His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment.] Let's kill him properly this time."
TONY STARK, Yep. We're all kinds of stubborn.
STEVE ROGERS, Born out of blood.
RHODEY," See you on the other side, man."
SCOTT LANG, Hang on! I'm coming!
CLINT BARTON," Oh, hey– I know you."
NEBULA, Father.
CLINT BARTON, What?!
NEBULA, You don't have to do this.
NEBULA, You've seen what we become.
NEBULA, You can change.
TONY STARK," Okay, Thor. Hit me."
Y," Boss, wake up!"
THOR, I knew it!
SAM WILSON," Hey, Cap, you read me?"
SAM WILSON," Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me?"
SAM WILSON, On your left.
DOCTOR STRANGE, Is that everyone?
WONG," What, you wanted more?"
STEVE ROGERS, AVENGERS! [he summons Mjolnir] –assemble.
THOR," No, no, give me that. You have the little one. [best meme ever]"
PETER PARKER," Hey! Holy cow! You will not believe what's been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must've passed out, Because I woke up, and you were gone. But Doctor Strange was there, right? He was like, ""It's been five years. Come on, they need us."" And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time–"
TONY STARK," He did? Oh, God."
PETER PARKER, What are you doing?
PETER PARKER," Oh, this is nice."
PETER QUILL, Gamora? [Peter slowly approaches Gamora (2014)] I thought I lost you.
PETER QUILL, Ow.
PETER QUILL, You missed the first time– Then you got them both the second time.
NEBULA," The choices were him, or a tree."
CLINT BARTON," Cap, what do you want me to do with this damn thing?"
STEVE ROGERS, Get those stones as far away as possible!
BRUCE BANNER, No! We need to get them back where they came from.
TONY STARK, No way to get them back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel.
SCOTT LANG, Hold on! [Scott shrinks to normal size and pulls out a remote.] That wasn't our only time machine.
STEVE ROGERS," Anyone see an ugly, brown van up there?"
VALKYRIE, Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked!
TONY STARK," Scott, how long you need to get that thing working?"
SCOTT LANG, Maybe ten minutes.
STEVE ROGERS, Get it started. We'll get the stones to you.
HOPE VAN DYNE," We're on it, Cap."
TONY STARK," Hey. You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? Tell me this is it."
DOCTOR STRANGE," If I tell you what happens, it won't happen."
TONY STARK, You better be right.
THE WASP, It's a mess back here.
SCOTT LANG, It's– it's dead.
THE WASP, What?
SCOTT LANG, It's dead. I have to hotwire it.
CORVUS GLAIVE, She's not responding.
CHALLA, Clint! Give it to me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, You took everything from me.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, You will.
PETER PARKER, I got it!
PETER PARKER, Activate Instant Kill!
CORVUS GLAIVE," But sire, our troops!"
PEPPER POTTS," Uh, is anyone else seeing this?"
PETER PARKER," I got this. I got this! Okay, I don't got this. Help! Somebody, help!"
STEVE," Hey, Queens, heads up."
PEPPER POTTS," Hang on. I got you, kid. [She drops him on Valkyrie's Pegasus]"
PETER PARKER," Hey! Nice to meet you– OH, MY GOD!"
SAM, What the hell is this?
TONY STARK," F.R.I.D.A.Y., what are they firing at?"
ROCKET," Oh, yeah!"
STEVE ROGERS," Danvers, we need an assist here."
PETER PARKER, Hi. I'm– Peter Parker.
CAROL DANVERS," Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?"
PETER PARKER, [Gets up and passes her the gauntlet] I don't know how you're gonna get it through all that.
WANDA MAXIMOFF, Don't worry.
OKOYE, She's got help.
 opening up his hand similar to what Captain America did in Avengers," Infinity War. Thanos headbutts her, but it does nothing. Just as Carol Danvers is gaining the upper hand by rising up and forcing Thanos onto his knees, Thanos pulls the Power Stone out of the Gauntlet and uses it in his free hand to hit Carol Danvers away. Stark looks in question at Strange, who simply raises one finger, reminding him that the one win over Thanos he foresaw is now at risk. Or is it? Stark nods. Thanos puts the Power Stone back into the Gauntlet, yelling from the gamma radiation coursing through him, until Stark makes one last attack on Thanos, pulling on the Gauntlet before Thanos punches him away.]"
TONY STARK, And I– am– Iron Man.
PETER PARKER," Mr. Stark? [He runs up to his fallen mentor. Tears start to form in his eyes] Hey– Mr. Stark? Can you hear me? It's Peter. Hey. We won, Mr. Stark– We won, Mr. Stark. We won. You did it, sir. You did it. [He kneels]"
PETER PARKER, I'm sorry– Tony–
PEPPER POTTS, Hey.
TONY STARK," [quietly] Hey, Pep.."
PEPPER POTTS, F.R.I.D.A.Y.?
PEPPER POTTS, Tony. Look at me. [She makes sure Tony gets a long look at her smiling face] We're gonna be okay. You can rest now.
CLINT," You know, I wish there was a way– that I could let her know. That we won. [Looks over to Wanda.] We did it."
WANDA MAXIMOFF, She knows– They both do.
HAPPY," How you doing, Squirt?"
MORGAN STARK, Good.
HAPPY, You good? Okay. You hungry?
MORGAN STARK, Mm. Hm.
HAPPY, What do you want?
MORGAN STARK, Cheeseburgers.
HAPPY, You know your dad liked cheeseburgers? I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want.
MORGAN STARK, Okay.
VALKYRIE," So, when can we expect you back?"
THOR, Um– about that–
VALKYRIE, Thor. Your people need a king.
THOR," No, they already have one."
VALKYRIE, That's funny. You're being serious?
THOR," It's time for me to be who I am rather than who I'm supposed to be. But you, you're a leader. That's who you are."
VALKYRIE, You know I'd make a lot of changes around here.
THOR, I'm counting on it. Your Majesty.
VALKYRIE, What will you do?
THOR," I'm not sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I– I have no path. I do have a ride, though."
ROCKET," Move it or lose it, hairbag."
THOR," Well, here we are. Tree! Good to see you. Well– [Thor removes his shades and taps Quill on the shoulder] The Asgardians of the Galaxy, back together again. Where to first? [Thor touches the screens map to pick their destination]"
QUILL," Hey, just so you know, this is my ship still. I'm in charge."
THOR," I know. I know. Of course, you are. Of course."
QUILL," See, you say of course, but then you touch the map. It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge."
THOR, Quail– you– that– that's your own–
QUILL, Quail?
THOR, –insecurities in there. Okay? I'm merely trying to be of service and assisting.
QUILL, It's Quill.
THOR, That's what I said.
DRAX, You should fight one another for the honor of leadership.
NEBULA, Sounds fair.
QUILL, It's not necessary.
THOR, It's not.
QUILL, Okay?
ROCKET," I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives."
MANTIS," [enthusiastically] Oooh, yes. Please, use knives."
DRAX," Yeah, knives."
GROOT, I am Groot.
QUILL, Not necessary...
THOR, There shall be no knifing one another. Everybody knows who's in charge.
QUILL," [glances at Thor] Me, right?"
THOR," Yes, you. Of course. Of course. Of course."
BRUCE BANNER," Now, remember– You have to return the stones to the exact moment you got them. Or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities."
STEVE ROGERS," Don't worry, Bruce. Clip all the branches."
BRUCE BANNER," You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. [Looks at Steve] I miss her, man."
STEVE ROGERS," Me, too."
Sam Wilson," You know, if you want, I can come with you."
STEVE ROGERS," You're a good man, Sam. This one's on me, though."
STEVE ROGERS, Don't do anything stupid 'till I get back.
BUCKY BARNES, How can I? You're taking all the stupid with you.
BUCKY BARNES," Gonna miss you, Buddy."
STEVE ROGERS," It's gonna be okay, Buck."
Sam Wilson, How long is this gonna take?
BRUCE BANNER, For him? As long as he needs. For us? Five seconds.
BRUCE BANNER," Ready, Cap? Alright. We'll meet you back here, okay?"
STEVE ROGERS, You bet.
BRUCE BANNER," Going quantum. Three, two, one–"
BRUCE BANNER," And returning in, five, four, three, two, one–"
Sam Wilson, Where is he?
BRUCE BANNER, I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. He should be here.
Sam Wilson," Well, get him back."
BRUCE BANNER, I'm trying.
Sam Wilson, Get him the hell back!
BRUCE BANNER," Hey, I said, I'm trying!"
BUCKY BARNES, Sam...
BUCKY BARNES, Go ahead.
Sam Wilson, Cap?
 STEVE ROGERS," Hi, Sam."
Sam Wilson," So did something go wrong, or did something go right?"
 STEVE ROGERS," Well, after I put the stones back, I thought, maybe I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get."
Sam Wilson, How'd that work out for you?
 STEVE ROGERS, It was beautiful.
Sam Wilson, I'm happy for you. Truly.
 STEVE ROGERS, Thank you.
Sam Wilson, Only thing bumming me out is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America.
 STEVE ROGERS," Oh, That reminds me. [brings out his shield.] Try it on."
 STEVE ROGERS, How does it feel?
Sam Wilson, Like it's someone else's.
 STEVE ROGERS, It isn't.
Sam Wilson, Thank you. I'll do my best.
 STEVE ROGERS, That's why it's yours. [shakes Sam's hand]
Sam Wilson, [seeing elderly Steve's wedding ring] You wanna tell me about her?
 STEVE ROGERS," [smiling] No. No, I don't think I will. [Last lines]"
Closing Title, Marvel Studios]

Ebony Maw," Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan. You may think this is suffering. No... It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... For even in death, you have become Children of Thanos."
Thanos," [Looking out the large window.] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [grabs Thor by the head.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM."
Thor, [exhaustedly spitting blood from his mouth] You talk too much.
Thanos," [to Loki] the Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference."
Loki," Oh, I do. Kill away!"
Loki," [cringing and looking away from his brother's pain and has just thought for a few seconds] ALRIGHT, STOP!"
Thor, We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.
Thor," You really are the worst, brother."
Loki," [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother, the Sun will shine on us again."
Thanos," Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian."
Loki," Well, for one thing: I'm not Asgardian. And for another... We have a Hulk."
Ebony Maw, Let him have his fun.
Heimdall, Allfathers... let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.
Thanos, That was a mistake.
Thor, NO!!! You're going to die for that!
Ebony Maw," Shhhh. [Holding the Tesseract, on one knee] My humble personage... bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp."
Thanos," There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Knowhere."
Corvus Glaive," Father, we will not fail you."
Loki," [Emerging from a separate section of the ship] If I might, interject... If you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena."
Thanos, If you consider failure experience...
Loki," I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos. I, Loki, Heir to Asgard... Frost Giant... The rightful Soldier of Asgard, do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity."
Thanos, “Undying.” You should choose your words more carefully.
Loki," [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You... will never be... a god. [Darkseid snaps Loki's neck, killing him]"
Thanos, No resurrections this time.
Thor, No... Loki...
 Strange, Seriously? You don't have any money?
Wong, Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.
 Strange, I'll tell the guys at the deli. Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical Ham on Rye.
Wong," Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200."
 Strange, Dollars?
Wong, Rupees.
 Strange, Which is
Wong," Uh, buck and a half."
 Strange, What do you want?
Wong, I wouldn't say no to a Tuna Melt.
Bruce Banner, Thanos is coming. He's coming...
 Strange," [Sharing a look with Wong, now in his normal fighting attire] ... Who?"
Title Screen, Avengers: Infinity War)
Tony Stark," Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding."
Pepper Potts, [laughing slightly] You're totally rambling.
Tony Stark," No, I'm not."
Pepper Potts, Lost me.
Tony Stark," Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?"
Pepper Potts, Yeah.
Tony Stark," Okay, and then you're like, “Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?” “Oh! Someone's watching.” “I'm gonna go in my pants.”"
Pepper Potts," Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee."
Tony Stark, Yes.
Pepper Potts, Yeah. Everybody has that.
Tony Stark," Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?"
Pepper Potts, [Nodding in understanding] Right.
Tony Stark, Morgan! Morgan.
Pepper Potts," So you woke up, and thought that we were..."
Tony Stark, Expecting.
Pepper Potts, Yeah.
Tony Stark, [Becoming excited] Yes?
Pepper Potts, [Shaking her head} No.
Tony Stark, I had a dream about it. It was so real. 
Pepper Potts," If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that."
Tony Stark," I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles."
Pepper Potts," It's not helping your case, OK?"
Tony Stark," No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-"
Pepper Potts, {Insistently] You don't need that.
Tony Stark," I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future, us, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know..."
Pepper Potts, Shirts?
Tony Stark, You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
Pepper Potts, You should have shirts in your closet.
Tony Stark, Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Winston. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
Pepper Potts, Yes.
Tony Stark, I will. (Tony kisses Pepper.)
 Strange," Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way."
Tony Stark," I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?"
 Strange," We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake."
Tony Stark, And who's “we”?
Bruce Banner," [Emerges behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony."
Tony Stark, [Looking surprised] Bruce.
Bruce Banner, Pepper.
Pepper Potts, Hi.
Tony Stark, You okay?
Wong," [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurdling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence."
Doctor Strange, Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
Tony Stark, Tell me his name again.
Bruce Banner," Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets, he takes what he wants, he wipes out half the population. He sent Loki! The attack on New York, that's him!"
Tony Stark, [Speaking to himself] This is him...What's our timeline?
Bruce Banner," No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe! If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony..."
Doctor Strange, He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of.
Tony Stark," [Leans against a cauldron, stretching casually] Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?"
Doctor Strange, Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Tony Stark, Is that what this is...?
Tony Stark," [Looking offended] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?"
Doctor Strange, No can do.
Wong, We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.
Tony Stark," And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben &amp; Jerry's named a flavor after me, so..."
Doctor Strange, Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
Tony Stark, It's not bad.
Doctor Strange, A bit chalky.
Wong, “A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge” is our favorite.
Bruce Banner, That's a thing?
Tony Stark, Whatever. Point is: Things change.
Doctor Strange, Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
Tony Stark," And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us."
Doctor Strange," Well, if we don't do our jobs."
Tony Stark," What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?"
Doctor Strange," Protecting your reality, douchebag."
Bruce Banner," Okay, guys, can we quick cable this discussion right now? The fact is that we have the Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now."
Tony Stark," [awkwardly] Yeah, that's the thing."
Bruce Banner, What do you mean?
Tony Stark," Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline."
Bruce Banner," What?! Tony, you lost another super bot?!"
Tony Stark, I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.
Doctor Strange," Who could find Vision, then?"
Tony Stark, Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
Doctor Strange," [sighing in exasperation] Oh, great."
Tony Stark, Maybe. But...
Bruce Banner, [missing the events of Civil War] Call him.
Tony Stark," It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?"
Bruce Banner, No.
Tony Stark, The Avengers broke up. We're toast.
Bruce Banner, Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
Tony Stark, Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.
Bruce Banner," Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not."
Tony Stark," Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?"
Doctor Strange," [Trying to look up at one of his stray hairs fluttering] ... Not at the moment, no."
Tony Stark, You okay?
Tony Stark," Help him! Wong, Doc."
Bruce Banner, Go! Got it!
Tony Stark," [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?"
Tony Stark," Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!"
Doctor Strange, Might wanna use it.
Peter Parker," [Tapping his friend from the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction."
Ned Leeds, Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!
Stan Lee, What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?
Tony Stark," F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders."
Ebony Maw," Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to..."
Tony Stark," I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here."
Ebony Maw, [Looks at Strange] Stone keeper... Does this chattering animal speak for you?
Doctor Strange, Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you're trespassing in this city and on this planet.
Tony Stark, It means get lost Squidward!
Ebony Maw, He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone.
Tony Stark," Banner, you want a piece?"
Bruce Banner," No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?"
Tony Stark, That's right.
Tony Stark," Been a while. Good to have you, buddy."
Bruce Banner," I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man."
Tony Stark, Where's your guy?
Bruce Banner, I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.
Tony Stark, There's no time for a thing.
Bruce Banner, I know.
Tony Stark, That's the thing right there. Let's go.
Tony Stark," {Glances at Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards."
Bruce Banner," Tony, I'm sorry. (STAMMERS) Either I can't or he won't-"
Tony Stark," It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you."
Wong, I have him.
Bruce Banner, Damn it.
Bruce Banner, Where'd that come from?
Tony Stark, It's nano-tech. You like it? A little somet-
Doctor Strange," Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us..."
Tony Stark," Gotta get that stone outta here, now."
Doctor Strange, It stays with me.
Tony Stark, Exactly. Bye.
Bruce Banner," Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?"
Tony Stark," Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?"
Bruce Banner, I'm trying. He won't come out.
Tony Stark, Hammer. [Pushing Bruce out of the way]
Bruce Banner," [begins hitting himself]Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? Come out! Come out! Come out!"
Hulk, No!
Bruce Banner," What do you mean, “no”?"
Peter Parker," Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?"
Tony Stark," Kid, where'd you come from?"
Peter Parker, Field trip to MoMA.
Peter Parker," What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?"
Tony Stark, He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
Ebony Maw, Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.
Doctor Strange, It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.
Ebony Maw, Then I'll take it off your corpse.
Doctor Strange, You'll find...removing a dead man's spell... Troublesome.
Ebony Maw, You'll only wish you were dead. [Strange falls unconscious and is Maw moves to grab him. The Cloak of Levitation flies Strange away} No!
Tony Stark," [As Strange passes through the park] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it."
Peter Parker, On it!
Peter Parker, Not cool!
Peter Parker, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
Tony Stark," Hang on, kid. [As Black Dwarf jumps towards Tony he is sent through a portal. Tony turns towards Wong, the one who made the portal} Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Tony begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Tony's feet thrusters turn morph together into a larger one] Unlock 17-A. [a pod jettisons from the New Avengers Facility] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you."
Peter Parker," But you said save the wizard! [Peter, based on lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!"
Tony Stark, You're too high up. You're running out of air.
Peter Parker, Yeah! That makes sense.
Peter Parker," Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!"
Tony Stark," Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home."
Y, Yup.
Peter Parker," Oh, come on!"
Y," Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts."
Pepper Potts," Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?"
Tony Stark," Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res."
Pepper Potts, Why?
Tony Stark, [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for awhile.
Pepper Potts, Tell me you're not on that ship.
Tony Stark, Yeah.
Pepper Potts," God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship."
Tony Stark," Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say."
Pepper Potts," Come back here, Tony. I swear to God..."
Tony Stark, Pep...
Pepper Potts, Come back here right now! Come back!
Y," Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too..."
Peter Parker, Oh my God. I should have stayed on the bus.
Bruce Banner, Where you going?
Wong, The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?
Bruce Banner, [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.
SPACE, Guardians of the Galaxy)
Peter Quill," (While dancing to the song) Sing it, Drax!"
Rocket, (After yawning briefly) Why are we doing this again?
Gamora," (In annoyance) It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying."
Rocket," I get that, but why are we doing it?"
Peter Quill, ‘Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese for our help.
Gamora, Which isn't the point.
Peter Quill, (Points at Gamora) Which isn't the point... I mean... If he doesn't pony up...
Rocket, We'll take his ship.
Peter Quill, B-b-b-bingo!
Mantis, (Adjusting a few things on the ship) We are arriving.
Peter Quill," All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. (Looks back at Groot is playing a video game) Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. Groot."
Groot, (Now a teenager and playing a handheld gaming device) [in a mocking tone] I am Groot!
Peter Quill, Whoa!
Rocket, Language!
Gamora, Hey!
Drax, Wow.
Peter Quill," You got some acorns on you, kid."
Rocket," Ever since you got your little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna smash that thing to pieces!"
Mantis, What happened?
Rocket, Looks like we're not getting paid.
Rocket, (Waving his hands) Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
Peter Quill, How the hell is this dude still alive?
Drax," He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... This is a man. A handsome, muscular man."
Peter Quill, I'm muscular.
Rocket," Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat."
Peter Quill," Yeah, right."
Drax, It's true. You have gained a little weight... (Drax motions to his chin and belly)
Peter Quill," What? Gamora, do you think I'm..."
Mantis, He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.
Drax, It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.
Peter Quill, Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bowflex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
Rocket," You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?"
Gamora, It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.
Peter Quill, Stop massaging his muscles. Wake him up.
Mantis, Wake.
Thor, Who the hell are you guys?
Gamora," The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre..."
Drax, Including my own.
Gamora," If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. (she snaps her fingers)"
Thor, You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.
Drax, Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.
Thor, Your father killed my brother.
Peter Quill," Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. (Thor softens a bit.)"
Thor," Families can be tough. Look. Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister...that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain."
Peter Quill," And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes-”"
Thor," I need a hammer, not a spoon... (he attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe... Maybe a birth date or something..."
Peter Quill, What are you doing?
Thor, Taking your pod.
Peter Quill," No, you're not! (mimics THOR's accent) You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir."
Rocket, Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
Peter Quill, No.
Drax, You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.
Peter Quill, No I'm not.
Mantis, He just did it again!
Peter Quill, This is my voice!
Thor, (Thor stepping closer to Quill) Are you mocking me?
Peter Quill, Are you mocking me?
Thor, Stop it. You did it again.
Peter Quill, He's trying to copy me.
Thor, Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.
Gamora, Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.
Thor, Knowhere.
Mantis, He must be going somewhere.
Peter Quill," No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. (To Thor as he rummages through there food stores)"
Thor, Not anymore.
Gamora, Thor... Why would he go to Knowhere?
Thor," Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector."
Peter Quill," If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone."
Thor, Or a genius.
Gamora, (To Thor) How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?
Thor," There's six stones out there. Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers."
Peter Quill, The Avengers?
Thor, They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
Mantis, Like Kevin Bacon?
Thor," ...He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome."
Gamora, Then we have to go to Knowhere now.
Thor," Wrong. Where we have to go, is Nidavellir."
Drax, That's a made up word.
Thor, All words are made up.
Rocket," Nidavellir is real? (Climbing on to the table) Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please."
Thor," The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you."
Rocket, Rabbit?
Thor," Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. (To ROCKET) I assume you're the captain, sir?"
Rocket, You're very perceptive.
Thor, You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?
Rocket," Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go."
Thor, Wonderful.
Peter Quill, Except that I'm the captain.
Rocket, Quiet!
Peter Quill, And that's my backpack.
Rocket," Quill, sit down."
Peter Quill," (To Thor) Look, this is my ship. And I'm not going to... Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?"
Thor, The Thanos killing kind.
Peter Quill, Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?
Thor, No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.
Rocket, Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?
Thor, A little bit. Yeah.
Gamora," If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop."
Thor, He already is.
Rocket," I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool."
Thor, So cool.
Peter Quill, (To Rocket) For the record... I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.
Rocket," You know, Quill, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain. (As he enters the pod) Come on, Groot. Put that game down. You'll rot your brain."
Thor," I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye."
Vision, (Holding his hand to the Mind Stone in pain)
Wanda Maximoff, Vis? Is it the stone again?
Vision, It's as if it's speaking to me.
Wanda Maximoff, What does it say?
Vision, I don't... I don't know. But something... Tell me what you feel.
Wanda Maximoff, I just feel you.
Wanda Maximoff, So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.
Vision, What if I miss that train?
Wanda Maximoff, There is an 11.
Vision," What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?"
Wanda Maximoff, You gave Stark your word.
Vision, I'd rather give it to you.
Wanda Maximoff," There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises."
Vision," Not to each other. Wanda... For two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself. – I, I... I think..."
Wanda Maximoff, It works.
Vision, It works.
Vision, Then stay. Stay with me. (a pause) Or not. If I'm overstepping...
Wanda Maximoff, What are they?
Vision, What the stone was warning me about. I have to go.
Wanda Maximoff, No. Vision. If that's true... Then maybe going isn't the best idea.
Vision," Wanda, I... (CORVUS GLAIVE appears suddenly behind vision, stabbing him through the back.)"
Wanda Maximoff, Vision!
Vision, The blade. It stopped me from phasing.
Wanda Maximoff, Is that even possible?
Vision, It isn't supposed to be. My systems are failing. I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.
Wanda Maximoff, Vis!
Corvus Glaive," (to VISION) Give up the Stone, and she lives."
Wanda Maximoff, Hands off.
Wanda Maximoff," Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go."
Vision, Please. Please leave.
Wanda Maximoff, You asked me to stay... I'm staying.
Vision, Please.
Wanda Maximoff, Get up.
Proxima Midnight, (To GLAIVE) Get up.
Corvus Glaive, I can't.
Natasha Romanoff, We don't wanna kill you. But we will.
Proxima Midnight, You'll never get the chance again.
Sam Wilson, (To Vision) Can you stand?
Vision," Thank you, Captain."
Steve Rogers, Let's get you on the jet.
Natasha Romanoff," (Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Aurora) I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances."
Aurora Maximoff, I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Sam Wilson," Where to, Cap?"
Steve Rogers, Home.
s Mother, (To Young Gamora) Shhh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.
Ebony Maw, Zehobereans...
Young Gamora, (As she is dragged away) Mother!
Ebony Maw," Choose a side, or die."
Young Gamora, Mother! (She pulls away from the one who is dragging her and punches him as he leaves)
Ebony Maw," One side, for reservation. The other, an honor..."
Thanos," What's wrong, little one?"
Young Gamora, My mother. Where is my mother?
Thanos, (Kneels down to Gamora) What's your name?
Young Gamora, Gamora.
Thanos," You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. (THANOS takes her hand and leads her to a pavilion, where he produces a small red-jeweled dagger) Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other... Here. You try."
Ebony Maw," Now go in peace, and meet your Maker."
Thanos, Concentrate. There! You've got it.
Peter Quill, Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the “blow off your junk” kind or the gas kind? ‘Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to-
Gamora, I need to ask a favor.
Peter Quill," Yeah, sure."
Gamora," One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos."
Peter Quill, Which is what the grenades are for. (GAMORA silences him with a look.) I'm sorry. What's the favor?
Gamora, If things go wrong... If Thanos gets me... I want you to promise me... you'll kill me.
Peter Quill, (A beat. Confusion.): What?
Gamora, I know something he doesn't. If he finds out... The entire Universe could be at risk.
Peter Quill, What do you know?
Gamora," If I tell you, you'd know, too."
Peter Quill," If it's so important, shouldn't I?"
Gamora, Only if you wanna die.
Peter Quill, Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?
Gamora," Just... trust me. And possibly, kill me."
Peter Quill," I mean, I'd like to. I really would...(GAMORA silences him by covering his mouth with her hand)"
Gamora, Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.
Peter Quill, (beat) Okay.
Peter Quill, Dude! How long have you been standing there?
Drax, An hour.
Peter Quill, An hour? Are you serious?
Drax," I've mastered the ability, of standing so incredibly still... That I've become invisible to the eye. Watch."
Peter Quill, You're eating a zark nut
Drax, But my movement... So slow... And it's imperceptible.
Peter Quill, No.(Peter and Gamora shake their head)
Drax, I'm sure I'm invisible.
Mantis," Hi, Drax."
Drax, Damn it.
DRAX, I'm reading movement. From the third quadrant.
PETER QUILL," Yep. I'm picking that up, too."
QUILL, Let's put it down right here.
THANOS, Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection. I know you have the Reality Stone. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering.
COLLECTOR, I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?
THANOS, I imagine it's like breathing for you.
COLLECTOR, Like suicide.
THANOS, So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.
COLLECTOR, I didn't know what it was.
THANOS," Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, Tivan. Where's the Stone?"
DRAX, Today...
Peter Quill, Drax. Drax.
Drax, ...he pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.
QUILL," Drax, wait! not yet, not yet, not yet. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah."
DRAX, No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.
MANTIS," Sleep. (DRAX is knocked out, causing a ruckus.)"
QUILL," Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... (GAMORA moves towards THANOS.) The other right!"
THANOS," Why? Why you? Daughter... (he falls down, holding his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound. GAMORA breaks down in tears.)"
QUILL, That was quick.
COLLECTOR, Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!
THANOS," Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing. That is, it was. Now... Reality can be whatever I want."
GAMORA, You knew I'd come.
THANOS," I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one."
DRAX, Thanos!
QUILL," Let her go, Grimace!"
GAMORA, Peter...
QUILL, I told you to go right.
GAMORA, Now? Really?
QUILL, You let her go!
THANOS," Ah, the boyfriend."
QUILL, I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long term booty call. Let her go.
GAMORA, Peter...
QUILL, Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack of a chin right off your face!
GAMORA, Not him.
GAMORA, You promised! You promised.
THANOS," Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. (To PETER) She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. (he shoves GAMORA towards PETER's gun, egging him on.) Do it!"
QUILL, I told you to go right.
GAMORA," I love you, more than anything."
QUILL," I love you, too."
THANOS, I like you.
ROSS, Still no word from Vision?
RHODES, Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.
ROSS, On a stolen quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.
RHODES," You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?"
ROSS," My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own."
RHODES," If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here."
ROSS," I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel."
RHODES, That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that.
ROSS, You have second thoughts?
RHODES, Not anymore.
ROGERS, Mr. Secretary.
ROSS, You got some nerve. I'll give you that.
NATASHA, You could use some of that right now.
ROSS," The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?"
ROGERS," I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. And if you wanna stand in our way... We'll fight you, too."
RHODES," All over it. (Turns off hologram) That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap."
ROGERS," You too, Rhodey."
RHODES," Well. You guys, really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years."
SAM," Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star."
BRUCE," Uh, I think you look great. Yeah. I'm back."
NATASHA," Hi, Bruce."
BRUCE, Nat.
SAM WILSON, This is awkward.
BRUCE," So we gotta assume they're coming back, right? And they can clearly find us. We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?"
NATASHA," After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families."
BRUCE, Who's Scott?
ROGERS, Ant-Man.
BRUCE," There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look... Thanos has the biggest army in the Universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... He gets...Vision's stone."
Natasha," Well then, we have to protect it."
VISION," No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps... Its molecular integrity could fail. (VISION addresses WANDA as he nears her)"
AURORA," And you, with it. We're not having this conversation."
VISION, Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.
AURORA, That's too high a price.
VISION," Only you, have the power to pay it. Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him."
ROGERS," But it should. We don't trade lives, Vision."
VISION," (While walking toward Steve) Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?"
BRUCE," Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. Jarvis, Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another."
AURORA, You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?
BRUCE," I'm saying that... If we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts."
NATASHA, Can we do that?
BRUCE, Not me. Not here.
RHODEY," You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back."
ROGERS, (pause) I know somewhere.
Okoye," You'll have the King's Guard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted."
Challa, And the border tribe?
Okoye, Those that are left.
Challa, Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.
Okoye, And what of this one?
Challa, This one may be tired of war. but the White Wolf has rested long enough.
BUCKY, Where's the fight?
CHALLA, On it's way.
Ebony Maw," In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be...judgement. Give me... the stone."
TONY," Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?"
Peter Parker," Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty..."
Tony, What the-
Peter Parker, I know what you're gonna say.
Tony, You should not be here.
Peter Parker, I was gonna go home-
Tony, I don't wanna hear it.
Peter Parker, But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way-
Tony, And now I gotta hear it.
Peter Parker," ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here."
Tony, (seriously) What did you just say?
Peter Parker, I take that back. And now I'm here in space.
Tony, Yeah. Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker, No. I did think this through.
Tony, You could not have possibly thought this through.
Peter Parker," It's just- You can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider – Man when there's no neighborhood. (Pause) Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say."
Tony, Come on. We got a situation. See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.
Peter Parker," Um. Okay. Okay...uh...did you ever see that really old movie, Aliens?"
EBONY MAW, Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...
EBONY MAW, ...could end your friend's life in an instant.
Tony," I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy."
EBONY MAW, You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.
Tony," Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies."
Peter Parker, Yes! Wait what are those!
Peter Parker," Hey, we haven't officially met. (it ignores him and goes to Strange.) Cool."
Strange, We've gotta turn this ship around.
Tony, Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.
Strange," No, I want to protect the stone."
Tony, And I want you to thank me. Go ahead. I'm listening.
Strange, For what? Nearly blasting me into space?
Tony, Who just saved your magical ass? Me.
Strange, I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.
Tony, Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.
Strange," Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you."
Tony," And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup."
Peter Parker, I'm backup.
Tony, No. You're a stowaway. The adults are talking.
Strange," I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. What is he, your ward?"
Peter Parker," No. I'm peter, by the way."
Strange, Doctor Strange.
Peter Parker," Oh we're using our made-up names. Um...I'm Spider-Man, then."
Tony, This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.
Strange, Can we control it? Fly us home? (Tony doesn't make eye contact.) Stark?
Tony, Yeah.
Strange, Can you get us home?
Tony, Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking...I'm not so sure we should.
Strange, Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.
Tony," No. It's you who doesn't understand. Thanos has been inside my head for six years...Since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on out turf or his but you saw what they did, what he can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?"
Strange," (a pause) Alright , Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand...if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it."
Tony," Good. Nice. Moral compass. We're straight. (Turning to Peter, he puts his outstretched arm briefly on either shoulder) Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now."
Thanos, I thought you might be hungry.
Gamora, I always hated that chair.
Thanos, So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.
Gamora, I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.
Thanos, You told me that too. Every day. For almost twenty years.
Gamora, I was a child when you took me.
Thanos, I saved you.
Gamora, No. No. We were happy on my home planet.
Thanos, Going to bed hungry. scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.
Gamora, Because you murdered half the planet.
Thanos, A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora, You're insane.
Thanos," Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, it's resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction."
Gamora, You don't know that!
Thanos," I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. For a time...you had that same will...as you fought by my side. Daughter."
Gamora, I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.
Thanos," And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone."
Gamora, I'm sorry I disappointed you.
Thanos, I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. But because you did. And you lied.
Gamora, Nebula.
Gamora, Don't do this.
Thanos," Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me."
Gamora, Please don't do this.
Thanos, And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.
Gamora, Stop. Stop it. I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.
Memory Nebula," You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them."
Memory Gamora, He can never get them all.
Memory Nebula, He will!
Memory Gamora," He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it."
Thanos, (To Gamora) You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. Where is the Soul Stone?
Gamora, Vormir!
Gamora, The Soul Stone is on Vormir.
Thanos, Show me.
Groot, (Irritably) I am Groot.
Rocket, Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.
Groot, (Still irritably) I am Groot.
Thor," (While looking out the window) Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again."
Rocket, You speak Groot?
Thor," Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
Groot, (shortly) I am Groot.
Thor, You'll know when we're there. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. (nostalgically) It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.
Rocket," Okay, time to be the captain. (walks to a console near by Thor) So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying."
Thor," Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true."
Rocket, And you said your sister and your dad?
Thor, Both dead.
Rocket," Still got a mom, though?"
Thor, Killed by a dark elf.
Rocket, A best friend?
Thor, Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket, Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?
Thor," (Smiling widely) Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret...They're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go."
Rocket," Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about...He's the toughest there is."
Thor," Well, he's never fought me."
Rocket," Yeah, he has."
Thor," He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget."
Rocket, Better be some hammer.
Thor," You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of *morons* and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance."
Rocket, And what if you're wrong?
Thor, If I'm wrong then what more could I lose?
Rocket, I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. (Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person) Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... You're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. (He gives Thor the eyeball)
Thor, What's this?
Rocket, What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.
Thor, He gave you his eye?
Rocket, He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.
Thor," Thank you, sweet rabbit."
Rocket," Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...Hey, we're here!"
Thor, (Smacking his palm against the side of his head) I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.
Rocket, It ain't the eye.
Thor, Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.
Rocket, I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning...Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space...
Thor, This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries...
Rocket," (Looking to a pedestal) You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?"
Thor, Yes. Why?
Rocket, Look anything like that?
Groot, I am Groot.
Rocket, Go back to the pod.
Thor," Eitri, wait! Stop! Stop."
Eitri, Thor?
Thor, What happened here?
Eitri, You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!
Thor," Asgard is destroyed. Eitri, the glove. What did you do?"
Eitri," (He pauses before beginning his solemn story) 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. “Your life is yours.” he said “But your hands are mine alone.”"
Thor," Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've designed, every axe, hammer sword...It's all inside your head. Now I know all hope feels lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos."
Nebula," Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan."
Peter Parker," (To Tony) Hey, what's going on?"
Tony, I think we're here. I don't think this rig has a self-park function. (Instructing Peter to put his arm in the machine for piloting) Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?
Peter Parker," Yep, got it."
Tony," This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time."
Peter Parker, Okay. Okay. Ready.
Tony, We might wanna turn.
Peter Parker, Turn! Turn! Turn!
Tony, (To Strange) You alright?
Tony, That was close. I owe you one.
Peter Parker," Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something...And I end up eating you, I'm sorry."
Tony, (While pointing at Peter) I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?
Peter Parker, I'm trying to say that something is coming.
Drax, (Yelling) Thanos!
Peter Parker," (While crawling backward from Mantis) Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please don't put your eggs in me!"
Lord," Stay down, clown."
Drax," (Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation) Die, blanket of death!"
Lord, Everybody stay where you are. Chill F out. (Quill powers off his helmet) I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?
Tony," Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?"
Drax, I'll do you one better! Why is Gamora?
Lord," Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French fry this little freak."
Tony," Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! (Tony extends his nanotech gun)"
Drax," Do it, Quill! I can take it."
Mantis, No he can't take it!
Strange, She's right. You can't.
Lord, Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. (To Parker) Starting with you.
Strange," Wait, what, Thanos? All right, let me ask you this one time. What master do you serve?"
Lord, What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? “Jesus”?
Tony, You're from Earth?
Lord, I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Tony," Yeah, that's on Earth dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?"
Peter Parker," So, you're not with Thanos?"
Lord," With Thanos? (scoffs) No, I'm here to kill Thanos. He took my girl- Wait, who are you?"
Peter Parker," We're the Avengers, man."
Lord, Oh.
Mantis, You're the ones Thor told us about.
Tony, You know Thor?
Lord," Yeah. Tall guy, not the good-looking, needed saving."
Tony, Where is he now?
Rocket, This is plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?
Eitri," It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost."
Thor, Did it have a name?
Eitri, Stormbreaker.
Rocket, That's a bit much.
Thor, So how do we make it?
Eitri, You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.
Thor," Rabbit, fire up the pod."
Quill, The *heck* happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.
Tony," Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just need the gauntlet."
Tony," Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?"
Drax," I stopped listening after you said, “We need a plan.”"
Tony," (To Quill) Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page."
Quill," See, “not winging it” isn't really what they do."
Peter Parker," Uh, what exactly do they do?"
Mantis," Kick names, take ass."
Drax," (Quietly as he shifts to a commanding position beside Mantis) Yeah, that's right"
Tony," (Tony stands for a moment with an expression of hopelessness) Alright, just get over her, please. Mr. Lord can you get your folks to circle up?"
Quill, “Mr. Lord.” Star-Lord is fine. (Motions to Drax and Mantis)
Tony, We gotta coalesce. ‘Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude..”
Quill," Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what is means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plans, and that way it might be really good."
Drax, Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Tony, What dance-off?
Quill, It's nothing.
Peter Parker," Like in Footloose, the movie?"
Quill, (Excitedly) Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Peter Parker, It never was.
Tony," Don't encourage this, alright?"
Peter Parker, Okay.
Tony, We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.
Quill," Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. (Quill points at Stark and Parker) So that 50% of me that's stupid... That's 100% you."
Tony, Your math is blowing my mind.
Mantis," Excuse me, but...Does your friend often do that?"
Tony," Strange, we alright?"
Tony, You're back. You're alright. Hi.
Peter Parker," Hey, what was that?"
Strange, (Speaking breathlessly) I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.
Quill, How did you see?
Strange," 14,000,605."
Tony, How many did we win?
Strange, One.
Thanos, The stone had better be up there...For your sister's sake.
Stonekeeper," Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros. Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
Thanos, You know us?
Stonekeeper, It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos, Where's the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper, You should know...It extracts a terrible price.
Thanos, I am prepared.
Stonekeeper, We all think that at first. (The figure glides farther out of the shadows and reveals the face of who we know to be Red Skull from Captain America: The First Avenger) We are all wrong.
Thanos, How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull," A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
Red Skull, What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.
Thanos, What's this?
Red Skull, The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.
Thanos, Tell me what it needs.
Red Skull, To ensure that whoever possesses it... Understands its power... The stone demands a sacrifice.
Thanos, Of what?
Red Skull, In order to take the stone you must lose that which you love. A soul...For a soul.
Gamora," All my life, I dreamed of a day...A moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now...You kill and torture...And you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
Thanos, (Turning to face Gamora with tears in his eyes) No.
Gamora, Really? Tears?
Red Skull, They're not for him.
Gamora, No. This isn't love.
Thanos," I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. I'm sorry, little one."
Gamora, No!
Sam," Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0. I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to."
Okoye, (Walking with T'Challa and a band of the King's Guard) When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world...This is not what I imagined.
Challa, And what did you imagine?
Okoye, The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.
Bruce Banner, (To Rhodey) Should we bow?
Rhodes," Yeah, he's a king."
Steve Rodgers, Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. (Shaking hands with T'Challa)
Rhodes, What are you doing?
Challa," Uh, we don't do that here. (He dissuades with a motion of his hand) So how big of an assault can we expect?"
Bruce Banner," Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault."
Steve Rodgers, How we looking?
Challa," You will have my King's Guard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and..."
Bucky," (Walking forward toward Steve) A semi-stable, 100-year-old man."
Steve," How you been, Buck?"
Bucky," Uh, not bad, for the end of the world."
Shuri, Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.
Bruce," Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially."
Shuri, Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?
Bruce," (Staring for a moment) Because, we didn't think of it."
Shuri, (smiling) I'm sure you did your best.
Aurora, Can you do it?
Shuri," Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. (To T'Challa) It will take time, brother."
Steve, How long?
Shuri, As long as you can give me.
Okoye, (Looking at a device that just alerted her) Something's entered the atmosphere.
Sam," (Over the comm) Hey, Cap, we got a situation here."
Bucky," God, I love this place."
Sam," Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome."
Vision, (Appearing beside the window with the others) It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.
Natasha," (Turning toward Vision) Vision, get your *rear* back on the table."
Challa, We will hold them off.
Steve," (To Aurora) Aurora, as soon as the stone's out of his head...you blow it to hell."
Aurora, I will.
Challa, Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. (He points to Steve) And get this man a shield.
Rocket, I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic.You wanna get them moving...You're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.
Thor, Leave that to me.
Rocket," Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a-"
Thor," More power, rabbit!"
Eitri," Well done, boy."
Thor, That's Nidavellir.
Eitri, *Dang* it.
Rocket, “*Dang* it.”? What's “*dang* it?
Eitri, The mechanism is crippled.
Thor, What?
Eitri, With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.
Thor, How long will it take to heat?
Eitri," A few minutes, maybe more. Why?"
Thor, I'm gonna hold it open.
Eitri, That's suicide.
Thor, So is facing Thanos without that axe.
Natasha," How we looking, Bruce?"
Bruce," (While walking) Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually- (He stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands) I'm okay. I'm okay."
Sam, We got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.
Challa, Thank you for standing with us.
Baku," (Translated) Of course, brother."
Natasha, Where's your other friend?
Proxima, You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.
Steve, That's not gonna happen.
Challa, You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.
Proxima," We...Have blood to spare. (She raises her right arm with a cry, and several large ships emerge from the forest behind her.)"
Bucky, Did they surrender?
Steve, Not exactly.
Bucky, What the hell?
Natasha, Looks like we pissed her off.
Okoye, (Watching as the Outriders bombard the dome only a few getting through) They're killing themselves.
Sam, (Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies) You seen the teeth on those things?
Rhodes," Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. (He flies over a section that has been breached and drops a barrage of mines)"
Sam," Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us...There's nothing between them and Vision."
Steve, Them we better keep 'em in front of us.
Okoye, (To T'Challa) How do we do that?
Challa," We open the barrier. (Putting his hand to his ear) On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen."
Wakandan Officer," Requesting confirmation, My King. You said open the barrier?"
Challa, On my signal.
Baku, (To Okoye) This will be the end of Wakanda.
Okoye, Then it will be the noblest ending in history.
Challa," Wakanda Forever! (He crosses his hands over his chest as his Black Panther helmet covers his face, leading the army as they run toward the barrier. T'Challa and Steve are at the front of the advancing army) Now! (The section in the barrier disappears and the Outriders charge at them)"
Challa," How much longer, Shuri? (Over the comm)"
Shuri," We've barely begun, brother."
Challa, You might want to pick up the pace.
Thor," Allfathers, give me strength."
Eitri," You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you."
Thor, Only if I die.
Eitri, Yes. That's what killing you means.
Eitri," Hold it! Hold it, Thor!"
Rocket," (Kneeling over Thor) Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? (To Eitri) I think he's dying."
Eitri," He needs the axe! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!"
Bruce, [laughing with joy] Hah! Hah! Hah! You guys are so screwed now!
Thor," BRING ME THANOS!!! (He charges toward the hoards of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket)"
Strange," Oh, you're much more of a Thanos."
Thanos," I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
Strange, You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos," And where do you think he brought you? (Star-Lord is near by behind wreckage with his weapon ready, and Spiderman is above the structure where Strange sits."
Strange, Let me guess. Your home?
Thanos," (Smiling reminiscently) It was. And it was beautiful. (Thanos uses the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed) Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
Strange, Genocide.
Thanos," But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. (The illusion fades into the true state of Titan)"
Strange, Congratulations. You're a prophet.
Thanos, I'm a survivor.
Strange, Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos," With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that...Mercy."
Strange, And then what?
Thanos, I finally rest...And watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange, I think you'll find our will (Using his hand motions) equal to yours.
Thanos," Ours? (He looks up in time to a see a chunk of wreckage coming down on him, and tries to use the Power to stop, but is too late)"
Iron Man," (Flying in) Piece of cake, Quill."
Quill," (Flying in from the other side) Yeah, if your goal was to *tick* him off."
Lord, Boom!
Strange, (To the Cloak of Levitation) Do not let him close his fist.
Man, Magic. (He kicks him in the head) More magic.
Man, Magic with a kick! (He kicks him again in the head with his right leg)
Man, Magic with a-
Thanos," Insect! (He then throws him, about to use the gauntlet, but is interrupted by an explosion caused by Iron Man shooting a missile at him. As the flames blind Thanos, Spiderman attaches a web to him, and strains against it. Thanos pulls Spiderman toward him, but looks up as a ship crashes beside him, and Nebula jumps in front of him)"
Thanos," Well, well."
Nebula, You should have killed me.
Thanos, It would've been a waste of parts!
Nebula," [she runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!"
Iron Man, [while pulling on the gauntlet] Is he under? Don't let up.
Mantis, [starting to cry] Be quick... He is very strong!
Iron Man," Parker, help! Get over here. [Parker withdraws his web, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go. We gotta open his fingers to get it off!"
Lord," [lands, then joins with the others] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where's Gamora?"
Thanos, ... My... Gamora...?
Lord," Oh, bull–shit. Where is she?"
Mantis, [shocked] He is in anguish!
Lord, Good.
Mantis, [crying] He... he... he mourns!
Drax, What does this monster have to mourn?!
Nebula, [she suddenly understands in horror what Thanos has done with...] Gamora.
Lord, ... What?
Nebula, He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone...but she didn't.
Iron Man," Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, understand?"
Iron Man," Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!"
Lord, Tell me she's lying. [enraged] ASSHOLE!!! Tell me you didn't do it!!!
Thanos, I... had... to.
Lord," [while starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't... No, you didn't... [he continues to rage and then proceeds to pistol-whipping Thanos in the face] NO, YOU DIDN'T!!!"
Drax, Quill!
Iron Man," [to the struggling Quill] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!"
Man, It's coming! It's coming! I got it! I got it...!!
Man," [seeing Mantis flying] Oh, God! [he jumps and hugs her, extending his spider legs which give them a safe landing]"
Stonekeeper," Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros, Gamora, daughter of Thanos."
Thanos, You know us?
Stonekeeper, It is my curse to know all who journey here.
Thanos, Where is the Soul Stone?
Stonekeeper, You should know: it extracts a terrible price.
Thanos, I am prepared.
Stonekeeper, We all think that at first. [his face is revealed as the Red Skull] We are all wrong.
Thanos, How is it you know this place so well?
Red Skull," A lifetime ago, I too sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here, guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess."
Gamora, I was a child when you took me.
Thanos, I saved you.
Gamora," No, no, we were happy on my home planet."
Thanos," Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps? Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I was the one who stopped that. You know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise."
Gamora, Because you murdered half the planet!
Thanos, A small price to pay for salvation.
Gamora, You're INSANE.
Thanos," Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources ... finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correcting."
Gamora, YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!
Thanos," I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only who the will to act on it."
Rocket, You speak Groot?!
Thor," Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective."
Groot, I am Groot?
Thor, You'll know when we're close. Nidavellir's forge harnesses the blazing power of a Neutron Star. It's the birthplace of my hammer; it's truly awesome.
Rocket," [to himself] Okay, time to be the Captain. [to Thor] So, dead brother, huh? That can be annoying."
Thor," Well, he's been dead before. But this time... I think it really might be true."
Rocket, And you said that your sister and your dad...
Thor, Both dead.
Rocket," But, still got a mom, though?"
Thor, Killed by a Dark Elf.
Rocket, Best friend?
Thor, Stabbed through the heart.
Rocket, You sure you're up for this particular murder mission?
Thor," Absolutely. The rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret, they're all tremendous motivators. They truly clear the mind... so, I'm good to go."
Rocket," Yeah, but this is Thanos we're talking about, he's the toughest there is."
Thor," Well, he's never fought me."
Rocket," ... Yeah, he has!"
Thor," Well, he's never fought me twice. And I'll have a new hammer, don't forget."
Rocket," Well, it'd better be some hammer."
Thor," You know, I'm one thousand and five hundred years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one of them would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because Fate wants me alive. Thanos is just the latest in a long line of bastards, and he'll be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so."
Rocket, And what if you're wrong?
Thor," Well, if I'm wrong, then... what more could I lose?"
Gamora," All my life I dreamed of a day, a moment, when you got what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now, you kill and torture and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one."
Thanos, [sheds a tear] No.
Gamora, Really? Tears?
Red Skull, They are not for him.
Gamora, No. This isn't love.
Thanos, I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you.
Thanos," [anguished] I'm sorry, little one."
Gamora, [muted] NO!
Banner, Who's Scott?
Steve Rogers, Ant-Man.
Banner, There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man?!
Stark, [to the Guardians] We gotta work together. Because if all we come out with is a plucky attitude...
Quill," Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. We're more optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except...it sucks. So, let me do the plan and that way...it might be really good."
Drax, Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.
Stark, What dance-off?
Quill, It's not a thing.
Parker, Like in Footloose? The movie?
Quill, Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?
Parker, It never was.
Stark, Don't encourage this alright we're not getting any help from Flash Gordon.
Quill," Flash Gordon? That's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. So that 50% of me that's stupid, that's 100% you."
Strange," Oh, yeah. You're much more of a “Thanos”."
Thanos," I take it that Maw is dead? This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission."
Strange, You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.
Thanos, Where do you think he brought you?
Strange, Let me guess. Your home.
Thanos," It was. [activates the Reality Stone, showing a holographic image of a populated Titan] And it was beautiful. Titan was like most planets; too many mouths, not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution."
Strange, Genocide?
Thanos," At random. Dispassionate, fair; To rich and poor alike. They called me a madman... and what I predicted came to pass."
Strange," Congratulations, you're a prophet."
Thanos, I'm a survivor.
Strange, Who wants to murder trillions.
Thanos," With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers; They would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy."
Strange, Then what?
Thanos, I finally rest and watch the Sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
Strange," [he summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think you'll find our wills equal to yours."
Thanos, Ours?
Stark," Piece of cake, Quill."
Quill," Yeah, if your goal is to piss him off!"
Tony Stark, So this is it. It's all been leading to this.
Thor, Ready?
Steve Rogers, Let's go.
Gamora, He won't stop. Until he destroys half the universe. Everything you know... Everything you love... It will all be gone.
Peter Quill," Let's talk about this plan of yours. I think it's good, except it sucks. So let me do the plan and that way it might be really good."
Tony Stark, Wow.
Thanos," The end is near. When I'm done, half of humanity will still exist. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
Thor," New haircut? I notice you've copied my beard. Oh, by the way, this is a friend of mine. A tree."
Groot, I am Groot.
Steve Rogers, I am Steve Rogers.
Black Panther," Thank you for standing with us, M'Baku."
Baku," Of course, brother."
Black Panther," How much longer, Shuri?"
Bruce Banner," [trying to change into the Hulk] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. Hulk! Hulk! Hulk! [Hulk: NOOOO!] Oh, screw you, you big green asshole! I'll do it myself!"
Thor, I told you. You'd die for that!
Thanos, You should've... You... You should've gone for the head!!
Thor, NO!
Thanos, Daughter?
Gamora, Did you do it?
Thanos, Yes.
Gamora, [beat] What did it cost?
Thanos, [solemnly] ... Everything.
Thor, What did you do? [angrily] WHAT DID YOU DO?!
Captain America, Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?
Bucky Barnes, [feeling his prosthetic arm turning into ash] Steve?
Challa," [while reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [he suddenly disintegrates into ashes and Okoye falls back on the ground, much to her anguish]"
Okoye, Hezvo...?!
Groot," [resting on a tree branch; slowly disintegrating, to Rocket] I am Groot... [Translation: “Dad?”]"
Rocket," [as Groot starts slowly to corrode into ashes, much to Rocket's horror] No... No. No. No. No! Groot... no."
War Machine," [searching for Falcon, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? Sam!? Where you at?!"
Mantis, Something... is... happening. [she gets killed into ashes]
Drax, [to Quill; his right arm and lower-half of his body slowly turns to ashes] Quill...?
Tony Stark," Steady, Quill."
Quill," Aw, man."
Strange," [calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [he finally gets erased]"
Parker, [feels himself starting to disintegrate and doesn't want to die] Mister Stark? I don't feel so good...
Tony Stark, [trying to be calm] You're all right.
Parker," [stumbling] I don't know what's – I don't know what's happening. I don't – [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight and crying] Save me, save me! I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Sir, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... I'm sorry."
Nebula," [to Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory] He did it."
War Machine, What is this? What the hell is happening?
Captain America," ... Oh, God."
Nick Fury, Still no word from Stark?
Maria Hill," No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [receives three beeps from her device]"
Fury, What is it?
Hill, Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.
Fury, Same energy signatures as New York?
Hill, Ten times bigger.
Fury, Call Klein. We'll meet him at –
Hill, NICK!
Fury, They okay?
Hill, There's no one here.
Fury, Call control. Code Red!

Fury," Oh, no. Motherf –"
Narrator,"This is a tale about an unprejudiced heart... and how it changed our valley forever. There was a time not so long ago... when pigs were afforded no respect except by other pigs. They lived their whole lives in a cruel and sunless world. In those days, pigs believed that the sooner they grew large and fat, the sooner they'd be taken into pig paradise."
Narrator,A place so wonderful...that no pig had ever thought to come back.
Narrator,"So when the day came for their parents to go to that other world of endless pleasures, it was not a time for young pigs to be sad. Just another step towards the day when they, too, would make the journey. Perhaps it was because he was alone. Perhaps his sadness made him easier to catch. Whatever the reason, of the thousands of animals in the piggery that day... only one was chosen."
Narrator,"The pig and the farmer regarded each other. And for a fleeting moment, something passed between them.  A faint sense of some common destiny."
Mice, Pigs are definitely stupid.
Narrator," That afternoon when he saw Fly, the pig's mind was a tangle of questions. Cruel, vicious, brutal? What was it that dogs did in the fields all day?"
Babe," Yes, thank you."
Narrator,The old sheep had to be wrong about Fly. And the pig promised himself that he would never think badly of any creature ever again.
Narrator,The morning of the terrible crime... started like any other on Hoggett Farm.
Narrator,"When embarking on an audacious crime, a duck needs a willing accomplice. A creature who is reliable, beyond suspicion, and above all, extremely gullible."
Babe," Who, me?"
Narrator, Now the duck knew exactly what he had to do. The alarm clock had to go. His very life depended on it.
Babe, Ahh. Don't worry. I won't wake the cat.
Babe, But you said you can't do without me.
Babe," Don't sneeze, Ferdie. Just hold your breath."
Narrator," Rex continued long into the night. Elsewhere, there was more talk. The subject was Christmas dinner... and whether that year he main course would be roast pork..."
Narrator,The time comes for all creatures... when childhood ends... and the doorway opens to life as an adult. And so it was with Fly's pups. Though that time was all too soon for Fly.
Narrator,"And so it was that the pig... found his place in the world of the farm. And he was happy, even in his dreams."
Narrator,"And so, it was Christmas Eve. And time had run out for the pig."
Narrator,The pig knew it was against the rules to leave the farm. But something was definitely wrong.
Narrator,"At any other time, the pig would've been tickled pink... by his first visit to the sheep fields. But now there was fear in the air. Maa and her kind were under threat."
Babe,  Maa! What's happening? Who are these men?
Babe, Where's our boss? It doesn't seem right.
Narrator,A dark cloud had descended on the valley. And the pig felt that the troubles were all his fault. But he was certain that he knew how to put things right again.
Narrator," A pig doing the work of a sheepdog? With Rex out of action and Fly injured from the fight, Farmer Hoggett had no choice."
Narrator," When the thought first came to him, Farmer Hoggett dismissed it as mere whimsy. But, like most of his harebrained ideas, it wouldn't go away."
Narrator, It was at that time that Mrs. Hoggett began to worry about her husband. But Farmer Hoggett knew that little ideas... that tickled and nagged and refused to go away... should never be ignored... for in them lie the seeds of destiny.
Narrator, Now the pig understood why the sheep called all dogs wolves. And he was filled with a deep and terrible rage.
Babe, Maa! Maa! Are you all right?
Babe," Oh, Maa, can you get up?"
Babe," It's over, Maa. The wolves have gone far away. I'll get the boss up here to look after you. You'll be all right. You'll be all right! Oh, Maa! Maa!"
Narrator," Fly knew that there was only one fate for any creature... that took the life of a sheep on Hoggett Farm. But Fly could never believe that Babe was a sheep killer, so she remained in the field to do something she'd never talk to the sheep."
Narrator," Farmer Hoggett was carrying something in the crook of one arm. A kind of black, shiny tube."
Narrator," The pig had a vague memory that shiny tubes produced food, and guessed that some quite unexpected surprise... would come out of two small round mouths."
Narrator," Fly decided to speak very slowly, for it was a cold fact of nature that sheep were stupid... and no one would ever persuade her otherwise."
Narrator,The sheep spoke very slowly... for it was a cold fact of nature that wolves were ignorant... and nothing would convince them otherwise.
Narrator," It had been a long time since Arthur Hoggett... had had an animal in whose abilities he had so much faith. And with the National Grand Challenge Sheepdog Trials only two days away, he wasn't going to let the fact that his animal was a pig deter him. He had been worried, for he was a truthful man, that the heading might say ""Name of dog."" And then whatever he put would be a lie. But as it happened, luck, for the moment, was running with him."
Narrator," There are many perfectly nice cats in the world. But every barrel has its bad apples. And it is well to heed the old adage, ""Beware the bad cat bearing a grudge."""
Narrator," And so it was that in all the celebration, in all the hubbub of noise and excitement, there were two figures who stood silent and still... side by side."
Narrator," And though every single human in the stands or in the commentary boxes... was at a complete loss for words, the man, who in his life had uttered fewer words than any of them... knew exactly what to say."
Arthur," That'll do, Pig. That'll do,"
 and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret," ""if only."" If only he hadn't been so careless; if only the weight of the pig and the pump did not exceed the weight of the farmer; if only the farmer did not connect with the platform on the way up... or jam his fingers at the top; if only the pump hadn't fallen off at the bottom; and if only the poor farmer had the presence of mind... to hold onto the rope."
 Such men could have come from only one place, The bank.
t make the , shuttle.
t make the ," shuttle, we won't make it in time for the fair."
Narrator, Esme Hoggett studied the face of the stranger...
Then the thought occurred to him, Maybe it wasn't sheepherding.

Narrator," Sometimes we discover our talents only through necessity. Babe, who never used his nose for anything but the piggish pursuit of food, soon found he could make his way through the trickiest of smellscapes. As the morning wore on, he became quite the virtuoso."
Narrator, The judge had never heard anyone speak so many words in so short a time.

Now let me give you a nickle's worth of advice, young man. This so called ""Doctor"" Brown is dangerous, he's a real nuttcase. You hang around with him, you're gonna end up in big trouble."
Marty, Oh yes sir.
Strickland," You got a real attitude problem, McFly. You're a slacker. You remind me of you father when he went here, he was a slacker too."
Marty," Can I go now, Mr. Strickland?"
Strickland," I noticed you band is on the roster for dance auditions after school today. Why even bother, McFly? You haven't got a chance. You're too much like your own man. No McFly ever amounted to anything <i>in the history of Hill Valley.</i>"

Marty," Yeah I know, I know. ""If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything."""
Jennifer," That's good advice, Marty."
Marty," Alright, okay Jennifer. What if I send in the tape and they don't like it? I mean, what if they say I'm no good? What if they say, ""Get-out of here, kid, you got no future."" I mean, I just don't think I can take that kind of rejection. (sighs) Jesus, I'm beginning to sound like my old"

Jennifer, Does your mom know about tomorrow night?
Marty," No, get out of town, my mom thinks I'm going camping with the guys. Well, Jennifer, my mother would freak out if she knew I was going up there with you. And I'd get this standard lecture about how she never did that kind of stuff when she was a kid. Now look, I think the woman was born a nun."
Jennifer, She's just trying to keep you respectable.
Marty," Well, she's not doing a very good job."
Jennifer, Terrible...
Woman, Save the clock tower! 
Clock Woman," Save the clock tower! Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.

Lorraine," I think it's terrible. Girls chasing boys. When I was your age never chased a boy, or called a boy, or sat in a parked car with a boy."
Linda, Then how am I supposed to ever meet anybody?
Lorraine," Well, it will just happen. Like the way I met your father."
Linda," That was so stupid, Grandpa hit him with the car."
Lorraine," It was meant to be. Anyway, (grabs a cup and plate, heading to the kitchen sink) if Grandpa hadn't hit him, then none of you would have been born."

Lorraine," What was it, George, bird watching?"
George," (absorbed in his work) What Lorraine, what?"
Lorraine," (to Linda and Marty) Anyway, Grandpa hit him with the car and brought him into the house. He seemed so helpless, like a little lost puppy, my heart just went out for him."

Amon Tomaz,"</b> ...came King Ahk-Ton. Using the army to seize power, Ahk-Ton became a tyrant. But he had even darker ambitions. Obsessed with dark magic, Ahk-Ton’s real goal was to forge the Crown of Sabbac."
 and glows in two colors," blue in ""standby mode"" and red whenever it's used]."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> If infused with the powers of the six demons of the ancient world, it would make Ahk-Ton invincible. "
Amon Tomaz,"</b>To make the crown, he needed Eternium. A rare mineral of magic properties, found only in Kahndaq. So he enslaved his own people… and forced them to dig."
Djau,</b> Eternium.
Slaves,</b> Eternium. Eternium.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Kahndaq was teetering on the brink. What they needed…
Boy,</b> Get off him! Get off him!
Amon Tomaz,</b> …was a hero.
Boy, [to the slaves]</b> Why are we fighting each other? Remember who our real enemy is! [to Djau] Come with me.
Djau,</b> Look. Eternium.
Supervisor,</b> Let me see that.
Supervisor,</b> The king thanks you.
Supervisor,</b> Is that right?
Djau,</b> I want what I’m owed.
Supervisor,</b> You want a reward?
Supervisor,</b> The king thanks you for your service.
Supervisor,</b> You want the king’s reward too?
Man,"</b> No, but my son accepts the king’s mercy."
Man,</b> I won’t always be here to protect you.
Boy,"</b> I don’t need protection. I want to be free. If we fight together, we could overthrow the king."
Man,</b> Let someone else be the hero… the graveyards are full of them. Stop dreaming and go back to work.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Someone to hold the hopes of the people. Even when all hope seems lost.
Boy, [turning towards his leaving father]</b> If we had more heroes… then maybe our freedom wouldn’t be a dream!
Boy,</b> Freedom!
Amon Tomaz,</b> King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark could quickly ignite a fire. And so he ordered that it be snuffed out. 
Amon Tomaz,</b> They thought they were getting a martyr. Instead… they got a miracle.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> The Council of Wizards, the magical guardians of the earth…"
Amon Tomaz,</b> …sought to restore the balance. They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods. And turned a boy… into a champion.
All Wizards,</b> S-H-A-Z-A-M!
Ton,</b> Hurry. Give it to me!
Amon Tomaz,</b> But the crown had already been completed.
Ton,</b> Give it to me.
Amon Tomaz,</b> And when the Champion arrived at the palace to challange him… 
Amon Tomaz,"</b> King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power. In the ensuing battle, the palace was destroyed, but the Champion was victorious. The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac… so that it would never again fall into the hands of man. And the Champion was never heard from again."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries, the Intergang, the latest in a series of foreign invaders. But legend says, whenever Kahndaq needs him most, the Champion will return to restore freedom to the people. It has been a long, long wait."
Intergang Mercenary,</b> Show me your papers.
Intergang Commander,</b> Move it along! Have your documentation ready.
Driver,"</b> It’s all our three documents, yeah? Don’t judge the picture, it’s after my girlfriend broke up with me."
Clerk,</b> Open the back. Need a look inside.
Driver,"</b> Yeah, it’s unlocked, man. It’s just a bunch of old TVs. I’m an electrician."
Commander,"</b> Watch where you’re going. You know the drill, back of the line."
Amon Tomaz," [getting back up]</b> Come on, man, you see me every day."
Commander,"</b> And every day I tell ya, if it’s got wheels, it’s a vehicle. Back of the line, mate."
Amon Tomaz, [putting the comics back into his backpack]</b> You’re not my mate.
Commander,"</b> I’m heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> No, what you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer, from halfway around the world, sent here to steal my country’s natural resources, strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our water, oppress our heritage, and make us wait in lines all day."
Driver,"</b> Hey, boss man. Can I go?"
Commander,</b> Hey!
Commander,"</b> Go on, get out of here."
Driver,"</b> Yeah, yeah."
Driver,"</b> Adrianna, we’re clear."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Let’s just move the crown first, and then we can worry about safe."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I gave up my job at the university and moved four times. It doesn’t mean I’m gonna abandon my country.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> We can’t wait for things to cool down this time. If I’m right, they’re days away from finding it."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> What are you doing? 
Amon Tomaz,</b> I want to come with you.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> You know it’s too dangerous. You shouldn’t have gotten involved.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Come on, I want to help you beat those bastards."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> You want to be a hero, huh?  "
Amon Tomaz,"</b> I do, yeah."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Go home, do your homework. Your time will come one day, but not today, son."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Go.
Samir,</b> That would get you a fortune on the black market. Is that real Eternium? Show us a little magic.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> It doesn’t work like that, it’s unrefined."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> You guys should get some rest.
Samir,</b> I thought Intergang seized all the old relics.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Hey, come on. Stop it."
Samir,</b> I’m just curious how she got it.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> My grandmother gave it to me.
Samir,</b> How did she get it? 
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> It’s not a museum piece. It’s a family heirloom, going all the way back to the days when Kahndaq was free."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> You happy now?
Samir,</b> Cool story.
Karim,</b> And all I inherited was a sweater.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> That’s not true. Baba left you his van, and his bald spot."
Karim,"</b> You know, some women like a bald spot. Curly on the outside, smooth on the inside. You know?"
 the camera shows us a truly abhorrent sight," Intergang mines scattered all over, destroying Kahndaq's soil and extracting Eternium for the mercenaries' benefit. The van finally arrives at the right spot. As soon as Karim stops, his companions exit the vehicle and seize their equipment]."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Are you sure about this?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> The inscriptions we found are clear. And I’m positive about that translation. There is something inside that mountain.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> What if it really is the crown? Then what? It’s a source of great power. Who gets to keep it?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> No one. We hide it again someplace else. Get it out of the country if we have to. It is too dangerous for anyone to have.
Samir,</b> This is it?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Not yet.
Samir,</b> Are you coming? 
Karim,</b> Bad knee. I’ll keep watch.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> This way. Almost there.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> “Men were given the gift of magic, but their hearts were too easily corrupted.”"
Samir,</b> Keep reading.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> “The ultimate power was banished from the earth and hidden… here.” Until now.
Samir,"</b> This mountain has kept the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years. We’re 100 percent, totally, no take-backs certain that we want to move it?"
Adrianna Tomaz,</b>We don’t have a choice.
Adrianna,</b> What happened to Ishmael?
Samir,"</b> Great. Don’t worry, I’ll find him."
Karim,"</b> Samir? Samir, what happened?"
Karim,</b> What? I can’t hear you! What are you saying?
Intergang Soldier,</b> Don’t move. Unless you want to join your mate.
Intergang Members,</b> Stay where you are!
Karim,"</b> Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey…"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> “Turn back.”
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> That’s what it says, no?"
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Yes. Where is Samir?
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Claustrophobic. Needed some air. Is this the way to the crown? 
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I think so.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> It’s a tomb.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> “Speak not his power, so he may suffer a dreamless sleep for all eternity”. Teth-Adam. The slave who became champion and defeated the king. The legend was true. Kahndaq… really did have a hero once."
Ishmael Gregor," [skeptically]</b> If he was such a hero, why’d they bury him down here?"
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> The crown.
Intergang Officer,"</b> It’s over. Now, give me the crown."
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Run, Addy! Run!"
Intergang Officer,</b> Hold fire! Don’t hit the crown. Get her!
Intergang Soldiers,</b> Go. Move. Circle around.
Intergang Officer,</b> Get down.
Intergang Officer,</b> Say goodbye to your brother! In five… four… three… two… one…
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I’m over here!
Karim,</b> One?! You let them get to one?
Intergang Officer,</b> Any last words?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Please tell my son…
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b>“Mightiest of mortals… god of gods, Six Immortal Elders by name…”"
Intergang Officer,</b> What?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> “Shazam.”
Intergang Officer,</b> Who the hell is that?
Ishmael Gregor,</b> You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.
Intergang Officer,</b> Check him out.
Intergang Soldiers,</b> Boss say you go... Chief say your turn...
Intergang Soldier,"</b> Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands."
Intergang Officer,</b> Open fire!
Adam, [in Kahndaqi]</b> Your magic is weak.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Go. Go.
Intergang Officer,</b> We need immediate backup. Send everything you’ve got.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Ishmael!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Ishmael!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Let’s go!
Karim,</b> This is as fast as I can go.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Samir! What happened?!
Karim,</b> What didn’t happen.
Karim,</b> Samir fell off of a cliff. I had a gun to my head! Ishmael is buried under a mountain!
Karim,</b> And you summoned some flying magic man! All for what? NOTHING!
Adrianna Tomaz, [triumphantly]</b> Not for nothing.
Intergang Pilot,</b> Light him up.
Intergang Pilot,</b> Shit! Where the hell did he come from? Rotor out! Go! Go!
nd Pilot,</b> I can’t maintain altitude!
motion expires and now we get to see the damage be done in real time," the wreck crashing into a vehicle, the rotor shredding a soldier, the missle pulverizing the ones on the truck and another in the tank, and the electricity atomizing everyone else. Then, that one soldier pulls the grenade out of his mouth]."
Intergang Soldier,"</b> Oh, shit."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Stop! Stop the van!
Karim,</b> Behind you!...
Karim,</b> Did he just catch a rocket?
Karim,"</b> God willing, we won’t see him again."
Karim,"</b> Wait. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? Don’t touch him, he’s made of lightning."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Good point. You get him, you’re the electrician."
Intergang Biker,"</b> Raptor team, come in. What’s your status?"
Intergang Officer,</b> Help me.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> I told you to make it look real, not punch me in the face."
Intergang Biker,"</b> Raptor team, come in. What is your status?"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Status is that everyone is dead.
Intergang Biker,"</b> Ishmael, is that you? What happened?"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> The crown wasn’t the only thing waiting for us down here.
Intergang Biker,</b> Do you have it? 
Ishmael Gregor,</b> No. But I know who does.
Intergang Biker,</b> Copy that. We’re en route to your location.
News Anchors,"</b> This rare, magical mineral has been mined for centuries… …reports of an Eternium blast. It is unknown who or why… …has decimated a number of troops. We are waiting on… …an unidentified male. This being is somehow able to harness…"
Amanda Waller,</b> What do you think?
Carter Hall,"</b> I think this loose cannon needs to be locked down… before innocent people start getting hurt. Oh, and good morning to you, too."
Amanda Waller,"</b> Shove it up your ass, Carter. He’s been asleep for 5,000 years. He’ll be disoriented at first. The longer he has to adapt, the harder it will be to take him down."
Carter Hall,</b> Wheels up in 30.
Amanda Waller,</b> Who’s on the team?
 Assistant,</b> Welcome. Please state your name for identification.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Hi. I’m Maxine Hunkel. I’m here to see Mr Hall.
I Assistant,"</b> Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Thanks.
Carter Hall," [v.o.]</b> Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone. Wind manipulation powers, computer skills, smart as hell. Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ."
Amanda Waller, [v.o.]</b> Sounds delightful.
Amanda Waller,</b> But please tell me you found someone who can pack a punch.
Carter Hall,</b> That’s where Atom Smasher comes in.
Carter Hall," [v.o]</b> Al Rothstein, nephew to the original Atom Smasher. He inherited his uncle’s powers."
Al Pratt,</b> How’s my suit? Does it fit?
Al Rothstein," [clutching the bag with the suit]</b> No, yeah. It’s perfect. Thank you again for letting me borrow it. You know, I used to watch you all the time as a kid? This is literally the only thing that I’d ever wanted in my…"
Al Pratt,"</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don’t let anything happen to it. It’s vintage. And don’t let anything happen to you, either. Don’t do anything crazy. You listen to Carter."
Al Rothstein,"</b> I’m gonna make you proud, Uncle Al. I promise."
Amanda Waller,</b> They seem green.
Carter Hall,</b> That’s why I called in Kent.
Carter Hall," [v.o.]</b>Кent’s been out of action for a little while, but I can’t do this without him. Takes magic to fight magic and the man’s got nearly god-level powers."
Amanda Waller,</b> It might take a lot than that. Are you sure they can take him?
Carter Hall,"</b> Waller, you find us a cell that can hold him… we’ll take care of the rest."
Amanda Waller, [sarcastically]</b> Good luck.
Carter Hall,</b> This is gonna be fun.
 A series of wild images," Hawkman blocking bolts with shield, rocks breaking, Hawkman charging forward, a teal explosion of energy, flybikes, Hawkman screaming... Kent wakes up with terror in his heart. He then learns with some surprise that he has arrived]."
Chauffeur,"</b> We’re here, sir."
Kent Nelson," [exiting the car]</b> Oh, right. Was I staring again?"
Chauffeur,"</b> Only half an hour or so, sir."
Kent Nelson,"</b> Maybe next time, honk the horn."
Chauffeur,"</b> Of course, sir."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> So what’s the op?
Carter Hall,</b> We’re headed to Kahndaq to apprehend and contain… a Class-A rogue metahuman.
Al Rothstein,</b> I didn’t bring passport.
Kent Nelson,</b> We don’t need passports. We’re the Justice Society.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?
Carter Hall,</b> Everyting down to the screws. Completely indestructible. I’ll be in the cockpit if you need me.
Al Rothstein,</b> It’s pretty cool. [to Kent Nelson] You got any snacks?
Al Rothstein,</b> It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Here.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Oh. Thanks. I’m Al, by the way."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Мaxine.
Al Rothstein,</b> What do you do?
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Wind. You?
Al Rothstein,</b> I grow.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Сool.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Wh-Whoa!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Don’t worry about that. I can get another one.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> My mom’s not much of a doctor, but you should probably leave th…"
Amon Tomaz,</b> Or do that.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> I know you have a lot to catch up on. But, I was thinking we could help each other."
Adam,</b> Мove. 
Amon Tomaz,"</b> I’m Amon, by the way."
Adam,</b> I didn’t ask for your name.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> You’re Teth-Adam, right? Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story."
Adam,</b> I said move.
Amon Tomaz,</b> My mom said you took out a bunch of Intergang soldiers in the desert.
Adam,</b> Because they wouldn’t move out of my way.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> So you can really fly and stop bullets, ’cause that’s really crucial to my plan."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> And is it really you stopping the bullets or is it the suit? Wait, what’s your top speed? I’m sure you’re fast, but how fast? Like Flash fast?"
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Wait, did you not have mirrors back then? Wow, I guess a lot does change in 5,000 years."
Adam,</b> Five thousand years?
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Yeah, that’s how long you were in the tomb. Until my mom woke you up. So you’ve got stopping bullets, check; flying, check;"
Amon Tomaz,"</b> ...and lighting thing, that’s a big check."
Adam,</b> I don’t know this place.
Amon Tomaz,</b> This is your home.
Adam,</b> Then my home is gone.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> What happened to the crown?
Karim,</b> Too much?
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> You know it’s cursed with demons, right?"
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> “Life is the… only path to death.”
Karim,</b> No shit.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> “Teth-Adam was a Bronze Age Kahndaqi demi-god.” “He defeated King Ahk-Ton in approximately 2,600 BC.” There. That’s you. See?"
Amon Tomaz,"</b> My point is, Kahndaq still isn’t free. We could really use a superhero right about now."
Adam,</b> I’m no hero.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> What? Superman, Batman, Aquaman… You’re way more stacked than any of them. And they’re not coming to Kahndaq to save us. But you could stop Intergang all by yourself, just like you did King Ahk-Ton. You’re our only hope."
Adam,</b> Wizards.
Karim,</b> I can fix it. Don’t worry. [seeing Teth-Adam's stare upon him] I’m not a wizard.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Hey, Mom. He’s awake."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I told you not to go in your room.
Adam,</b> It was you who spoke. You woke me.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I didn’t have a choice. I’d be dead if it hadn’t worked.
Adam,"</b> The men in my tomb, they were your enemies?"
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Yes.
Adam,"</b> Then your enemies are vanquished, condemned to the eternal sleep of the damned."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Actually, we still have a lot of enemies that need vanquishing."
Adam,</b> Then destroy them.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Intergang have guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets. We have my mom.
Adam,"</b> Prove your strength. Destroy your enemy and all he cares about. Make him beg for mercy, but deny it until his final breath."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Interesting, okay? I appreciate what you did for me, but I do not want you teaching my son violence."
Adam,</b> I understand. [glancing at Karim] You want his father to teach him violence.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Gross, that’s my brother. "
Karim,</b> That’s my sister.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> His father’s dead. 
Adam,"</b> I’m sorry. Who do you want to teach him violence, then?"
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Yeah, Mom. Who do you want to teach me violence?"
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> No one. I want a champion to help free Kahndaq from Intergang. Please, help us."
Amon Tomaz,</b> Wait. Wait! Where are you going? 
Adam,</b> I shouldn’t be here.
Amon Tomaz,</b> You don’t feel any loyalty to us at all?
Adam,"</b> Not really, no."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> You’re not seeing the full possibilities here! I don’t know what it was like in ancient times, but having superpowers is kind of a big deal in our world. Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit, get a cape, change your name."
Adam,</b> Teth-Adam is a very strong name.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> It’s a little outdated. And you definitely need a catchphrase. Something blackout bad-ass to say, right before you absolutely cook some dude."
Adam,</b> I don’t waste words on the dead.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Well, yeah, kind of like that, but more catchy. I was thinking, like, [in a faux deep voice] “Tell them the Man in the Black sent you.”"
Adam,</b> Them? 
Amon Tomaz,"</b> You know, gods, demons… Whoever’s waiting for us in the afterlife. And you wear a lot of black, so we should really lean into that."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> My point is, you could be famous. Magazines, lunch boxes, video games. And the superhero industrial complex is worth a lot of money."
Adam,</b> I don’t need a box for my lunch.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Anyone you’ve ever known is dead. 
Amon Tomaz,</b> What else are you gonna do?
Amon Tomaz,</b> Wait! Where are you going?
Kent Nelson,</b> Waller’s file needs a bit to be desired. Most of this was considered a myth until yesterday afternoon.
Carter Hall,"</b> He’s a bad man, Kent. What else do you need to know?"
Kent Nelson,"</b> When you’ve seen as many different futures as I have, you cease to believe in absolutes."
Kent Nelson,</b> What are you laughing at?
Carter Hall,</b> I’m not laughing. That was a smirk.
Kent Nelson,</b> I know. That’s how you laugh.
Carter Hall,</b> I’ve missed having you around to spout old cryptic shit like that.
Kent Nelson,</b> Almost as much as I’ve missed having you around to ignore all my advice. Carter... [He takes out a box with mint pills] This is not a very good plan.
Carter Hall,"</b> Yeah, well… A bad plan is better than no plan at all."
Kent Nelson, [sucking his mint pill]</b> If only there were a third option.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> I wouldn’t touch that if I was you.
Al Rothstein,</b> Why not?
Maxine Hunkel,</b> ‘Cause that helmet is from another planet. It’s millions of years old.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> It chooses who it lets touch it.
Al Rothstein,</b> Like Kent? 
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Yeah. Like, Kent is leterally possessed when he puts it on."
Al Rothstein,</b> What happens if I touch it anyway?
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Soul crushing terror? Or… something.
Al Rothstein,"</b> So we should probably put a towel on it, right?"
Carter Hall,</b> Coming up on it. Ready stations in five.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?"
Carter Hall,</b> He’s not some dude. He’s a weapon of mass destruction.
Carter Hall,</b> You don’t have to raise your hand.
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Question: if he’s so powerful, how are we supposed to stop him?"
Kent Nelson,"</b> If we can get him to say the word, “Shazam,” Teth-Adam will lose his power. And we’re hoping since he’s had a few thousand years to sleep it off, we can peacefully negotiate the terms of his existence."
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> From the footage you showed us, he doesn’t really seem like a “peacefully negotiate” kind of guy."
Kent Nelson,</b> Correct.
Carter Hall,</b> Look alive. We’re here.
Amon Tomaz, [through the shortwave]</b> This is a message for all Intergang soldiers! Kahndaq has its own official superhero now.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Тeth-Adam!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Please.
Intergang Commander,</b> There he is! Move!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Тeth-Adam! 
Intergang Commander,</b> Move!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Тeth-Adam!…
Intergang Commander,"</b> Get up! Who’s gonna save you now, mate?"
Intergang Commander,</b> The statue?
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> That’s my son. He’s just a boy. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. [To Amon, with fake frustration] What are you doing?"
Intergang Commander,</b> Hang on. I recognize you.
Intergang Commander,</b> Where is the crown?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Let’s go!
Amon Tomaz,</b> You could’ve showed up a bit sooner. But that was dope.
Adam, [proud]</b> Tell them the Man in Black sent you.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Well, yes, but not to me. Say it to the bad guys. But before you zap them."
Adam," [understanding]</b> Catchphrase, then kill. "
Amon Tomaz,</b> Yes.
Kent Nelson,</b> He’s here.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> You sense his presence?
Kent Nelson,</b> No. I assume he’s the only person in Kahndaq that can do that.
Carter Hall,</b> Fate and I’ll take the lead.
Carter Hall," [to Al and Maxine]</b> Listen. Now, you two hang back ’til we call you. We’re the anvil, you’re the hammer. You’re ready."
Al Rothstein," [pointing]</b> He just dropped the, um…"
Carter Hall,</b> Shit.
Kent Nelson,</b> Be prepared.
 warns his comrade,]
Intergang Soldier,</b> Behind you!
Kahndaqi Citizens,</b> Let us be! Let us be!
Carter Hall,"</b> I don’t know their crimes, but whatever they are, these men should face due process."
Adam,</b> Then let the gods make their judgment.
Kahndaqi Citizens,</b> Yeah! Yeeeeah!
Adam,</b> You don’t look like an Intergang.
Carter Hall,</b> We’re the Justice Society. Our mission is to protect global stability. We’re here to restore peace to Kahndaq. And we will use force if necessary.
Adam,</b> Force is always necessary.
Kent Nelson,</b> Teth-Adam.
Kent Nelson,</b> We know who you are and what you are capable of. There’s no place for you in the world of man. You have two choices: kneel or die.
Adam,</b> I was a slave until I died. Then I was reborn a god. I kneel before no one.
Carter Hall,"</b> Fate, give me a distraction!"
Carter Hall,"</b> Just say, “Shazam.” We all go home."
Adam,</b> I don’t have a home.
Al Rothstein,</b> Wow! Look at that suit. It’s cool.
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Thanks. You, too."
Al Rothstein, [stretching in his blue and red one-piece]</b> Thank you. It was a hand-me-down. It was from my uncle.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Hawkman just does not give up, does he? "
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Nope.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Amon, where are you going? Wait!"
Amon Tomaz,</b> To help him!
Kent Nelson,"</b> Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> Let’s roll!
Al Rothstein,</b> What are you doing? Hey. Hey-hey-hey!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> No!
Al Rothstein,</b> I’ll be right there!
Kent Nelson,</b> You have the Crown of Sabbac.
Kent Nelson,</b> I can’t hold him much longer.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Move! [Him and Adrianna rush to the exact location].
Al Rothstein,</b> I’m coming! I’m zeroing in on your location!
Al Rothstein,"</b> I got him! Guys, I got him."
Al Rothstein,"</b> It’s me, Al. In case you didn’t recognize me."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> There’s something different about you. Can’t quite put my finger on it.
Al Rothstein,"</b> You know, it’s probably because I’m six stories tall now. But you… You’re like a tornado."
Kent Nelson,</b> I thought the two of you did great work. First time out… Bravo.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Thanks. I mean, I got a little turned around back there, but, it all worked out, right?"
Carter Hall,</b> You’re damn right it did. Let’s hope Waller has that cell ready for him.
Al Rothstein,"</b> You want me to keep my hand here, right?"
Al Rothstein,</b> Uh... What do I- What do I do? Guys?!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Woo-hoo!
Kahndaqi Citizens,</b> Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion!
Rami,</b> Long live the Champion!
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Yeah, he’s definitely still breathing."
Kahndaqi Citizens,</b> Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion!
Carter Hall,</b> Where are you going? We need to go after him.
Kent Nelson,</b> We’re not strong enough.
Carter Hall,"</b> Oh, well, maybe next time use your powers of prediction to figure that out before we get our asses kicked."
Kent Nelson,</b> I’m working on it!
Kent Nelson,"</b> Miss? Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?"
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Yes, I do mind."
Carter Hall,"</b> Where are you going with this, Kent?"
Kent Nelson,</b> She’s got the Crown of Sabbac.
Carter Hall,</b> One catastrophe at a time. We can’t give him a chance to regroup.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> He’s been spotted entering the palace. It's safe to say he’s not going there to surrender.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Why do you want Teth-Adam to surrender? He’s the Champion of Kahndaq. Who are you? [mockingly] The Justice Society? We have been living under military occupation for 27 years, and never seen you before. You didn’t come when Intergang invaded our country, when they stole our resources and killed my husband. But now, we finally have our own hero… and you decide to fly down here and save us? Thank you, but… we’re covered. Go and protect inernational stability someplace else. Oh, and second, I don’t have the crown."
Carter Hall,</b> Let me spell it out for you. Teth-Adam can’t be Kahndaq’s champion because he is not a hero.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Tell that… [she gestures around the people in the vicinity] to all the people he just liberated.
Carter Hall,</b> I know what this looks like. I do. But I can assure you that my t…
Al Rothstein,</b> I am so sorry. Was that expensive?
Carter Hall,</b> Me and you. When we get back to the ship…
Al Rothstein,"</b> Yes, sir. "
Carter Hall,</b> Me and you. [He turns to Adrianna] I… Can we please just see the crown?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I don’t have it.
Carter Hall,"</b> We don’t have time for this. Teth-Adam first, then the crown."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> You don’t have any authority here. Teth-Adam has done nothing…
Carter Hall,</b> Teth-Adam is not who you think he is.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> And how would you know?
Carter Hall,</b> We have access to ancient texts that have been kept secret for centuries.
Adrianna Tomaz, [in disbelief]</b> And what exactly do these supposed ancient texts say?
Carter Hall,</b> They say that his rage nearly destroyed Kahndaq.
Carter Hall,</b> And we flew all the way over here to stop it from happening again.
Carter Hall,</b> You want to go in there alone? Are you sure?
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> You want to go in and fight Teth-Adam again, be my guest. But if you actually want to resolve things peacefully, without destroying the rest of my city, I’m your only shot."
Adam,</b> You brought the invaders with you.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> They only want to talk.
Adam,</b> They can talk. I won’t listen.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> When I was a little girl, my grandmother told me the story… of how the Champion came to this exact spot… to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle. But according to the Justice Society, that’s not really what happened. They say that you didn’t come here to seek justice."
Ton,</b> Hurry. Give it to me!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> That you came to exact revenge.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> And in your anger…
Ton,</b> Don’t kill me. I can give you anything you want!
Adam,</b> This is what I want.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> …your power grew until it became uncontrollable.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> And the Council of Wizards was forced to deem you unworthy… of the gifts that you were granted.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> It wasn’t your tomb that I opened, was it? It was your prison. And now there’s a statue of you. Out of the hope that someday Kahndaq’s champion would return. But it’s built on a lie, isn’t it?"
Adam,</b> I never said I was a hero. I never claimed to be anything.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> You may not have been a hero. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t be one now.
Adam,"</b> I will hear them out. But if they choose to fight, they choose to die."
Amon Tomaz,</b> Uncle Karim! I can’t believe you’re sitting around watching TV… when the most epic day ever is…
Voice,"</b> In here, little man."
Amon Tomaz,</b> Ishmael. My mom said you got buried in the tomb.
Karim,"</b> Funny story, he didn’t."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Where’s Adrianna?
Amon Tomaz,</b> She’s back at the square… 
Karim,</b> We should go bail her out right now.
Amon Tomaz,</b> But she’s the one who sent me home to make sure the crown’s safe.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Put the bag down. 
Amon Tomaz,</b> What are you doing?
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Back away. Put the bag down, now."
Karim,</b> Give him the bag. Give him the bag.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Very good. Back away.
Ishamel Gregor,</b> Back away. 
Karim,</b> – Oké. I’m…
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> It’s all going to be okay, little man. Let me teach you some history that you’ve never learned… in one of your mother’s classes. [He straigthens up and looks Amon with a serious expression in his eyes] When we had a powerful king, Kahndaq used to be something much better than free. It used to be great."
Karim,"</b> Run, Amon, RUN!"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Crash the building. I lost the kid. He has the crown.
Carter Hall,</b> We’re here to negotiate the terms of your peaceful surrender.
Adam,</b> I’m not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.
Kent Nelson,</b> What have your powers ever given to you? Nothing but heartache.
Adam,</b> You have no idea.
Carter Hall,</b> Then why are you making this hard on us? We both know you’re not supposed to be here.
Adam,</b> It is you who is not supposed to be here. I want you all to leave Kahndaq and never return.
Carter Hall,"</b> Gladly, with you as our prisoner."
Adam,</b> How ’bout I rip your little wings off instead?
Carter Hall,</b> I’d like to see you try. 
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Okay, more fighting won’t solve this."
Adam,</b> I disagree. 
Carter Hall,"</b> Me, too."
Al Rothstein,</b> Looks like we found common ground.
Carter Hall,</b> This can only end one way.
Amon Tomaz, [v.o.]</b> Мom? 
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Amon.
Amon Tomaz,</b> I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Ishmael’s dead.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> No, he shot Uncle Karim, and he’s after the crown."
Intergang Soldiers,</b> Ground forces…
Amon Tomaz,"</b> I’m hiding in our building, and Intergang’s here. They’re coming."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Intergang are after my son.
Kent Nelson,"</b> They don’t want him, they want the Crown of Sabbac."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> I know you’re not a hero. But you’re not a monster, either. I don’t care what anyone says. You saved me in that cave. You didn’t know me and your first instinct was to save me. I’m begging you. Please, save my son."
Intergang Soldiers,</b> Check the whole place clean. Cover all access points. Keep looking!
Intergang Soldiers,</b> Area’s clear.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> There! There! Take him! Take him!
Intergang Soldiers,"</b> Right there, right there!"
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Move, move! Don’t shoot him, I need him!"
Intergang Biker,"</b> End of the road, kid."
Adam,</b> Release the child.
Intergang Biker,</b> Whatever you say!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Yes! Thank you!
Amon Tomaz,</b> But maybe be more careful with your word choice next time.
Amon Tomaz,</b> Оh! And remember your catchphrase!
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Time to go, Amon."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Where’s the crown? 
Amon Tomaz, [feigning ignorance]</b> What crown?
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> You want to be brave, eh? "
Amon Tomaz,</b> I want you to go to hell.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> That’s the plan, little man. We’re gonna go for a ride. Come on."
Intergang Biker,</b> Put me down! Put me down!
Adam,</b> You should really be more careful with your word choice next time. And tell them that the Man in Black…
Ishmael Gregor,</b> He’s right behind me. Where the hell is everybody?!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Mom?
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Amon, where are you?"
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> No, no, no, what?"
Amon Tomaz,</b>I’m in one of their bikes.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> What bikes?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> AMON!!!
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Can you hear me? Mom, I’m okay."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Shit.
Carter Hall,</b> Activate infrared.
Carter Hall,</b> What are you doing?
Adam,</b> Searching for the child.
Carter Hall,"</b> No, you’re murdering people."
Adam,</b> How else do I find the child?
Carter Hall,"</b> I can help you, but no more extrajudicial killings."
Adam,</b> I don’t need any help.
Carter Hall," [through the comms]</b> Smasher, Cyclone. What are you waiting for?"
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Come on, let’s go!"
Al Rothstein,"</b> Okay. Okay. I got this. On the count of three. One, two… This feels a LOT higher than last time... WHOOOAAA!"
Al Rothstein,</b> Ah! That was not cool!
Al Rothstein,"</b> Whoa, slow down."
Al Rothstein,</b> I got you! I got you.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you!"
Al Rothstein,</b> I am so sorry. I don’t really have peripheral vision in the mask. It’s my uncle’s. I’ll get it tailored.
Carter Hall,</b> Me and you.
Al Rothstein,</b> Roger that.
Karim,</b> Who are you? 
Kent Nelson,</b> Call me Dr. Fate.
Karim,"</b> How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?"
Kent Nelson,"</b> I’m not that kind of doctor. But don’t worry, I can see the future. This isn’t how you’re going to die."
Karim,"</b> How do I die, then?"
Kent Nelson,</b> Just stay away from electricity.
Karim,"</b> Wait, what? I’m an electrician. How the hell am I supposed to do that?!"
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Oh, God."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> The Champion’s coming for you. You know that, right?"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> I’m counting on it.
Intergang Pilot,</b> Please don’t.
Kent Nelson,</b> Teth-Adam. Where are you?
Adam,</b> You followed me?
Kent Nelson,</b> My mind and body can exist in different places at the same time. Did you find the boy?
Adam,"</b> Caught one of the bikes, but he didn’t have the child."
Kent Nelson,</b> Bring me the prisoner. I’ll break his mind.
Adam,</b> Uh...
Kent Nelson,"</b> You killed him, didn’t you?"
Adam,</b> He didn’t make it.
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> The bullet’s extracted. The tissue damage has been repaired. Blood pressure, 120 over 81. Heart rate’s at 74 bpm. He’ll be back on his feet in no time."
Al Rothstein, [with admiration]</b> That is insane.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> The nanobots did most of the work.
Al Rothstein,"</b> No, no, no. I’m not gonna let you downplay this. I literally just witnessed a miracle."
Al Rothstein,</b> What? I say something stupid?
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> No, it’s just that you can transform your molecular structure, grow a hundred times your own size. You’re an impossibility and the world still amazes you. I don’t know, it’s… It’s cool."
Al Rothstein,</b> Thank you. But it’s not as cool as nanobots. That’s how you do your wind thing.
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Well, the wind thing is called aerokinesis. And the nanobots were injected into my bloodstream… by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15."
Al Rothstein,</b> I’m… so sorry.
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> No, you’re good."
Al Rothstein,</b> It seems like you really turned it around. Found your calling. Hoping this is mine.
Kent Nelson,</b> There’s no point in dwelling in the past. It’s already moved on from you.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Why did you say that?
Kent Nelson,"</b> You were blaming yourself for trusting Ishmael. Your thoughts are beter spent on the things you can change, not those you can’t."
Adrianna Tomaz, [almost whispering]</b> You see the future? Tell me how I get my son back.
Kent Nelson,</b> By trusting us. Karim will live. We will save Amon. It’s what we do.
Kent Nelson,</b> I suppose they didn’t have doors in your day.
Adam,"</b> Well, of course we did. That’s how we entered rooms."
Kent Nelson,</b> What I did there is called sarcasm.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Where’s Amon? Did you find him?
Adam,"</b> Not yet, but I will. The men who took him will suffer."
Carter Hall,</b> Maybe these guys can help. There’s an upside to keeping prisoners. [Looking at Black Adam accusingly] They can answer our questions.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> What did you do with my son?!
Adam,"</b> Adrianna. Adrianna. I’ve learned that in this modern world, we shouldn’t hurt our prisoners. We should treat them with dignity, respect."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> No.
Adam,</b> Let’s start with just one simple question. Can either of you fly?
Carter Hall,</b> Shit.
Kent Nelson,</b> I think I’ll sit this one out.
Adam,</b> Tell me what you did with Amon.
Carter Hall,</b> You’d better not drop those prisoners.
Adam,</b> I’m not going to drop them. [He then looks menacingly at them both] I’m going to drop one of them. Whoever answers first lives. Where is he?
Carter Hall,"</b> Oh, you gotta be kidding me."
Kent Nelson,</b> You said you wouldn’t hurt the prisoners.
Adam,</b> That was sarcasm.
Kent Nelson,"</b> No, technically, it was just a lie."
Adam,</b> Intergang have a mine in the desert. Amon is there. 
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I know it. It’s near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains. Let’s go.
Carter Hall,</b> I told you! Stop killing people!
Adam,</b> They look alive to me.
Carter Hall,</b> Because I saved them.
Adam,"</b> Well, that’s why I waited until you were there. I got the information I needed, no one died. I did it your way."
Kent Nelson,</b> He does have a point.
Carter Hall,"</b> I know it got lost in all the confusing, but we still have some issues to settle here."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> We know where Amon is. We have to go.
Carter Hall,</b> There’s no “we” here. There are only heroes and there are villains.
Adam,"</b> You think yourself a hero, but you would let these criminals go free, knowing that many more will suffer at their hands unless we end them now."
Carter Hall,</b> Heroes don’t kill people.
Adam,"</b> Well, I do."
Kent Nelson,</b> Here we go.
Carter Hall,</b> Is that what I think it is?
Carter Hall,"</b> 23 pounds of pure Eternium, much denser than typical artifacts of the period."
Al Rothstein,</b> King must have had a really strong neck.
Adam," [annoyed]</b> No, it snapped when I killed him."
Maxine Hunkel,</b> What’s that? There’s writing on the inside of the rim.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> “Life is the only path to death.”
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> That’s what it says.
Kent Nelson,"</b> Life is the only path to death. Well, that’s surprisingly obvious. Could it have another meaning?"
Al Rothstein,"</b> What if it means, like… “Life is short. You gotta hold on to what you love.”"
Carter Hall,</b> Stop.
Kent Nelson,</b> Deep.
Adam,</b> It doesn’t matter what it means. It should be buried under the ocean for eternity.
Carter Hall,</b> That’s not far from what we had in mind for you when this is over.
Adam,</b> Or I could bury you with it.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> We can’t get rid of it now. It’s the one thing that Intergang wants. Believe me, I know more than anyone what this crown is capable of. But we have to keep it until my son is safe."
Carter Hall,"</b> Adrianna… Trust me, we will get your son back."
Adam,</b> They don’t care about him. They just want to defeat me.
Carter Hall,</b> Hand it over. We can’t risk letting this crown fall into the wrong hands. We will find another way.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> No. You like to split the world into good and bad, but that’s easy to do when you’re the one drawing the line. All I care about is Amon. And until he is safe, we’re all on the same side. And you… [she gestures at both Carter and Adam] you will work together."
Carter Hall,</b> Set a course for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains. We’ll go in at dawn. [To Teth-Adam] I hope you can be a team player.
Adam,</b> I love teams.
Kent Nelson,"</b> That was sarcasm again, yes?"
Adam,</b> Very much so.
Kent Nelson,</b> Good. Just checking.
Kent Nelson,</b> A wise man once told me a bad plan is better than no plan at all.
Carter Hall,</b> That was before we had a very bad plan.
Kent Nelson,</b> Let it go. I’d rather be fighting with him than against him.
Carter Hall,"</b> He’s a murderer, Kent. If he turns on us, that kid is as good as dead."
Kent Nelson,</b> You don’t get to decide who lives or dies. That’s… up to Fate.
Carter Hall,"</b> What’s the helmet telling you? Somebody’s gonna die. Who is it, Atom Smasher? It’s Atom Smasher."
Kent Nelson,"</b> Surprisingly, no."
Carter Hall,</b> Is it me?
Kent Nelson," [with effort]</b> When it’s time for you and I to say goodbye, you’ll know. All I can tell you is… There is still time to change the future. Let’s <i>use</i> it."
Carter Hall,"</b> Well, I guess we’re sticking with a very bad plan."
Carter Hall, [v.o.]</b> The Al Hadidiyah mine is Intergang’s most valued asset.
Carter Hall,"</b> I’m gonna land us right here, cut off their access to reinforcements. But the perimeter of the mine creates a natural fortress. There is only one way in, one way out. We’ll be an easy target for their flybike patrol. Communication is key. We keep in step or we get outflanked."
Carter Hall,"</b> We move through the mine, inch by inch, until we find Amon. [To Teth-Adam] This is where you come in. Are you ready… Damn it."
Al Rothstein,</b> Or we could just do that.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Pure Eternium shield. Unbreakable, even with your powers."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Amon.
Adam,"</b> You hurt him, I will kill all of you."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.
Carter Hall,</b> We don’t have it.
Kent Nelson,"</b> Believe me, nothing good will come from that crown."
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> No crown, no negotiation."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I have it.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> It’s right here. Release my son, you can have it."
Carter Hall,</b> What do you think you’re doing?
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Intergang killed my husband. I’m not letting them take my son, too."
Adam, [to the JSA]</b> Not your son. Not your country.
Adam,</b> Not your decision to make.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> <i>Stop</i> there!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> It’s okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Hand it over, now."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> I’m sorry, Mom."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> No.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Now, let Amon go."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> I thank you. And I thank your friends for returning this crown to its rightful owner. [To Teth-Adam] What kind of Champion of Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?
Adam,</b> You have what you want. Let him go.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Ishmael, what are you doing?"
Ishmael Gregor,</b> Taking back what’s mine. I’m the last living descendant of King Ahk-Ton the Great.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> And you have just given me everything I need to become the next… king of Kahndaq.
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> My family passed the knowledge on, you know, one to the next."
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> The crown, crafted by our ancestors, stolen by the wizards and hidden away. But still a source of great power, if only we can wield it."
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> They say when Hurut died, you wept like a baby."
Ishmael Gregor,</b> I wonder if you’ll do the same for them.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Please, Ishmael."
Ishmael Gregor,"</b> Sorry, Amon."
Carter Hall,"</b> Fate, get ready."
Ishmael Gregor, [in Kahndaqi]</b> Death is the only path to life.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> AMON!!!
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Amon!
Kent Nelson,</b> He’s alive. But we need to get him to the medical bay.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Where is he shot? 
Kent Nelson,</b> It wasn’t a bullet.
Adam,</b> It was me.
Kent Nelson,</b> Come.
Maxine Hunkel,</b> We’re going with you.
Carter Hall,</b> Just find the crown. Get it on the cruiser.
Al Rothstein,</b>I found the crown. But it’s not alone.
Carter Hall,</b> How long we gonna keep doing this?
Adam,</b> There’s no point in fighting. We both know no one can stop me.
Carter Hall,</b> You’re right. Only you can. Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died. Who’s Hurut?
Adam,</b> Hurut was the true Champion of Kahndaq.
Adam,[v.o.]</b> And he was also… my son.
Adam,</b> I won’t always be here to protect you.
Hurut,</b> I don’t need protection. I want to be free.
Adam,</b> Freedom is for the birds. Let someone else be the hero… the graveyards are full of them.
Adam, [v.o.]</b> I tried to protect him. But I wasn’t strong enough.
Wizards,</b> Shazam!
Adam, [v.o.]</b> The wizards decided that he would be their champion.
Adam," [v.o.]</b> But after the Champion’s many victories, the king went after what Hurut loved the most."
Adam, [v.o.]</b> Our family.
Hurut,"</b> Hold on, Father. Stay with me."
Hurut,</b> With my powers… you’ll be safe.
Adam,</b> I couldn’t protect your mother.
Hurut,</b> Repeat what I say. Shazam. 
Adam,</b> Shazam.
Adam, [v.o.]</b> Instead of battling the king… instead of saving Kahndaq… Hurut chose to save… me.
Adam, [v.o.]</b> But he couldn’t save himself from the king’s assassins.
Adam, [v.o.]</b> The powers were not a gift from the wizards… but a curse.
Adam, [v.o.]</b> Born out of rage.
Carter Hall,</b> The statue of the Champion isn’t you. It’s Hurut.
Adam, [sorrowfully]</b> My son dreamt of a better world. That’s why he saved me. But the world was only a better place with him in it.
Adam,"</b> Kahndaq needed a hero. Instead, it got me."
Adam,"</b> All this power… And the only thing I can do with it is hurt people. I will speak the word my son gave me, and I will give up my power. And when I do, you must ensure I never speak it again."
Adam,</b> Shazam.
Adam,</b> Some men are not meant… to be heroes.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Hey.
Kent Nelson,</b> So beautiful.
Carter Hall,</b> Surprised to see us?
Emilia Harcourt,</b> Surprise is a dirty word in this business.
Kent Nelson,</b> Are you sure you can handle him?
Emilia Harcourt,"</b> You’re the one who can see the future, you’ll tell me if we can’t."
Carter Hall,</b> Just be careful with this one.
Emilia Harcourt,"</b> You know, they say the gods created us, but we’re the ones who always wind up burying them. Waller sends her regards."
Kent Nelson," [v.o.]</b> They’ll know how to deal with him. To keep him from regaining his powers, they’ll keep him in suspended animation."
Kent Nelson," [v.o.]</b> As long as he’s submerged, he won’t be able to speak. He’ll never say another word again."
Al Rothstein,</b> Hey! There he is.
Al Rothstein,"</b> Not all heroes wear capes, but I think you earned this."
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Well, statistically, most heroes don’t wear capes. But yeah, try it on."
Al Rothstein,"</b> Yeah, looks pretty good."
Al Rothstein,</b> That’s a nice touch.
Carter Hall,</b> Kent. Kent!
Carter Hall,</b> Mission accomplished?
Kent Nelson, [terrified]</b> My vision hasn’t changed.
Carter Hall,"</b> But Teth-Adam’s out of the equation. Kent, if this isn’t over, I need to know what’s coming. What is the helmet telling you?"
Kent Nelson,</b> My vision has always shown me great calamity.The world in flames. We can stop it… but you die.
Carter Hall,</b> You should’ve told me sooner. I have no fear of death.
Kent Nelson,</b> That’s precisely why I didn’t tell you. The world needs the Justice Society. The world needs you.
Carter Hall,"</b> But you can’t choose who lives and dies. That’s Fate, right?"
Kent Nelson," [chuckling]</b> Well, that sounds familiar. I remember seeing my first airplane."
Kent Nelson,"</b> It was an RAF deployment, headed to the Western Front. Everyone on my street came out to see them off. But I didn’t cheer. Even though I was only a boy.  knew where they were headed, and what awaited them. Thanks to this, [about the Helmet] I’ve lived longer than I could’ve ever have hoped for. I have seen the world change in more ways than I could’ve imagined. I’m still a sentimental fool. And I don’t want my friend to die."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> Ishmael said, “Death is the only path to life.” But that’s not what the inscription says."
Maxine Hunkel,"</b> Right. “Life is the only way to death.” Maybe he got it backwards, like he read it in a mirror or something."
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> That’s it. In Kahndaqi mythology, the souls of the damned are sent to the Rock of Finality. The underworld is a mirror to our own. Here, turn the crown around."
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Now mirror the letters.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> See? That’s what I missed. “Death... is the only path to life.”
Adrianna Tomaz," [v.o.]</b> He kidnapped Amon on purpose, because he knew that Teth-Adam would kill him. And he believed the Champion’s magic would send him to the Rock of Finality."
Belial,</b> As life is the path to death.
Aym,</b> Now your death is a path to life.
Asmodeus,"</b> The wizards have their champion, now we have ours."
Belzeebub,</b> You will take the throne of Kahndaq… and unleash hell on Earth.
Satan,</b> Speak our name.
Ishmael Gregor,</b> “Sabbac.”
Kent Nelson,</b> What the bloody hell is that?
Carter Hall,"</b> Readout says it’s the demon, Sabbac."
Kent Nelson,"</b> Get me closer. Now, right now!"
Carter Hall,"</b> We’re 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds."
Sabbac,</b> The king has returned. The throne will be mine.
Carter Hall,</b> Brace yourselves.
Carter Hall,</b> Hold on!
Sabbac,</b> Now prepare to die.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Wait, wait, where’s Uncle Karim?"
Carter Hall,"</b> No matter what happens, he does not sit on that throne."
Al Rothstein,</b> Copy that. 
Maxine Hunkel,</b> We’re on it.
Al Rothstein,</b> Heads up!
Carter Hall,</b> Activate infrared.
Carter Hall,"</b> Sabbac, show yourself!"
Karim,</b> Adrianna! Amon!
Carter Hall,</b> That’s for my cruiser.
Kent Nelson,"</b> This is it. We can’t win, Carter."
Carter Hall,"</b> Yeah, but the world burns if we don’t. Right? Bad plan is better than no plan at all."
Carter Hall,"</b> No, no, no. What are you doing?"
Kent Nelson,</b> Giving us a third option.
Carter Hall,</b> It’s supposed to be me.
Kent Nelson,"</b> I didn’t tell you my whole vision, old friend. I did see your death. But I also found a way to prevent it."
Kent Nelson,"</b> It has been an extraordinary life, but always with one foot in the future."
Kent Nelson,"</b> Carter, for the first time in 100 years,when I look ahead… I see nothing."
Carter Hall,"</b> No, Kent."
Kent Nelson,</b> And… it’s… beautiful.
Carter Hall,"</b> Wait, Kent!"
Kent Nelson,</b> Goodbye…
Carter Hall, [still hitting the barrier]</b> Kent!
Kent Nelson,</b> …my dear friend.
Carter Hall,</b> Kent! [to Al and Maxine] Hit it from every side.
Carter Hall,</b> Kent! Noooo!
Kent Nelson,"</b> I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer, agent of the Lords of Order, defender against darkness and chaos, but even my powers cannot defeat you."
Kent Nelson,</b> There is one... There is… THERE IS ONE.
Kent Nelson,</b> Teth-Adam. I know you can hear me.
Kent Nelson, [v.o.]</b>The battle your son was meant to fight is upon us. Now you are the only one who can defeat The Demon Champion.
Kent Nelson, [v.o.]</b> You have the power to be the destroyer of this world.
Kent Nelson,</b> But you can also be its savior.
Kent Nelson, [v.o.]</b> You believe you are not a worthy champion because the wizards did not choose you. But Fate does not make mistakes. Neither did your son.
 both Kent and Adam continue to fight back against their enemies in a truly inspiring tandem," separate, but united]."
Kent Nelson, [v.o.]</b> We were wrong about you. The world doesn’t always need a white knight. Sometimes it needs something darker.
Kent Nelson,</b> Don’t you dare give up on us now. The world needs you.
Carter Hall,</b> Kent!
Carter Hall,</b> NOOOO!
Amon Tomaz,</b> Mom? What’s happening?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> It’s Sabbac. He commands the Legions of Hell.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Whatever happens… you stay behind me.
Karim,"</b> ""Ooh, baby!"" [To Amon and Adriana] Don’t worry, I die by electricity."
Karim,</b> You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it! Come and get it.
Adrianna Tomaz,"</b> No, no. No."
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Don’t send me home, I can help. "
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> I know. But you can do better than swinging a stick.
Adam,</b> The Gods have brought us together again.
Hurut,"</b> It’s not your time, Father."
Amon Tomaz,</b> Hey! What are you all standing around for? This is our chance.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> With these hands, we built Kahndaq. And with these hands, we will set it free!"
Adam,</b> The people need a hero.
Hurut,"</b> No, Father. They need to be free."
Rami,</b> What are we waiting for?
Hurut,</b> Say the word.
Adam,</b> Shazam.
Carter Hall,</b> The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.
Amon Tomaz,</b> YES!
Al Rothstein,</b> I got this. Go get him.
Adam, [to Hawkman]</b> You know what I have to do.
Carter Hall,</b> Beat his ass.
Sabbac,</b> Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided by a true battle of champions.
Adam,</b> Let’s end this.
Karim,</b> It’s a lot of them.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> It’s a bit more than I thought. 
Karim,</b> Yeah. 
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Just a bit.
Amon Tomaz,"</b> Hey, mom."
Rami,</b> These are our streets. Our city!
Rami,</b> Free Kahndaq!
Sabbac,</b> The wizards’ powers were wasted on you. You are not a hero.
Adam,</b> No. I’m not.
Adam,</b> But he is.
Sabbac,</b> You cannot stand against me. I am Kahndaq’s true champion. 
Carter Hall,</b> I learned this trick from an old friend.
Carter Hall,</b> You can control it! You have to!
Adam,</b> Tell them the Man in Black sent you.
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> Yes! 
Amon Tomaz,</b> Yes!
Carter Hall,</b> I never tought I’d be happy to see you.
Adam,</b> I’m only here because of him.
Carter Hall,</b> That makes two of us.
Carter Hall,"</b> See you around, old friend."
Carter Hall,</b> Think you can keep him out of trouble?
Adrianna Tomaz,</b> As long as no one comes looking for it.
Carter Hall,</b> Fair enough. [to Teth-Adam] Just be careful. The kind of justice you dish out can darken your soul.

GIRL," Hey, Nat!"
Yelena, We’re both upside down.
Natasha, And I bet you’re gonna fall down first.
Yelena," No, you will. You can’t hold it much longer."
Natasha, Told you you’d fall down first. I told you! I told you! Told you so!
Yelena, Mommy!
Melina, What happened?
Natasha, She fell on her knee.
Melina," Oh, you bump your knee?"
Yelena, Mmm-hmm.
Melina," Oh… Kiss it better. There we go. (SHUSHING). Oh, come on, little one. Get up. You’re okay. Come on. You’re a brave girl. Your pain only makes you stronger."
Melina," Right, you?"
Natasha, Yeah.
Melina, Yeah?
Yelena, Look! Forest stars.
Melina," Yeah. You know what? Those are actually part of the Lampyridae family. And the glow, the glow that you see, that comes from a chemical reaction called… bioluminescence. Come on, time for dinner."
Yelena, Bio-goomin-feasants?
Melina," “Bio-goomin-feasants.” That’s right. Dinner! Come on, dinner, big girl!"
Yelena, I want mac and cheese.
Melina," Oh, you want mac and cheese? Okay. Well, I want… caviar and champagne. Grab the napkins. You take this. Thank you. Oh, would you grab the ranch dressing for Dad? "
Melina, Okay.
Yelena, Green beans are my favorite vegetable.
Melina, Dad’s home!
Natasha," Hey, Dad."
Alexei," Hey, baby."
Melina, Everything okay?
Melina, How was everybody’s day?
Yelena, Mommy taught me about lamp bugs.
Alexei, Lamp bugs. (CHUCKLES)
Yelena," And I fell and hurt my knee, but it doesn’t hurt anymore."
Alexei, Mmm-hmm.
YOUNG Yelena, And we also saw fireflies in the backyard. That was my favorite part of the whole day.
Melina, No.
Natasha," Yelena, we see fireflies every year."
Melina, How long do we have?
Alexei," I don’t know. Like, an hour, maybe."
Melina, I don’t wanna go.
Alexei, Don’t say that.
Alexei, Girls… you remember when I told you that one day we would have that big adventure? Today’s the day.
Yelena, Yay!
Alexei," All right, let’s go."
Melina, (WHISPERS) I’m sorry.
Melina," Come on, we gotta hurry."
Alexei, Thank you.
Yelena, I don’t have my shoes.
Alexei," Thank you, baby."
Alexei, That’s okay. You don’t need your shoes.
Yelena, But I’m still hungry.
Alexei, Yeah? Guess what? I got Fruit Roll-Ups in the car.
Melina," No, leave it, leave it, leave it. Go wait in the car."
Melina, You have it?
Alexei, Yeah.
Melina, It’s the only copy?
Alexei, It’s the only one not on fire.
Yelena, Where are we going?
Melina, Home.
Yelena," Mommy, you’re silly. We just left home."
Yelena, I want my song.
Yelena," (SINGING ALONG) ♪ Bye, bye, Miss American Pie ♪"
Yelena, ♪ Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry ♪
Yelena, ♪ Them good old boys were drinking whiskey and rye ♪
Yelena," ♪ Singing, “This’ll be the day that I die” ♪"
Yelena, ♪ “This’ll be the day that I die” ♪
Melina," Come on, Yelena. Hurry up, baby."
Melina," Let’s go. Come on, Nat. Hurry up. We gotta go. We gotta go. Come on, you gotta run."
Alexei," Come on. Honey, honey."
Alexei, Go with your mom. Go with your mom.
Natasha, Okay.
Melina," Nat, hurry up!"
Natasha, I’m coming!
Melina, Okay. Seat belts.
Natasha, Okay.
Natasha, Why isn’t Dad in the plane?
Melina," He’s coming. He’s coming, baby. He’s coming."
Natasha, Mom?
Natasha, Mom!
Melina, I need you up here.
Natasha, Okay.
Natasha, Okay.
Melina, I need you to pull right.
Natasha," Mom, you’ve got blood on you."
Natasha," (GASPS) It’s okay, baby."
Melina, Hit the accelerator there.
Melina," Hold it steady, hold it steady. You’re gonna pull back at 55 knots. Let’s count together."
Natasha AND Melina," 45, 50…"
Melina, Pull back. You can do it! Pull back. All your strength.
Alexei, Okay.
Yelena," Get up, Mommy. Pain only makes you stronger, remember?"
Dreykov, The Red Guardian returns.
Alexei," The Red Guardian returns triumphant. Please, please, I beg you. No more undercover work. I wanna get back in the action. I want my suit back. I wanna get back in it. General Dreykov, it’s been over three years."
Natasha, (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Forgive me mom. I’m scared.
Melina, (IN ENGLISH) Never let them take your heart.
Dreykov, (IN ENGLISH) Did you get it?
Dreykov, And the North Institute?
Alexei, Ashes.
Natasha, It’s gonna be okay.
Dreykov, How is Melina?
Alexei, She’ll live. She’s strong.
Yelena, Mommy? Mom?
Yelena, Daddy!
Alexei, I’ll handle this.
Yelena, Daddy! Daddy!
Natasha, Yelena!
Yelena, (SOBBING) Daddy!
Natasha, Get away from her! Don’t touch her!
Natasha, (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) I will shoot.
Natasha, (IN ENGLISH) Don’t touch her! I will kill you all!
Natasha, (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) I will shoot. Don’t touch her.
Alexei, (IN ENGLISH) Honey.
Alexei, You’re gonna need to hand me that gun.
Natasha, I don’t wanna go back there. (SOBBING) I wanna stay in Ohio. You can’t take her. (VOICE BREAKING) You can’t. She’s only six.
Alexei, You were even younger. It’s okay. Come here.
Natasha," You’re gonna be all right. Do you know why it’s gonna be all right? ‘Cause my girls are the toughest girls in the world. You’re gonna take care of each other, okay? And everything, everything’s gonna be fine."
Dreykov," That one, she has fire in her. What was her name?"
Alexei, Natasha.
Dreykov, Ah… Natasha.
Natasha, (IN ENGLISH) No!
Dreykov, (IN ENGLISH) Remove all the defects. That one and her.
Yelena, No!
Natasha, Yelena!
Natasha, Take it! Take it! No!
Yelena, (SOBBING) No!
Dreykov, The Red Room is your home now.
Natasha, Get off me! No!
TV REPORTER," Undercover spies in our communities. They took on false identities, even raised families…"
Officer, We’ve got all exits covered.
Thaddeus Ross, All right. Stay alert. I’m sending in alpha squad. Natasha Romanoff is in violation of the Sokovia Accords. She assaulted the king of Wakanda. Make an example out of her.
Thaddeus Ross, Yeah?
Natasha, Don’t do this.
Thaddeus Ross, Do what?
Natasha," Come after me. I mean, you’re embarrassing yourself. It looks desperate."
Thaddeus Ross, (ON PHONE) Thought maybe you’d be calling me to cut a deal.
Thaddeus Ross," (ON PHONE SPEAKER) ‘Cause from my vantage point, it’s the federal fugitive who’s desperate."
Natasha," From my vantage point, you look like you could use some bed rest. What is this, your second triple bypass?"
Thaddeus Ross," I wouldn’t worry about me. We got Barton, we got Wilson and that other guy, the incredible shrinking convict. Rogers is on the run. You got no friends. Where you gonna go?"
Natasha," I’ve lived a lot of lives before I met you, Ross. You shouldn’t have gone to all this trouble. I’m done."
Thaddeus Ross, Romanoff?
Officer," (IN ENGLISH) Got an empty nest, Secretary Ross. Her tracker, sir."
Yelena,  Eyes on target. Waiting for the package. 
Ingrid," I have sights on collateral one. Firing in place of three. Five, four…"
Yelena, She made us. Target deployed smoke. She’s on foot with the package. Stay high. I’m going to ground.
Yelena," (GASPS) Oksana. Oh, no. What did I do?"
OKSANA, Free the others.
Ingrid," Yelena, we need a status report."
Ingrid," (ON RADIO) Yelena, we need a status report."
Ingrid, Converge on team leader.
INGRID," (ON RADIO) General Dreykov, we have a deserter. Permission to activate Taskmaster Protocol?"
Natasha, You’re in my bed.
Rick Mason, I’m… I’m not even under the covers.
Natasha, Did you get everything on my list?
Rick Mason," Got passports, entry visas, a couple of local driver’s licenses. Mix and match, you should be able to stretch it to 20 or so identities."
Natasha, Fanny Longbottom?
Rick Mason, What?
Natasha," What, are you 12?"
Rick Mason," That is a legitimate name. (CHUCKLES) We’ve got a generator outside. It’s petrol-powered. And the septic tank will need a flush in a couple of weeks, but, you know, I’ve got a guy coming for that. You have to haul your rubbish into town. It’s just a 20-minute drive. I’ve got your basic hardware kit stashed under the stairs."
Natasha, Nice.
Rick Mason, Are you okay?
Natasha, Why wouldn’t I be?
Rick Mason," I hear things. You know, something about the Avengers getting divorced…"
Natasha, Ugh. It’s fine. I’m actually better on my own.
Rick Mason, Are you sure?
Natasha, Yeah.
Rick Mason," Because you can tell me, you know. That’s the way the whole friends thing works."
Natasha, I know. I have friends.
Rick Mason, People who have friends don’t call me.
Natasha, And I don’t pay you to worry.
Natasha," Oh, hey. What’s all this junk?"
Rick Mason," Oh, just some mail and personals from the Budapest safe house."
Natasha, Budapest?
Rick Mason, Yeah. Budapest.
Natasha," No, it’s “Budapest.”"
Rick Mason, Budapest. Budapest. It’s “Budapest.”
Rick Mason," Whatever. I knew you weren’t going back there, so I’ve got someone else in the flat now."
Natasha, Sorry you went through the trouble. I would’ve told you to chuck it.
Rick Mason," Well, if you don’t want it, throw it in the rubbish."
HUGO DRAX," You’re not a sportsman, Mr. Bond."
Natasha, (SPEAKING ALONG) Why did you break up the encounter with my pet python? Because I discovered he had a crush on me.
Movie, (ON SPEAKERS) Moonraker 1 on preset launch program…
Natasha," Oh, great."
Movie, …minus two minutes. Retract crew access…
Natasha, I’m pretty sure Ross has no jurisdiction here. And you should know I’m a better shot when I’m pissed off.
Natasha, You’re not here for me.
Natasha," Oh, shit."
Yelena, (MUFFLED) I know you’re out there.
Natasha, I know you know I’m out here.
Yelena, Then why are you skulking about like it’s a minefield?
Natasha, ‘Cause I don’t know if I can trust you.
Yelena," (CHUCKLES) Funny, I was going to say the same thing."
Natasha," So, we gonna talk like grown-ups?"
Yelena, Is that what we are?
Yelena, Put it down before I make you.
Natasha, You put yours down.
Natasha, Watch your step.
Natasha, Stay down. Stay down.
Natasha, Stay down.
Natasha, Stop. (STRAINING)
Yelena, (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Truce
Yelena, (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) You’ve grown up.
Yelena, (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) No shit.
Natasha," (IN ENGLISH) You had to come to Budapest, didn’t you?"
Yelena," I came here because I thought you wouldn’t. But since you’re here, what bullet does that?"
Natasha, Not bullets. Arrows.
Yelena," Ah, right."
Natasha," If you didn’t think I’d come here, why’d you send me this?"
Yelena, You brought it back here?
Natasha," I’m not here trying to be your friend, but you need to tell me what that is."
Yelena, It’s a synthetic gas. The counteragent to chemical subjugation. The gas immunizes the brain’s neuropathways from external manipulation.
Natasha, Maybe in English next time?
Yelena, (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) It’s an antidote to mind control. 
Natasha, Real mature.
Yelena," (IN ENGLISH) Why don’t you take it to one of your super-scientist friends? They can explain it to you. Tony Stark, maybe?"
Natasha," Oh, yeah. We’re not really talking right now, so…"
Yelena, Great. Perfect timing. Where’s an Avenger when you need one?
Natasha, I don’t wanna be here. I’m on the run. You could’ve gotten me killed.
Yelena," Well, what was I supposed to do? You’re the only superhero person that I know. That was the whole reason I sent it to you."
Yelena," I kept checking the news, expecting to see Captain America bringing down the Red Room."
Natasha, What? Taking down the Red Room? What are you talking about? It’s been gone for years. Dreykov’s dead. I killed him.
Yelena," You don’t actually believe that, do you? You really do believe that."
Natasha, Dreykov’s dead. It took almost destroying the entire city just to get to him.
Yelena," If you’re so sure, then tell me what happened. Tell me exactly."
Natasha, We rigged bombs.
Yelena, Who’s “we”?
Natasha, Clint Barton. Killing Dreykov was the final step in my defection to S.H.I.E.L.D.
Yelena, Simple as that?
Natasha," Yeah, sure, “simple.” That’s what I’d call imploding a five-story building and then shooting it out with the Hungarian Special Forces. Took 10 days in hiding before we could even get out of Budapest."
Yelena, And you checked the body? Confirmed the kill?
Natasha, There was no body left to check.
Yelena, You’re forgetting Dreykov’s daughter.
Natasha, Where are we trying to get?
Yelena, Motorbike! East side of the building.
Ingrid," (SPEAKING MACEDONIAN) Copy, in pursuit."
Ingrid, (IN ENGLISH) I got you!
Natasha, No!
Natasha, Hey. Don’t move. You’re hurt. Let me help you.
Ingrid, I don’t wanna do this. (SOBBING)
Natasha, What are you doing?
Ingrid, He’s making me.
Yelena, Do you believe me now?
Natasha, How many others?
Yelena, Enough.
Natasha, Which one’s yours?
Yelena, Black. Brown seat. Where are my keys?
Natasha," (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) …ah, bitch."
Yelena, (IN ENGLISH) Any day now.
Driver, (SPEAKING HUNGARIAN) Are you ok?
Yelena, (SPEAKING HUNGARIAN) Fantastic.
Natasha, (IN ENGLISH) You can’t just steal a guy’s car.
Yelena, So you want me to chase him down and un-steal it?
Yelena," Okay. Any time now, please."
Natasha, Shut up.
Yelena," Okay, you got a plan, or shall I just stay duck-and-cover?"
Natasha," Yeah, my plan was to drive us away."
Yelena, That’s a shit plan.
Yelena, You’re welcome.
Yelena," Oh, shit. He’s back."
Natasha, Put your seat belt on.
Yelena, You’re such a mom.
Yelena," Natasha, no. I think I’m bleeding. I’m…"
Natasha," No. Not now, trust me."
Natasha, You okay?
Yelena, Yeah. Great plan. I love the part where I almost bled to death. This is cozy.
Natasha, Barton and I spent two days hiding out up here.
Yelena, That must have been fun.
Natasha, Who the hell is that guy?
Yelena, Dreykov’s special project. He can mimic anyone he’s ever seen. It’s like fighting a mirror. Dreykov only deploys him for top-priority missions.
Natasha, This doesn’t make any sense.
Yelena," Well, the truth rarely makes sense when you omit key details."
Natasha, What is that supposed to mean?
Yelena, You didn’t say one word about Dreykov’s daughter. You killed her.
Natasha, I had to. I needed her to lead me to Dreykov.
BARTON, (ON RADIO) We need confirmation Dreykov’s in the building.
Natasha, His car is pulling up now.
Natasha, Dreykov’s daughter was collateral damage. I needed her to be sure.
BARTON," (ON RADIO) Natasha, we clear?"
Natasha, All clear.
Yelena," And here you are, not so sure."
Natasha, (SIGHS) I needed out.
Natasha, The Red Room’s still active. Where is it?
Yelena, I have no idea. He moves location constantly. And every widow is sedated on entry and exit for maximum security.
Natasha, I’m just finding it hard to believe that he could stay off my radar.
Yelena," Well, it’s not smart to attack an Avenger if you want to stay hidden. I mean, the clue is in the name. Dreykov kills you, one of the big ones comes to avenge you."
Natasha," Wait, what are the big ones?"
Yelena," Well, I doubt the god from space has to take an ibuprofen after a fight. Where did you think I was all this time?"
Natasha, I thought that you got out and were living a normal life.
Yelena, And you just never made contact again?
Natasha," Honestly, I thought you didn’t wanna see me."
Yelena," (SCOFFS) Bullshit. You just didn’t want your baby sister to tag along, whilst you saved the world with the cool kids."
Natasha, You weren’t really my sister.
Yelena, And the Avengers aren’t really your family. Why do you always do that thing?
Natasha, Do what?
Yelena," The thing you do when you’re fighting. The… Like, the… This thing that you do when you whip your hair when you’re fighting with the arm and the hair. And you do, like, a fighting pose. (LAUGHS) It’s a… (LAUGHS) It’s a fighting pose. You’re a total poser."
Natasha, I’m not a poser.
Yelena," (LAUGHS) Oh, come on. I mean, they’re great poses, but it does look like you think everyone’s looking at you, like, all the time."
Natasha," All that time that I spent posing, I was trying to actually do something good to make up for all the pain and suffering that we caused. Trying to be more than just a trained killer."
Yelena," Well, then you were fooling yourself because pain and suffering is every day and we are both still a trained killer. Except I’m not the one that’s on the cover of a magazine. I’m not the killer that little girls call their hero."
Yelena," That gas, the counteragent, it was synthesized in secret by an older widow from Melina’s generation. I was on the mission to retrieve it, and she exposed me and I killed the widow that freed me."
Natasha, Did you have a choice?
Yelena," What you experienced was psychological conditioning. I’m talking about chemically altering brain functions. They’re two completely different things. You’re fully conscious, but you don’t know which part is you. I’m still not sure."
Natasha, Is that all there is left?
Yelena, Mmm-hmm. It’s the only thing that can stop Dreykov and his network of widows.
Yelena," He takes more every day. Children who don’t have anyone to protect them. Just like us when we were small. Maybe one in 20 survives the training, becomes a widow. The rest, he kills. To him, we are just things. Weapons with no face that he can just throw away. Because there is always more. And no one’s even looking for him, thanks to you and Alexei."
Natasha, Alexei?
Yelena, “Dad.”
Yelena, Did you ever look for your parents? Your real ones?
Natasha," Well, my mom abandoned me in the street like garbage. What about you?"
Yelena," They destroyed my birth certificate, so I reinvented it. My parents still live in Ohio. My sister moved out west."
Natasha, Is that right?
Yelena," You’re a science teacher. You’re working part-time, though, especially after you had your son. Your husband, he renovates houses."
Natasha, That is not my story.
Yelena, (LAUGHS) What is your story?
Natasha, I never let myself be alone long enough to think about it.
Yelena, Did you ever wish for kids? I want a dog.
Natasha, Where you gonna go?
Yelena," I don’t know. I don’t really have anywhere to go back to, so I guess anywhere."
Yelena, Don’t.
Natasha, Don’t what?
Yelena," (CHUCKLES) You’re going to give me some big hero speech, I can feel it."
Natasha, Speeches aren’t really my thing.
Yelena, Huh.
Natasha, It was more like an invitation.
Yelena, To go to the Red Room and kill Dreykov?
Natasha, Yeah.
Yelena, Even though the Red Room is impossible to find and Dreykov is too slippery to kill?
Natasha, Yeah.
Yelena, That sounds like a shitload of work.
Natasha," Yup. (SIGHS) Could be fun, though."
Yelena, Yup.
Natasha, I saw where he put the keys.
Yelena," Top drawer, green cabinet."
Yelena," You know, this is the first piece of clothing I’ve ever bought for myself."
Natasha, That?
Yelena, Yeah. You don’t like it?
Natasha," Is that like a… Is it army surplus, or…"
Yelena," Okay, it has a lot of pockets."
Yelena," But I use them all the time, and I made some of my own modifications. (SCOFFS)"
Natasha," Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS)"
Yelena," Whatever. Shut up. The point is, I’ve never… I’ve never had control over my own life before, and now I do. I want to do things."
Natasha, Hmm… I like your vest.
Yelena," I knew it. I knew you did. It’s so cool, right?"
Natasha, It’s good. Yes. I like it.
Yelena," And you can put so much stuff in there. You wouldn’t even know. I really don’t know where the Red Room is, though. I’m sorry."
Natasha, I know. But I think I know somebody who does.
Yelena," Oh, yeah? Who?"
Natasha, We’re gonna need a jet.
Natasha, I said we needed a jet.
Rick Mason," Yeah, you know what you didn’t give me? Time. Or money. I’m not made of jets."
Yelena, I thought you were supposed to be the best. Like a real pro.
Rick Mason," Oh, I beg your pardon, tsarina. Was the free flat and lifetime supply of kissel not to your liking?"
Yelena, Ha!
Natasha, Don’t let her wind you up.
Rick Mason," No, I take exception to impugning my professionalism."
Natasha," Well, you did set me up with a generator that crapped out after six hours."
Rick Mason," (SCOFFS) You, too, huh? Tag team."
Yelena," Aw, he’s sensitive. See why you keep him around."
Natasha, Where’s the rest?
Rick Mason, Voilà.
Yelena, Ooh.
Natasha," Oh, I stashed that, like, five years ago."
Natasha, How is it?
Yelena, It’s dry. It’s really dry.
Rick Mason," You know, you’re getting dangerously close to running out your tab. Supplies I can tally, but you bring me attention from the authorities, all my prices go up."
Natasha, What’s that supposed to mean?
Rick Mason," Your mate, Secretary Ross, has been sniffing around my affairs to the point at which I’ve got contacts declining my calls. I’m a private contractor."
Natasha, You are sensitive.
Rick Mason, You’re a very annoying individual.
Natasha, I’ll make it up to you.
Rick Mason, Mmm-hmm. That’s what you say every time.
Alexei," So, I have the nuclear code."
Alexei, But there he is.
Alexei, Captain America!
INMATES, America.
Alexei," Finally, the Red Guardian’s time has come!"
Alexei," I grab hold of his shield and face to face, it’s a test of strength."
Alexei," Oh… Oh, no."
Alexei, (GRUNTS) Oh…
Alexei, That guy think he going to beat me.
Alexei," Anyway, this shield, you know, that he carries with him like a precious baby blanket, you know?"
Alexei, I use it to my advantage. I take it and I push him out the window.
Alexei, And I make my escape. Huh?
Alexei," I don’t know. Like, ’83, ’84."
Alexei, I know.
Alexei," Are you calling me a liar, Ursa, huh?"
Alexei," (IN ENGLISH) Oh, no."
Alexei, Uh-oh.
Alexei," (IN ENGLISH) Aw, look at the big bear."
Alexei," Gonna cry, little girl?"
Natasha," (IN ENGLISH) Today is your lucky day, Alexei."
Natasha, Move to the door on the south wall.
Natasha, Go left.
Natasha, Just don’t make a scene.
Natasha," (IN ENGLISH) You made a scene, didn’t you?"
Alexei, (GRUNTS) What now?
Natasha, (ON RADIO) We’re gettin’ you outta here.
Natasha, (IN ENGLISH) Go to the upper level.
Natasha," Move your ass, super soldier."
Yelena, He’s never going to make it.
Natasha, Get me closer.
Natasha, You got a better idea?
Alexei, Natasha.
Yelena, Such a poser.
Natasha, (GRUNTS) Seriously?
Yelena, Whoo!
Yelena, Sorry!
Natasha, What are you doing? Are you kidding me?
Natasha, Back up!
Yelena, We’re both doing a really good job.
Yelena, No.
Yelena, Okay. Enough of this.
Yelena, Ha!
Yelena, Whoa…
Yelena, This would be a cool way to die.
Alexei, Tell me that’s a good sign for us!
Natasha, Move your ass!
Natasha, Get us outta here!
Alexei, Huh.
Alexei, Wait!
Yelena, (SIGHS) Yes!
Yelena, I need some help up here!
Alexei," (SHOUTING IN RUSSIAN) Goodbye, douchebags!"
Alexei," (IN ENGLISH) Oh, that was exciting."
Alexei," Oh, I’m so proud of you girls."
Alexei," (LOUDLY) Oh, you can’t hear me, huh?"
Alexei, (LAUGHING) Okay.
Alexei, Ah… (CHUCKLING)
Alexei, Wow.
Alexei, (GROANS) Okay.
Alexei," Why the aggression, huh?"
Alexei, Is it your time of the month?
Yelena," I don’t get my period, dipshit. I don’t have a uterus."
Natasha, Or ovaries.
Yelena, Yeah. That’s what happens when the Red Room gives you an involuntary hysterectomy.
Yelena, They kind of just go in and they rip out all of your reproductive organs.
Yelena, They just get right in there and they chop them all away.
Yelena," Everything out, so you can’t have babies."
Alexei," Okay, okay. Okay! Okay!"
Alexei, You don’t have to get so clinical and nasty.
Yelena," Oh, well, I was about to talk about fallopian tubes, but okay."
Alexei, No.
Alexei, It means so much to me that you came back for me.
Natasha, No. No. You’re gonna tell us how to get to the Red Room.
Alexei, Huh.
Alexei," Whoa, look at you, huh? All business."
Natasha," Trust me, this isn’t pleasure."
Alexei," Little Natasha, all indoctrinated into the Western agenda."
Natasha, I chose to go west to become an Avenger.
Natasha, ‘Cause they treated me like family.
Alexei, Really? Family?
Alexei," Well, where are they now?"
Alexei, Where is that family now?
Natasha, Tell me where the Red Room is.
Alexei, I have no idea.
Alexei, Okay?
Natasha, Come on. You and Dreykov were like…
Alexei, Dreykov?
Natasha, Yeah.
Alexei," General Dreykov, my friend, huh?"
Alexei, Gives me glory…
Alexei," Soviet Union’s first and only super soldier. I could have been more famous than Captain America. Then he buries me in Ohio on that stupid mission. Three years! So tedious, boring me to tears. No offense, huh? Then puts me in prison for the rest of my life. Why, huh? Why? Why would he put me in… You know why? ‘Cause maybe I want to talk about the withering of the state. Or maybe I don’t like his hair or something and I say something casually about that. Maybe, you know, I want the Party to feel actually like a party instead of this sourpuss organization. But instead, no. He puts me in prison for the rest of my life. He just runs off and hides, huh? I’m not even the one who, uh, you know… I’m not the one who killed his daughter."
Yelena, (SPEAKS RUSSIAN) Great! 
Yelena, (IN ENGLISH) Can we throw him out the window now?
Natasha, I think we should wait till we get to a higher altitude.
Yelena, All right.
Alexei, (SPEAKING RUSSIAN) Why not ask Melina where it is?
Yelena," (IN ENGLISH) Wait, Mom Melina?"
Natasha, We thought she was dead.
Alexei, You cannot kill a fox that swift.
Natasha, Ew.
Alexei, What?
Alexei," She was the scientist, the strategist. I was the muscle. She worked directly for Dreykov far more than I ever did."
Natasha, Wait. Are you telling me that Melina is working for the Red Room present day?
Alexei, She works remotely outside St. Petersburg.
Yelena, (SCOFFS) Uh…
Yelena, I don’t think we have enough fuel for St. Petersburg.
Alexei," No, we’re good. We’ll make it."
Yelena, Okay.
Alexei, You should’ve brought the Avengers’ superjet.
Yelena," I swear, if I hear one more word from him, I will kick him in the face."
Natasha, (SOFTLY) He’s the worst.
Alexei," Natasha. Natasha. Natasha. Come here, I want to ask you something. Come, it’s important."
Natasha, What?
Alexei, Did he talk to you about me?
Natasha, What?
Alexei," Did he talk to you about me? You know, trading war stories?"
Natasha, Who? What are you talking about?
Alexei," Captain America. My great adversary in this theater of geopolitical conflict. Not so much a nemesis. More like a contemporary, you know? Coequal. I always thought there was a great deal of mutual respect…"
Natasha, Wait. You haven’t seen either one of us in 20 years and you’re gonna ask me about you?
Alexei, What is with this tension? Did I do something wrong?
Yelena, Is that a serious question?
Alexei," I only ever loved you girls. I did my best to make sure you would succeed to achieve your fullest potential, and everything worked out."
Natasha, Everything worked out?
Alexei," Yes. For you, yes. We accomplished our mission in Ohio. Yelena, you went on to become the greatest child assassin the world has ever known. No one can match your efficiency, your ruthlessness. And Natasha, not just a spy, not just toppling regimes, destroying empires from within, but an Avenger. You both have killed so many people. Your ledgers must be dripping, just gushing red. I couldn’t be more proud of you."
Yelena, Okay. You can… No. Let go of me now. You smell really bad.
Yelena," So, are we there yet?"
Alexei, You’ll know when we’re there.
Melina," Slight right. Straight on. Right. Slight right. Oh, very good, my darling."
Melina," Yes, very good. Yes, very good, my darling."
Melina, Back home where it’s safe. Come on. Go on.
Alexei," Honey, we’re home. Come on, girls."
Melina, Welcome to my humble abode. Make yourself at home. Let’s have a drink. (SIGHS)
Natasha," Hey, no funny business."
Melina, I am putting away my weapon.
Natasha, Are there any booby traps around here? Anything we need to know about?
Melina, I didn’t raise my girls to fall in traps.
Natasha, You didn’t raise us at all.
Melina," Oh, maybe so. But if you got soft, it wasn’t on my watch."
Melina, Let’s drink.
Alexei, Okay.
Alexei, Still fits.
Yelena," Oh, my God."
Melina, I never washed it once. Come and drink. 
Alexei," (SINGING) Rise, you workers of salvation. (SCATTING) Family back together again. Mmm."
Melina," Seeing as our family construct was just a calculated ruse that only lasted three years, I don’t think that we can use this term anymore, can we?"
Natasha," Agreed. So, here’s what’s gonna happen…"
Alexei," Okay. A reunion then, huh? And, uh… I want to say something right off the bat. You haven’t aged a day, huh? You’re just as beautiful and as supple as the day they staged our marriage."
Melina, You got fat. But still good.
Alexei," (Alexei CHUCKLES) I just got out of prison. I, uh… I have a lot of energy."
Melina, Oh!
Natasha," Please don’t do that. So, here’s what’s gonna happen."
Melina," Natasha, don’t slouch."
Natasha, I’m not slouching.
Melina," Yes, yes, you are."
Natasha, I don’t slouch.
Melina, You’re going to get a back hunch.
Alexei, Listen to your mother.
Natasha," Oh, my God, this…"
Alexei," Up, up."
Natasha," All right, enough. All of you."
Yelena, I didn’t say anything. That’s not fair.
Natasha, Here’s what’s gonna happen…
Yelena, I don’t want any food.
Melina," Eat a little something, Yelena, for God’s sake."
Natasha, You’re gonna tell us the location of the Red Room.
Melina," You know, it’s like when you told them that they could stay up late to catch Santa Claus."
Alexei," What? That was fun. You know, “He come down the chimney, girls. Look out. Where is he?” You wait for him, and then when the cookies are gone, then you see he’s there. No, no. What? I want them to follow their dreams."
Melina, No good.
Alexei," Reach for the stars, girls."
Natasha, Finding Dreykov is not a fantasy. It’s unfinished business.
Melina, You can’t defeat a man who commands the very will of others. You never saw the culmination of what we started in America. Nor did you.
Alexei," Natasha, always focus, focus. Get what you want."
Melina, Come in.
Natasha, Did that pig just open the door?
Melina," Yes. It did. Good boy, Alexei. Good boy."
Alexei, You named a pig after me?
Melina," You don’t see the resemblance? See, he sits just like dog. Amazing. Now, watch."
Alexei," It’s a little weird, to me."
Melina, Stop breathing.
Melina," We infiltrated the North Institute in Ohio. It was a front for S.H.I.E.L.D. scientists. Actually, it was Hydra scientists at that time. In conjunction with the Winter Soldier project, they had dissected and deconstructed the human brain to create the first and only cellular blueprint of the basal ganglia. Was the hub for cognition. Voluntary motor movement, procedural learning. We didn’t steal weaponry or technology. We stole the key to unlocking free will."
Natasha, What are you doing?
Melina," Oh, I am explaining that the science is now so exact, the subject can be instructed to stop breathing and has no choice but to obey."
Natasha," Okay, you made your point. That’s enough."
Melina," Yes, all right. Well, don’t worry, Alexei could’ve survived 11 more seconds without oxygen. Good boy. Now, you go back, back home where it’s safe."
Melina," You go. You go back home, back home where it’s safe. Good boy, Alexei. The world functions on a higher level when it is controlled. Dreykov has chemically subjugated agents planted around the globe."
Yelena, And do you know who they test it on?
Melina, Hmm… No. That’s not my department.
Alexei," Ah, come on, come on. Don’t lie to them. Hmm?"
Melina, I’m not lying.
Alexei," You’re Dreykov’s architect, huh?"
Melina," What were you? If I was his architect, you were his partner. You were his business partner."
Alexei," No, no, no. I was patsy! (BANGS TABLE)"
Melina, Don’t give me that…
Alexei, He sell me ideology.
Melina, Stop with the politics.
Alexei," All the while, bigger…"
Natasha," Shut up! You are an idiot. And you’re a coward. You’re a coward. And our family was never real, so there’s nothing to hold on to. We’re moving on."
Alexei," Never family, huh? In my heart, I am simple man. And I think that for a couple deep undercover Russian agents I think we did pretty great as parents, huh? Yes, we had our orders, and we played our roles to perfection."
Natasha, Who cares? That wasn’t real.
Yelena, What?
Natasha, That wasn’t real. Who cares?
Yelena, Don’t say that. Please don’t say that. It was real. It was real to me. You are my mother. You were my real mother. The closest thing I ever had to one. The best part of my life was fake.
Yelena, And none of you told me.
Yelena," And those agents you chemically subjugated around the globe? That was me. Mmm. And you, you got out. Dreykov made sure no one could escape. Are you gonna say anything? No. Don’t touch me."
Natasha, Yelena.
Yelena, No.
Melina, I had no idea.
Alexei," It’s okay, it’s okay. I’ll go talk to her."
Yelena, I came in here because I didn’t want to talk.
Alexei," Okay. We, uh… We just sit. We just sit."
Melina, Where are you going?
Natasha, To do this myself.
Melina, Don’t. You won’t survive.
Natasha, I wish I could believe that you cared. But you’re not even the first mother that abandoned me.
Melina," No, you weren’t abandoned. You were selected by a program that assessed the genetic potential in infants."
Natasha, I was taken?
