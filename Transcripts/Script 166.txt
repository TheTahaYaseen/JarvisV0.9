Inside a snowflake,
like the one on your sleeve...
<br/>
there happened a story
you must see to believe.
<br/>
Way up in the mountains,
in the high range of Pontoos...
<br/>
lay the small town of Whoville:
<br/>
The home of the Whos.
<br/>
Ask any Who,
and they'll have this to say:
<br/>
"There is no place like Whoville
around Christmas Day."
<br/>
Every window was flocked,
every lamppost was dressed...
<br/>
and the Whoville band marched
in their Christmas-y best.
<br/>
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Arbor Day was fine,
and Easter was pleasant...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and every Saint Fizzin's day,
they ate a Fizz pheasant.
<br/>
But every Who knew,
from their twelve toes to their snout...
<br/>
they loved Christmas the most,
without a single Who doubt.
<br/>

<br/>
Hello, Myrna. Merry Christmas, Fred.
Excuse me.
<br/>
Cindy Lou? Honey?
<br/>
- Dad?
- Yeah?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't this seem like a bit much?
<br/>
This is what Christmas is all about!
<br/>
Can't you feel it?
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Thank you for shopping Farfingle's.
Wait a second!
<br/>
Your change!
<br/>
Another minute closer to Christmas!
<br/>
And, for the next five minutes only,
99 percent off!
<br/>
Yes, every Who down in Whoville
liked Christmas a lot...
<br/>
but the Grinch,
who lived just north of Whoville...
<br/>
did not.
<br/>
Get on it, girls.
All the good mistletoe's at the top.
<br/>
- Hey, Drew, I'll race you!
- Not if I race you first.
<br/>
Last one to the top
is a stinky old Grinch!
<br/>
You guys, where are we?
I think we should go back.
<br/>
What? You're scared of the Grinch!
<br/>
No!
<br/>
They say he lives up here in a big cave.
<br/>
And only comes down
when he's hungry for the taste of...
<br/>
- Who flesh!
- Drew!
<br/>
You're scared of the Grinch!
You're scared of the Grinch!
<br/>
- Are too!
- Am not!
<br/>
Wait for me!
<br/>
Go on, touch it. Touch the door.
<br/>
Do it for me, Stu.
<br/>
Well done, Max!
<br/>
Serves them right,
those Yuletide-loving...
<br/>
sickly-sweet, nog-sucking cheer mongers!
<br/>
I really don't like them.
<br/>
No, I don't.
<br/>
Max!
<br/>
Get my cloak!
<br/>
I've been much too tolerant
of these Whovenile delinquents...
<br/>
and their innocent, victimless pranks.
<br/>
So, they want to get
to know me, do they?
<br/>
They want to spend a little quality time
with the Grinch.
<br/>
I guess I could use a little...
<br/>
social interaction.
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Yeah, you bet.
<br/>
Ho, ho, ho, and stuff.
<br/>
Oh, my.
<br/>
Someone has vandalized that vehicle.
<br/>
You see, Max?
The city is a dangerous place.
<br/>
The Grinch hated Christmas.
The whole Christmas season.
<br/>
Top of the day. Flatfoot.
<br/>
Now, please, don't ask why.
No one quite knows the reason.
<br/>
Here's a present for you.
<br/>
Be sure to run real fast with it.
Come on. Double time. Move.
<br/>
It could be that his head
wasn't screwed on just right.
<br/>
Or it could be, perhaps,
that his shoes were too tight.
<br/>
But I think that
the most likely reason of all...
<br/>
may have been that his heart
was two sizes too small.
<br/>
Stranger, won't let you go
till you buy a chapeau!
<br/>
Boy, nothing beats Christmas, right?
<br/>
I guess.
<br/>
You guess?
<br/>
It's just, I look around at you and Mom
and everyone getting all kerbobbled.
<br/>
Doesn't this seem superfluous?
<br/>
Dad!
<br/>
Dad!
<br/>
- What happened to you?
- It was the Grinch!
<br/>
- Grinch?
- What do you want? I mean...
<br/>
"Grinch? Oh, no!"
<br/>
Did someone just say, "Grinch"?
<br/>
Hello, Mayor May-Who, sir.
<br/>
Lou.
<br/>
I don't need to remind you
that this Christmas...
<br/>
marks the one thousandth Whobilation.
<br/>
Whoville's most important celebration!
<br/>
And The Book of Who says, very clearly:
<br/>
"Every size of Who we can measure...
<br/>
"knows that Whobilation
is a time we must treasure."
<br/>
Now, Lou, please tell me
that your boys...
<br/>
were not up on Mount Crumpit...
<br/>
provoking the one creature
within a billion bilometers of here...
<br/>
who hates Christmas!
<br/>
But it was the Grinch!
<br/>
No, sir, the boys didn't see any Grinch.
<br/>
It was, and he came after...
<br/>
I think they were up on the mountain...
<br/>
playing with matches,
or defacing public property, or...
<br/>
That's a relief.
<br/>
All right, you heard the man:
<br/>
There is no Grinch problem here.
<br/>
- I need it there by tomorrow.
- Heck of a rush.
<br/>
Merry Christmas, Mo. Heck of a rush.
<br/>
But, Dad...
<br/>
I just don't understand something.
<br/>
Why won't anyone talk about the Grinch?
<br/>
You kids and the Grinch!
<br/>
You see, Cindy,
the Grinch is a Who, who always...
<br/>
Actually, not a Who. He's more of a...
<br/>
- A what?
- Exactly, honey.
<br/>
And he's a What
who doesn't like Christmas.
<br/>
Take a look at his mailbox, sweetie.
<br/>
Not a single Christmas card, in or out.
<br/>
Ever!
<br/>
But why?
<br/>
Lou, where's my mail?
<br/>
Lou! Got the wrong mail here.
<br/>
Lou! I got the wrong mail!
<br/>
- I'll be right there.
- Lou, we got a problem!
<br/>
All right, we'll straighten this out.
<br/>
It'll take them years to sort this out.
<br/>
This is his and now it's yours,
and this hers and now it's his!
<br/>
And for the rest of you:
<br/>
Jury duty! Jury duty! Jury duty!
<br/>
Blackmail. Pink slip.
Chain letter. Eviction notice.
<br/>
Jury duty!
<br/>
Would you mind helping me
take this to the back room, honey?
<br/>
- Be careful of the sorting machine, right?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Gesundheit.
<br/>
You're the...
<br/>
The...
<br/>
The Grinch!
<br/>
That worked out nicely.
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
Help me! Somebody!
<br/>
Max, let's go.
<br/>
Our work here is finished.
<br/>
Help me!
<br/>
Please help!
<br/>
That is not a chew toy!
<br/>
Stop it, Max!
<br/>
Get that out of your mouth!
You have no idea where it's been!
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
Bleeding hearts of the world, unite!
<br/>
There! Give me that!
<br/>
Don't you know you shouldn't
take things that don't belong to you?
<br/>
What's your problem?
Are you a wild animal?
<br/>
Let's go.
<br/>
Thanks for saving me.
<br/>
Saving you?
<br/>
Is that what you think I was doing?
<br/>
Wrong-o.
<br/>
I merely noticed that you were
improperly packaged, my dear.
<br/>
Hold still!
<br/>
Max, pick out a bow.
<br/>
Can I use your finger for a second?
<br/>
Hello! Hello!
<br/>
- Cindy?
- Dad!
<br/>
Daddy!
<br/>
Daddy!
<br/>
What the hey...?
<br/>
Honey.
<br/>
Cindy?
<br/>
Dad! It was amazing!
<br/>
You've been practicing
your Christmas wrapping!
<br/>
I am so proud of you.
<br/>
Now, that's holiday.
<br/>
Sweet little Cindy
didn't know what to do.
<br/>
In her head, bum-tumbled
a conflict or two.
<br/>
"If the Grinch was so bad,
then why did he save me?
<br/>
"Maybe he wasn't so bad."
<br/>
Maybe. Just maybe.
<br/>
No lights on in the house.
Your mom must be shopping.
<br/>
Good, I'm so glad you're home.
<br/>
I can feel it, Lou. This is the year.
<br/>
When everybody asks who has the most
spectacular lights in greater Whoville...
<br/>
they're gonna cry out,
"Mrs. Betty Lou Who!"
<br/>
Isn't this the chandelier
from the dining room?
<br/>
It's all for the cause, dear.
<br/>
And Cindy?
Could you be Mommy's little helper...
<br/>
and unscrew the bulb there
from the refrigerator?
<br/>
- 'Cause somehow I missed that one.
- Go on!
<br/>
Every year Martha May Whovier
has the best lights.
<br/>
Not this year.
<br/>
This year...
<br/>
I'm gonna beat
that prim, perfect little prissy...
<br/>
Betty!
<br/>
- Hi!
- Martha!
<br/>
My, I've never seen so many
beautiful Christmas lights, Betty Lou!
<br/>
I'd blow every fuse if I tried
to keep up with you, Martha May!
<br/>
Isn't this antique darling?
<br/>
It's handcrafted
and almost 100 years old.
<br/>
Jeez. I'm really impressed!
<br/>
This, however, is new.
<br/>
Betty! Sweetie!
<br/>
Good night, Betty.
<br/>
- I got it!
- Honey, I've got it.
<br/>
Hello?
<br/>
Is my sub-zero chillibrator running?
<br/>
- I suppose.
- You better go catch it!
<br/>
That's a good one! That is rich.
<br/>
Let's go home.
<br/>
Fleas before beauty. Thank you.
<br/>
Come on, hurry up, Slowpoke.
<br/>
There's got to be a better way!
<br/>
A car would have paid for itself by now!
<br/>
Goody. Another load coming down.
<br/>
What's that stench?
<br/>
It's fantastic!
<br/>
Max! Grab a bag.
<br/>
We'll come back for the rest.
<br/>
Of course, when I say "we,"
I mean "you."
<br/>
It's amazing
what these Whos just throw away.
<br/>
Oh, well.
<br/>
One man's toxic sludge
is another man's potpourri.
<br/>
I don't know. It's some kind of soap.
<br/>
"Where are you, Christmas?
<br/>
"Why can't I find you?
<br/>
"Why have you gone away?
<br/>
"My world is changing
<br/>
"I'm rearranging
<br/>
"Does that mean Christmas
<br/>
"changes too?
<br/>
"Where are you, Christmas?
<br/>
"Do you remember
<br/>
"The girl you used to know?
<br/>
"You and I were so carefree
<br/>
"Now nothing's easy
<br/>
"Did Christmas change
<br/>
"Or just
<br/>
"me?"
<br/>
Sweet!
<br/>
"Be it ever so
<br/>
"Heinous
<br/>
"There's no place like home"
<br/>
First floor, factory rejects.
<br/>
Those Whos are hard to frazzle, Max!
<br/>
But we did our worst.
And that's all that matters.
<br/>
At least I scared the bejeebles
out of that little girl at the post office.
<br/>
She'll be scarred for life,
if we're lucky.
<br/>
Funny she didn't rat on us, though.
<br/>
Must be afraid of reprisals.
<br/>
Yes!
<br/>
Down a size and a half!
<br/>
And this time, I'll keep it off.
<br/>
Get the stick, Max. Get the stick!
<br/>
There's no stick!
<br/>
I'm smarter.
<br/>
Any calls?
<br/>
You have no messages.
<br/>
Odd. Better check the outgoing.
<br/>
If you utter so much as one syllable...
<br/>
I'll hunt you down
and gut you like a fish!
<br/>
If you'd like to fax me,
press the star key.
<br/>
Oh, well.
<br/>
That's more like it.
<br/>
Excellent year.
<br/>
I'll tell you, Max...
<br/>
I don't know
why I ever leave this place.
<br/>
I've got all the company
I need right here.
<br/>
Hello!
<br/>
Hello!
<br/>
How are you?
<br/>
How are you?
<br/>
I asked you first.
<br/>
I asked you first.
<br/>
That's really mature,
saying exactly what I say!
<br/>
Mature... exactly... what I say...
<br/>
I'm an idiot!
<br/>
You're an idiot!
<br/>
All right, fine.
<br/>
I'm not talking to you anymore.
In fact, I'm going to whisper.
<br/>
So that by the time my voice reverberates
off the walls and gets back to me...
<br/>
I won't be able to hear it!
<br/>
You're an idiot!
<br/>
Am I just eating because I'm bored?
<br/>
Who could that be?
<br/>
Hello, little girl.
Are you here to read to us?
<br/>
No.
<br/>
I hear you know some things
about the Grinch.
<br/>
Cindy Lou had some questions
in her curious heart.
<br/>
Why did the Grinch hate Christmas?
Where did it all start?
<br/>
With her dad's blabbacorder
she wouldn't give an inch.
<br/>
In your own words, please tell me
everything you know about the Grinch.
<br/>
Where did he come from?
<br/>
He came the way all Who babies come.
<br/>
On calm nights...
<br/>
baby Who girls and tiny Who fellas...
<br/>
drift from the sky
in their own pumbersellas.
<br/>
Hey, honey, our baby is here!
<br/>
He looks just like your boss.
<br/>
So that's how it works.
<br/>
It was Christmas Eve,
and a strange wind blew that night.
<br/>
We were having
our annual holiday get-together.
<br/>
It was morning before anybody realized
that he was out there!
<br/>
The poor dear!
<br/>
But, you know what?
<br/>
We knew right away that he was special.
<br/>
Do you want a Christmas cookie?
<br/>
Yes, which Christmas cookie
would you like?
<br/>
Santa.
<br/>
His first words!
<br/>
Yes, that is a Santa plate.
<br/>
Do you want to hold this Santa plate?
<br/>
Santa, bye-bye!
<br/>
He was a wonderful...
<br/>
whatever he was.
<br/>
And we raised him
like any other Who child:
<br/>
With a deep love of Christmas.
<br/>
Don't forget, tomorrow
is our big Christmas gift exchange.
<br/>
Everyone bring a special gift
for a special someone.
<br/>
The...
<br/>
Grinch...
<br/>
He had no sense of color coordination.
<br/>
Although I hardly remember him.
I didn't have time to socialize.
<br/>
I was far too busy with my...
<br/>
studies.
<br/>
Now, class, is everyone almost finished?
<br/>
And if the truth be told, he...
<br/>
He liked Martha.
<br/>
Martha was my girlfriend.
<br/>
I don't like discussing this Grinch
so very close to Christmas, but...
<br/>
maybe if you hear the truth,
you'll understand why...
<br/>
Put your back into it!
<br/>
I tried to take him under my wing.
<br/>
You don't have a chance with her.
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!
<br/>
He had hair. Not pleasant.
<br/>
He shed.
<br/>
Not right.
<br/>
You know, Christmas
is my favorite time of year.
<br/>
I just love the colors.
<br/>
The red...
<br/>
and the green.
<br/>
Did I have a crush on the Grinch?
<br/>
Of course not.
<br/>
I didn't ask you that.
<br/>
Right.
<br/>
For some reason,
when he came home that day...
<br/>
he really got into the Christmas spirit
for the first time.
<br/>
Perfect!
<br/>
Whoopsie!
<br/>
What a lovely family heirloom!
<br/>
The fires of love!
<br/>
This will be perfect
on the top of her tree.
<br/>
Oh, Martha! Oh, Christmas!
<br/>
I want you all to look
your best tomorrow.
<br/>
You don't have a chance with her.
<br/>
You're 8 years old and you have a beard!
<br/>
Has everyone given their gifts?
<br/>
- I haven't.
- What?
<br/>
Merry Christmas, Martha May.
<br/>
Why do you have a bag on your head?
<br/>
Probably because he's embarrassed
by that hideodorous gift.
<br/>
Mr. Grinch...
<br/>
please take the bag off.
<br/>
Yes, you.
<br/>
Take it off.
<br/>
Put the book down.
<br/>
And your foot.
<br/>
Look at that hack job!
<br/>
Stupid present!
<br/>
Stupid tree!
<br/>
I hate Christmas!
<br/>
- The anger.
- The fury!
<br/>
The muscles!
<br/>
It was a horrible day
when they were so cruel to him.
<br/>
And...
<br/>
I could hardly bear it.
<br/>
I hate Christmas! I hate it!
<br/>
And that was the last time
we ever saw him.
<br/>
The very last time.
<br/>
So, whatever the reason,
his heart or his shoes...
<br/>
he stood outside his cave...
<br/>
hating the Whos.
<br/>
Alphabetically.
<br/>
Aardvarkian Abakenezer Who...
<br/>
I...
<br/>
hate you!
<br/>
Aaron B. Benson Who, I hate you.
<br/>
Hate, hate, hate. Hate, hate, hate.
<br/>
Double hate.
<br/>
Loathe entirely!
<br/>
Nutcrackers?
<br/>
It's their Whobilation.
<br/>
He snarled with a sneer.
<br/>
Tomorrow is Christmas!
It's practically here.
<br/>
Max!
<br/>
Fetch me my sedative.
<br/>
Now to take care
of those pesky memories.
<br/>
"Whobilation, plentiful
with candy canes and pies
<br/>
"I can't wait to get there
to eat some google fries
<br/>
"Whobilation, Whobilation"
<br/>
- Dad?
- Yeah.
<br/>
I've been thinking about the Whobilation
and I may do something drastic.
<br/>
That's fine, dear. Ask your mother.
<br/>
- Where did she go?
- Honey!
<br/>
Honey! Hi!
<br/>
Look, I just found the cutest light
for my Christmas display.
<br/>
Hurry up, we're gonna be late. Come on.
<br/>
And now, the nominations...
<br/>
for that Who among us
who best typifies...
<br/>
the qualities of Whodom and Whodery...
<br/>
the Whoville holiday cheermeister!
<br/>
Do I hear a nomination?
<br/>
I nominate the Grinch!
<br/>
- The Grinch?
- The Grinch?
<br/>
My, my, my.
<br/>
What an altruistic daughter
you have there, Lou!
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Cindy?
<br/>
Let me quote a verse...
<br/>
from The Book of Who.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
"The term 'Grinchy' shall apply
when Christmas spirit is in short supply."
<br/>
Now, I ask you: Does that sound
like our holiday cheermeister?
<br/>
True, Mr. May-Who.
But The Book of Who says this too:
<br/>
"No matter how different
a Who may appear...
<br/>
"he will always be welcomed
with holiday cheer."
<br/>
Yes, the book also says, the...
<br/>
"The award...
<br/>
"cannot go to the Grinch, because...
<br/>
"sometimes things
get the lead-pipe cinch."
<br/>
You made that up! It doesn't say that.
<br/>
No, it does.
<br/>
What page?
<br/>
Lost my place, but it's...
<br/>
It's in here!
<br/>
But the book does say:
<br/>
"The cheermeister is the one
who deserves a back slap or a toast.
<br/>
"And it goes to the soul at Christmas
who needs it most."
<br/>
And I believe that soul is the Grinch.
<br/>
And if you're the Whos I hope you are,
you will too.
<br/>
She's right!
<br/>
Fine.
<br/>
You people want to waste
a perfectly good nomination...
<br/>
why, it's up to you.
<br/>
But I am telling you...
<br/>
the Grinch will never come down.
<br/>
And when he doesn't,
the Mayor will wear the crown.
<br/>
Well, more or less.
<br/>
"Deck your heart with jollity
<br/>
"Style your smile all Christmas-y
<br/>
"Flick some flocking on the tree
<br/>
"Let there be Whobilation
<br/>
"Bake the fruitcake, egg the nog
<br/>
"Feed the flaming Who-ltide log
<br/>
"Baste the beast and gulp the grog
<br/>
"Let there be Whobilation
<br/>
"Tick, tock, tick, tock
<br/>
"Counting down the Christmas clock
<br/>
"Old, young, big, small"
<br/>
Blast this Christmas music.
<br/>
It's joyful and triumphant.
<br/>
Must drown them out!
<br/>
Not working!
<br/>
The whipperwinds whipped
high above the Who town.
<br/>
A trip or a slip
you'd slide all the way down.
<br/>
But this girl had a mission.
She knew what to do.
<br/>
She'd invite the Grinch herself,
that brave Cindy Lou.
<br/>
Play, monkey! Play!
<br/>
Howdy?
<br/>
Mr. Grinch?
<br/>
Mr. Grinch!
<br/>
Hello?
<br/>
Excuse me.
<br/>
Hello...
<br/>
little girl.
<br/>
How dare you enter...
<br/>
the Grinch's lair?
<br/>
The impudence! The audacity!
<br/>
The unmitigated gall!
<br/>
You called down the thunder...
<br/>
now, get ready for the boom!
<br/>
Gaze into the face of fear!
<br/>
Mr. Grinch...
<br/>
my name is Cindy Lou Who.
<br/>
You see?
<br/>
Even now the terror
is welling up inside you.
<br/>
I'm not scared.
<br/>
Denial is to be expected
in the face of pure evil.
<br/>
I don't think so.
<br/>
Doubt?
<br/>
Another unmistakable sign
of the heebie-jeebies!
<br/>
Now you're doomed!
<br/>
Run for your life...
<br/>
before I kill again!
<br/>
I'm a psycho!
<br/>
Danger! Danger!
<br/>
Maybe you need a time-out.
<br/>
Kids today.
<br/>
So desensitized by movies
and television.
<br/>
What do you want?
<br/>
Mr. Grinch, I came to invite you...
<br/>
to be holiday cheermeister.
<br/>
- "Holiday Whobie-what-y"?
- Cheermeister.
<br/>
"Cheermeister. Celebrate with friends."
<br/>
That's a good one.
<br/>
I know you hate Christmas,
but what if it's all just a misunderstanding?
<br/>
- Don't care.
- I myself am having some Yuletide doubts.
<br/>
But maybe if you reunite
with the Whos and be a part of Christmas...
<br/>
"Maybe if you reunite with the Whos
and be a part of Christmas."
<br/>
Grow up!
<br/>
Then maybe it'll be
all right for me, too!
<br/>
I'm sorry, your session is over.
<br/>
Please make another appointment
with the receptionist on the way out.
<br/>
Please, please.
You have to accept the award.
<br/>
Award?
<br/>
You never mentioned an award!
<br/>
Yeah, with a trophy and everything.
<br/>
- And I won?
- You won!
<br/>
- That means there were losers.
- I guess.
<br/>
- So, if you come...
- A town full of losers!
<br/>
I like it.
<br/>
Was anyone emotionally shattered?
<br/>
Come on, a minute ago
I couldn't shut you up! Details, details!
<br/>
The Mayor wasn't happy.
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
Martha May will be there.
<br/>
She will?
<br/>
And she'll see me.
<br/>
A winner.
<br/>
She'll be on me like fleegle flies
on a flat-faced floogle horse.
<br/>
I'm sorry to disappoint you, Martha, baby,
but the G train has left the station.
<br/>
So, will you come?
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
I don't know if it's
that adorable twinkle in your eye...
<br/>
or that nonconformist streak...
<br/>
that reminds me of a younger,
less hairy me.
<br/>
But you've convinced me.
<br/>
Who knows? This Whobilation
could change my entire outlook on life!
<br/>
- Really?
- No.
<br/>
There you are, honey.
<br/>
You can make snow angels later.
<br/>
We can't be late for the Whobilation!
<br/>
The nerve of those Whos.
<br/>
Inviting me down there
on such short notice.
<br/>
Even if I wanted to go,
my schedule wouldn't allow it.
<br/>
"4:00, wallow in self-pity.
<br/>
"4:30, stare into the abyss.
<br/>
"5:00, solve world hunger...
<br/>
"tell no one.
<br/>
"5:30, jazzercise.
<br/>
"6:30, dinner with me."
I can't cancel that again.
<br/>
"7:00, wrestle with my self-loathing."
<br/>
I'm booked.
<br/>
If I bumped the loathing to 9:00,
I'd have time to lay in bed...
<br/>
stare at the ceiling
and slip slowly into madness.
<br/>
But what would I wear?
<br/>
It's not a dress, it's a kilt!
<br/>
Sicko!
<br/>
Stupid.
<br/>
Ugly.
<br/>
Out of date.
<br/>
This is ridiculous.
<br/>
If I can't find something nice to wear,
I'm not going!
<br/>
That's it, I'm not going.
<br/>
It's time for our Holiday Cheermeister
of the Year Award!
<br/>
Congratulations, Mr. Grinch!
<br/>
He isn't here.
<br/>
What?
<br/>
He didn't show?
<br/>
Who could have predicted this?
<br/>
All right. I'll swing by for a minute,
allow them to envy me...
<br/>
grab a handful of popcorn shrimp,
and blow out of there.
<br/>
But what if it's a cruel prank?
What if it's a cash bar?
<br/>
How dare they?
<br/>
All right, I'll go.
<br/>
But I'll be fashionably late.
<br/>
No. Yes. No. Yes. No!
<br/>
Yes!
<br/>
Definitely not!
<br/>
All right. I've made my decision!
<br/>
I'm going, and that's that.
<br/>
Had my fingers crossed.
<br/>
Maybe I should flip a coin!
<br/>
I guess the award goes to...
<br/>
the runner-up.
<br/>
That's right. A man for whom
Christmas comes not once a year...
<br/>
but every minute of every day.
<br/>
A handsome, noble man.
<br/>
A man who
has had his tonsils removed twice!
<br/>
That's an interesting story.
<br/>
You see, what happened was...
<br/>
Hello, Martha.
<br/>
He made it!
<br/>
- Cindy.
- Honey!
<br/>
Look...
<br/>
Hot crowd. Hot crowd.
<br/>
I believe I'm here to...
<br/>
accept an award of some kind.
<br/>
And the child mentioned a check.
<br/>
- No, I didn't.
- All right, then, give me the award.
<br/>
Come on, while I'm young!
<br/>
Don't you worry, Mr. Holiday Cheermeister,
you'll get your award.
<br/>
But first, a little family reunion.
<br/>
They nursed you. They clothed you.
<br/>
Here they are...
<br/>
your old biddies!
<br/>
Are you two still living?
<br/>
We missed you!
<br/>
Rose. The sweater. The sweater, Rose.
<br/>
Sweater? What are you talkin' about?
No, I can't!
<br/>
I can't do that!
<br/>
Don't touch me there!
<br/>
Put him in the Chair of Cheer!
<br/>
Chair of Cheer?
<br/>
What's the Chair of Cheer?
<br/>
You didn't tell me
about the Chair of Cheer.
<br/>
Please, Mr. Grinch.
<br/>
No. I can't do it, honestly.
<br/>
I'm not ready. It's too much, too soon!
<br/>
It's that time of year.
<br/>
The Cheermeister's ride
in the Chair of Cheer!
<br/>
Put me down! I mean it!
<br/>
I've got a lawyer.
<br/>
There'll be hell to pay!
<br/>
First, you'll put
your taste buds to the test...
<br/>
as you judge the Who pudding cook-off!
<br/>
- Mine first.
- I really don't know...
<br/>
No, mine's the best!
<br/>
You'll enjoy this!
<br/>
This is not pudding.
<br/>
What is it?
<br/>
This is mine. Yummy, yummy, yummy.
<br/>
Christmas conga!
<br/>
Look at the time.
I really should be getting back.
<br/>
All right!
<br/>
Fruitcake, tra-la-la!
<br/>
No.
<br/>
Fudge Judge.
<br/>
Made it myself.
<br/>
Yeah? Mine are homemade too.
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
Put it in. Bring it on!
<br/>
Is that all you got?
<br/>
Is that all you got? Come on.
<br/>
Out of the way, slow-mo!
<br/>
Excuse me.
<br/>
He's number one in the sack race run!
<br/>
Number one! I'm number one!
<br/>
I'm number one!
<br/>
No child can beat the Grinch!
<br/>
I beat you.
<br/>
He won!
<br/>
And now it's time for the moment
we've all been waiting for.
<br/>
Yes! My award.
<br/>
- Write the check.
- There's no check.
<br/>
Are you sure? Because I thought
I heard someone mention a check.
<br/>
I said, there's no check.
And now it's time...
<br/>
for Present Pass-it-on!
<br/>
As always, we start
with our Cheermeister.
<br/>
The gift of a Christmas shave.
<br/>
Look at that hack job!
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes. Good times!
<br/>
Good times.
<br/>
And now, I have a little something
for the love of my life.
<br/>
Martha May...
<br/>
please become Mrs. Augustus May-Who.
<br/>
Augustus...
<br/>
If you agree to be my wife...
<br/>
along with a lifetime supply of happiness,
you'll also receive this:
<br/>
It's a new car!
<br/>
Generously provided
by the taxpayers of Whoville!
<br/>
What do you say, Martha?
<br/>
You got 20 seconds on the clock.
<br/>
I...
<br/>
These gifts are quite dazzling.
<br/>
Of course they are.
<br/>
That's what it's all about, isn't it?
<br/>
That's what it's always been about!
<br/>
Gifts!
<br/>
Gifts.
<br/>
Gifts, gifts, gifts.
<br/>
You want to know what happens
to your gifts?
<br/>
They all come to me. In your garbage.
<br/>
You see what I'm saying?
<br/>
In your garbage!
<br/>
I could hang myself with all the bad
Christmas neckties I found at the dump!
<br/>
And the avarice.
<br/>
The avarice never ends!
<br/>
"I want golf clubs." "I want diamonds."
<br/>
"I want a pony, so I can ride it twice,
get bored, and sell it to make glue."
<br/>
Look, I don't want to make waves,
but this whole Christmas season is...
<br/>
stupid, stupid, stupid!
<br/>
There is, however...
<br/>
one teeny-tiny...
<br/>
Christmas tradition...
<br/>
I find...
<br/>
quite meaningful.
<br/>
Mistletoe.
<br/>
Now, pucker up and kiss it, Whoville!
<br/>
Somebody's fabulous!
<br/>
All right, your turn! Go on!
<br/>
- Let's go!
- No!
<br/>
Excuse me, old-timer.
<br/>
Mind if I wet my whistle?
<br/>
That's my good stuff!
<br/>
Burn, baby! Burn!
<br/>
The Whomanity!
<br/>
- Let's go! Come on!
- No, wait!
<br/>
- Do something.
- Right!
<br/>
Calling all units. Calling all units.
<br/>
Taxi!
<br/>
It's because I'm green, isn't it?
<br/>
Halt!
<br/>
Evening, folks. Mind if I ride along?
<br/>
You might want to scooch over.
<br/>
You did the right thing.
<br/>
Out of the way!
<br/>
That's gonna hurt in the morning.
<br/>
It's gonna blow!
<br/>
You fellas all right?
<br/>
How about a nice hat?
<br/>
Lou?
<br/>
I'm hurt, Lou.
<br/>
I'm hurt, and I don't hurt easily.
<br/>
But you and your family...
<br/>
I'm so...
<br/>
disappointed.
<br/>
Can we just get back to Christmas...
<br/>
the way it should be?
<br/>
Grinch-less?
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
I just wanted everybody
to be together for Christmas.
<br/>
I quite enjoyed that.
<br/>
I hope I get another invite soon.
<br/>
Come on, come on!
<br/>
Good thing we have a spare.
<br/>
Suffering snorkelblatz!
<br/>
They're relentless!
<br/>
Only four hours till Christmas!
<br/>
Yes, the Grinch knew tomorrow
all the Who girls and boys...
<br/>
would wake bright and early
and rush for their toys.
<br/>
And then, the noise!
<br/>
The noise, noise, noise!
<br/>
They'll bang on tong-tinglers.
<br/>
They'll blow their floo-flounders.
<br/>
They'll crash on jang-jinglers
and bounce on boing-bounders!
<br/>
Then Whos young and old
would sit down to a feast.
<br/>
And they'll feast and they'll feast.
<br/>
And they'll feast, feast, feast, feast!
<br/>
They'll eat their Who pudding.
<br/>
And rare Who roast beast!
<br/>
But there's something
I just cannot stand in the least.
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
I'm speaking in rhyme!
<br/>
Blast you Whos!
<br/>
And the more the Grinch thought
of what Christmas would bring...
<br/>
the more the Grinch thought:
<br/>
I must stop this whole thing.
<br/>
Why, for year after year
I've put up with it now!
<br/>
I must stop this Christmas from coming!
But how?
<br/>
I mean, in what way?
<br/>
"Christmas is goin' to the dogs
<br/>
"We're scoffing down
the turkey and the grog
<br/>
"Things are looking
very good, it's true"
<br/>
Are you having a holly, jolly...
<br/>
Christmas?
<br/>
Wrong-o!
<br/>
If you're not going to help me...
<br/>
then you might as well...
<br/>
Then he got an idea.
<br/>
An awful idea.
<br/>
The Grinch got a wonderful...
<br/>
awful idea.
<br/>
I know just what to do.
<br/>
The Grinch laughed in his throat.
<br/>
And he made a quick
Santy Claus hat and a coat.
<br/>
And he chuckled and clucked...
<br/>
at this great Grinchy trick.
<br/>
With this coat and this hat,
I'll look just like Saint Nick.
<br/>
"You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch
<br/>
"You really are a heel
<br/>
"You're as cuddly as a cactus
and as charming as an eel
<br/>
"Mr. Grinch
<br/>
"You're a bad banana
<br/>
"With a greasy black peel
<br/>
"Just face the music, you're a monster
<br/>
"Mr. Grinch, yes, you are
<br/>
"Your heart's an empty hole
<br/>
"Your brain is full of spiders
You got garlic in your soul
<br/>
"Mr. Grinch
<br/>
"I wouldn't touch you with a
<br/>
"thirty-nine-and-a-half foot pole"
<br/>
I asked for three-quarters,
not five-eighths.
<br/>
Stay focused!
<br/>
"You know, if you asked
the who's who of Whoville
<br/>
"No one would deny it"
<br/>
Air bag is a little slow.
<br/>
But that's what these tests are for!
<br/>
"You're a vile one
<br/>
"Mr. Grinch
<br/>
"You have termites in your smile
<br/>
"You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
<br/>
"Mr. Grinch
<br/>
"Given the choice between you
<br/>
"I'd take the seasick crocodile"
<br/>
Fat boy should be finishing up
anytime now.
<br/>
Talk about a recluse.
<br/>
He only comes out once a year,
and he never catches any flak for it!
<br/>
Probably lives up there
to avoid the taxes.
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Oopsie.
<br/>
Forgot about the reindeer.
<br/>
Did that stop the old Grinch?
<br/>
No.
<br/>
The Grinch simply said:
<br/>
If I can't find a reindeer...
<br/>
I'll make one instead.
<br/>
Oh, Max!
<br/>
So he called his dog Max...
<br/>
and he took some red thread...
<br/>
and tied a big horn on top of his head.
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
You're a reindeer.
Here's your motivation.
<br/>
You're Rudolph, a freak with a red nose,
nobody likes you.
<br/>
Then one day,
Santa picks you and you save Christmas.
<br/>
No, forget that part. We'll improvise.
<br/>
Just keep it kind of loosey-goosey.
<br/>
You hate Christmas!
You're gonna steal it!
<br/>
Saving Christmas was a lousy ending.
Way too commercial.
<br/>
Action!
<br/>
Brilliant!
<br/>
You reject your own nose...
<br/>
because it represents the
glitter of commercialism!
<br/>
Why didn't I think of that?
<br/>
Cut, print, check the gate. Moving on.
<br/>
That...
<br/>
feels...
<br/>
good.
<br/>
Here goes nothin', hot dog!
<br/>
Wow!
<br/>
This is nuts!
<br/>
On, Crasher! On, Thrasher!
<br/>
On, Vomit and Blitzkrieg!
<br/>
We're gonna die!
<br/>
We're gonna die!
<br/>
I'm going to throw up,
and then I'm gonna die!
<br/>
Mommy, tell it to stop!
<br/>
Almost lost my cool there.
<br/>
All their windows were dark.
Quiet snow filled the air.
<br/>
All the Whos were all dreaming
sweet dreams without care...
<br/>
when he came to the first
little house on the square.
<br/>
Welcome to Whoville, Max.
<br/>
Betty?
<br/>
- Betty?
- What?
<br/>
Did you hear something?
<br/>
It's Santa!
<br/>
Go right back to sleep.
<br/>
Come on, Max. It's our first stop.
<br/>
The old Grinchy Claus hissed.
<br/>
And he climbed to the roof,
empty bags in his fist.
<br/>
He'd slide down the chimney.
A rather tight pinch.
<br/>
But if Santa could do it,
then so could the Grinch.
<br/>
He's planning a double-twisting
interrupted forward-flying 2-and-a-half...
<br/>
with a combo tuck and pike.
<br/>
High degree of difficulty.
<br/>
He got stuck only once,
for a moment or two.
<br/>
Blasted water weight!
Goes right to my hips.
<br/>
Then he stuck his head
out of the fireplace flue.
<br/>
A little more stealth, please.
<br/>
Where the little Who stockings
all hung in a row.
<br/>
These stockings...
<br/>
he grinned...
<br/>
are the first thing to go.
<br/>
Okay, fellas. Show time.
<br/>
Then he slunk to the icebox.
<br/>
Slunk?
<br/>
He eyed the Whos' feast.
He took the Who pudding.
<br/>
He took the roast beast.
<br/>
Hike!
<br/>
He cleaned out that icebox
as quick as a flash.
<br/>
Why, that Grinch,
he even took their last can of Who hash.
<br/>
Then he stuffed all the food
up the chimney with glee.
<br/>
And now...
<br/>
grinned the Grinch...
<br/>
I'll stuff up the tree.
<br/>
And the Grinch grabbed the tree,
and he started to shove...
<br/>
when he heard a small sound
like the coo of a dove.
<br/>
Excuse me.
<br/>
The Grinch had been caught
by this tiny Who daughter...
<br/>
who'd got out of bed
for a cup of cold water.
<br/>
Santa Claus?
What are you doing with our tree?
<br/>
But, you know, that old Grinch
was so smart and so slick...
<br/>
he thought up a lie,
and he thought it up quick.
<br/>
Why...
<br/>
my sweet little tot.
<br/>
The fake Santa Claus lied.
<br/>
There's a light on this tree...
<br/>
that won't...
<br/>
light on one side.
<br/>
So I'm taking it home
to my workshop, my dear.
<br/>
I'll fix it up there...
<br/>
and I'll bring it back here.
<br/>
Santa, what's Christmas really about?
<br/>
Vengeance!
<br/>
I mean...
<br/>
presents...
<br/>
I suppose.
<br/>
I was afraid of that.
<br/>
And his fib fooled the child.
<br/>
Then he patted her head,
and he got her a drink...
<br/>
and he sent her to bed.
<br/>
Santa?
<br/>
- What?
- Don't forget the Grinch.
<br/>
I know he's mean and hairy and smelly.
<br/>
His hands might be cold and clammy.
<br/>
But I think he's actually kind of sweet.
<br/>
Sweet?
<br/>
You think he's sweet?
<br/>
Merry Christmas, Santa.
<br/>
And when Cindy Lou
went up with her cup...
<br/>
Nice kid.
<br/>
Bad judge of character.
<br/>
...he went to the chimney
and stuffed the tree up.
<br/>
And the last thing he took
was the log for their fire.
<br/>
On their walls he left nothing
but some hooks and some wire.
<br/>
And the one speck of food
that he'd left in the house...
<br/>
was a crumb that was even
too small for a mouse.
<br/>
Then he slithered and slunk,
with a smile most unpleasant...
<br/>
around each Who home,
and he took every present.
<br/>
Clearance sale.
<br/>
Everything must go.
<br/>
What now?
<br/>
Martha...
<br/>
have you ever kissed a man
who lost his tonsils twice?
<br/>
No, silly!
<br/>
But it's an experience
that I've always longed for.
<br/>
Kiss me, you fool!
<br/>
What are you laughing at...
<br/>
Rudolph?
<br/>
It's all you, Maxie!
<br/>
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit...
<br/>
he rode with his load
to the tiptop to dump it.
<br/>
We did it!
<br/>
We did it! We did it!
<br/>
That wasn't so bad, was it, Max?
<br/>
They'll be waking up now.
<br/>
And I know just what they'll do.
<br/>
All those Whos...
<br/>
down in Whoville...
<br/>
will all cry.
<br/>
What an embarrassment! I've been robbed!
<br/>
Mayor May-Who? Oh, dear.
<br/>
I wonder who could have done this.
<br/>
Tell you people one thing:
<br/>
Invite the Grinch...
<br/>
destroy Christmas.
<br/>
Invite the Grinch...
<br/>
destroy Christmas!
<br/>
But did anyone listen to me?
<br/>
- I did.
- No.
<br/>
You choose to listen...
<br/>
to a little not-to-be-taken
seriously girl...
<br/>
who hasn't even grown into her nose yet.
<br/>
Cindy, I hope you're very proud...
<br/>
of what you've done.
<br/>
If she isn't, I am.
<br/>
I'm glad he took our presents.
<br/>
- What?
- I...
<br/>
- I'm glad.
- He's glad.
<br/>
You're glad.
You're glad everything is gone.
<br/>
You're glad that the Grinch
virtually wrecked...
<br/>
No, not wrecked, pulverized Christmas.
<br/>
Is that what I'm hearing?
<br/>
You can't hurt Christmas, Mr. Mayor...
<br/>
because it isn't about the gifts
or the contests or the fancy lights.
<br/>
That's what Cindy's been trying
to tell everyone.
<br/>
And me. She's been trying to tell me.
<br/>
What is wrong with you? This is a child.
<br/>
She's my child.
<br/>
And she happens to be right, by the way.
<br/>
I don't need anything more for Christmas
than this right here, my family.
<br/>
- Merry Christmas, everybody!
- Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Merry Christmas,
you hunk of burnin' Who!
<br/>
Give me a break.
<br/>
Merry Christmas!
<br/>
Mr. Grinch?
<br/>
Mr. Grinch?
<br/>
Now for the final note in my symphony...
<br/>
of downright nasty not-niceness!
<br/>
The crescendo of my odious opus!
<br/>
The wailing and the gnashing of teeth.
<br/>
The bellowing
of the bitterly bummed out!
<br/>
It'll be like music to my ears!
<br/>
Then the Grinch heard
a sound rising over the snow.
<br/>
It started in low.
Then it started to grow.
<br/>
But the sound wasn't sad.
<br/>
Why, this sounded merry.
<br/>
But it was merry.
<br/>
Very.
<br/>
Every Who down in Whoville,
the tall and the small...
<br/>
were singing
without any presents at all.
<br/>
He hadn't stopped Christmas from coming.
<br/>
It came.
<br/>
Somehow or other, it came just the same!
<br/>
Mr. Grinch?
<br/>
And the Grinch, with his Grinch
feet ice-cold in the snow...
<br/>
stood puzzling and puzzling.
<br/>
How could it be so?
<br/>
It came without ribbons!
<br/>
It came without tags!
<br/>
It came without packages, boxes or bags!
<br/>
And he puzzled and puzzled...
<br/>
till his puzzler was sore.
<br/>
Then the Grinch thought of something...
<br/>
he hadn't before.
<br/>
Maybe...
<br/>
Christmas...
<br/>
he thought...
<br/>
doesn't come from a store.
<br/>
Maybe Christmas...
<br/>
perhaps...
<br/>
means a little bit more.
<br/>
Help me!
<br/>
I'm...
<br/>
feeling!
<br/>
And what happened then...
<br/>
well, in Whoville they say...
<br/>
that the Grinch's small heart...
<br/>
grew three sizes that day.
<br/>
What's happening to me?
<br/>
I'm all...
<br/>
toasty inside.
<br/>
And I'm leaking.
<br/>
Oh, Max.
<br/>
I love you!
<br/>
All right, that's enough.
Knock it off. Beat it!
<br/>
Get out of here!
<br/>
One step at a time.
<br/>
No. The sleigh. The presents.
<br/>
They'll be destroyed!
<br/>
And I care!
<br/>
What is the deal?
<br/>
Wait!
<br/>
This can't happen!
<br/>
It shouldn't! It couldn't!
It mustn't! It wouldn't!
<br/>
Not now, not then, not ever again!
<br/>
No!
<br/>
Oh, well.
<br/>
It's just toys, right?
<br/>
Hi, Mr. Grinch!
<br/>
Cindy Lou!
<br/>
What are you doing up there?
<br/>
I came to see you.
No one should be alone on Christmas.
<br/>
No!
<br/>
I got you, Cindy Lou!
<br/>
You did it!
<br/>
Spread eagle! Nailed it!
<br/>
Are you all right?
<br/>
Are you kiddin'?
<br/>
The sun is bright
and the powder's bitchin'!
<br/>
Now scoot over! It's my turn to drive!
<br/>
I'd better slow this buggy down!
<br/>
- We're gonna crash!
- Now you listen to me, young lady!
<br/>
Even if we're horribly mangled...
<br/>
there'll be no sad faces on Christmas.
<br/>
What is it?
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
- Cindy!
- Grinch?
<br/>
My baby!
<br/>
Grab an end.
<br/>
By the way, these lights
match your outfit perfectly.
<br/>
This could be more difficult
to negotiate.
<br/>
Heads up, Whoville!
<br/>
Hurry! Here he comes!
<br/>
Out of the way! I have no insurance!
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
Run for your lives!
<br/>
Watch out, I can't stop!
<br/>
- Daddy, move!
- Dad, move it!
<br/>
Thanks for the help.
<br/>
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hi, Cindy, honey!
<br/>
Merry Christmas...
<br/>
one and all!
<br/>
Cindy!
<br/>
Mommy!
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
What do we have here?
<br/>
You got me, Officer!
<br/>
I did it!
<br/>
I'm the Grinch that stole Christmas.
<br/>
And I'm...
<br/>
sorry.
<br/>
Aren't you gonna cuff me?
<br/>
Put me in a choke hold?
Blind me with pepper spray?
<br/>
You heard him, Officer. He admitted it.
<br/>
- I'd go with the pepper spray.
- Yes, I heard him, all right.
<br/>
He said he was sorry.
<br/>
Besides, it looks like everything
is all here and accounted for.
<br/>
Help me out here, people.
<br/>
Martha?
<br/>
Merry Christmas, August May-Who!
<br/>
I'm afraid I do have something for you!
<br/>
Your ring back.
<br/>
Sorry...
<br/>
but my heart belongs to...
<br/>
someone else.
<br/>
No hard feelings?
<br/>
Cheer up, dude. It's Christmas.
<br/>
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.
<br/>
Your cheek is so...
<br/>
I know.
<br/>
Hairy?
<br/>
- No.
- Greasy?
<br/>
Stinky? Do I have a zit?
<br/>
No.
<br/>
Warm.
<br/>
Fah who foraze, dah who doraze
<br/>
Welcome, Christmas, come this way
<br/>
Fah who foraze, dah who doraze
<br/>
Welcome, Christmas, Christmas Day
<br/>
Welcome, welcome, fah who Ramus
<br/>
Welcome, welcome, dah who Damus
<br/>
Christmas Day is in our grasp
<br/>
So long as we have hands to clasp
<br/>
Fah who ray-moo ya-who hee haw
<br/>
Welcome, Christmas, bring your cheer
<br/>
Fah who foraze
<br/>
Dah who doraze, welcome all Whos
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
So he brought back the toys
and the food for the feast.
<br/>
And he, he himself, the Grinch...
<br/>
carved the roast beast.
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
There's nothin' like the holidays.
<br/>
- Who wants the gizzard?
- I do!
<br/>
Too late!
<br/>
That'll be mine.
<br/>
Where are you, Christmas?
<br/>
I think I've found you
<br/>
This time I'll make you stay
<br/>
All will be singing
<br/>
Bells will be ringing
<br/>
Now and forever
<br/>
Christmas Day
<br/>
Where are you, Christmas
<br/>
Why can't I find you
<br/>
Why have you gone away
<br/>
Where is the laughter
<br/>
You used to bring me
<br/>
Why can't I hear music play
<br/>
My world is changing
<br/>
I'm rearranging
<br/>
Does that mean Christmas
<br/>
Changes too
<br/>
Where are you, Christmas
<br/>
Do you remember
<br/>
The one you used to know
<br/>
I'm not the same one
<br/>
See what the time's done
<br/>
Is that why you have
<br/>
Let me go
<br/>
Christmas is here
<br/>
Everywhere
<br/>
Christmas is here
<br/>
If you care
<br/>
If there is love
<br/>
In your heart and your mind
<br/>
You will feel like Christmas
all the time
<br/>
I feel you, Christmas
<br/>
I know I've found you
<br/>
You never fade away
<br/>
The joy of Christmas
<br/>
Stays here in silence
<br/>
Fills each and every heart
<br/>
With love
<br/>
They're makin' noise
<br/>
Noise, noise, noise
<br/>
How I hate their happy noise
<br/>
There's only one thing I hate more
<br/>
Come to think of it
<br/>
And that's the people who keep
<br/>
Makin' it
<br/>
Feast, feast, feast, feast
<br/>
They'll have more
than anyone could ever eat
<br/>
Me, I'm stuck here with my
<br/>
Cream of wheat
<br/>
There's no one here to feast with me
<br/>
On this lonely Christmas Eve
<br/>
Don't they know I'm up here all alone
<br/>
In my cave up in the hills
<br/>
How I wish that this would go away
<br/>
This dreadful holiday
<br/>
That they call Christmas Day
<br/>
It's a lonely Christmas Eve
<br/>
The streets are filled
with Christmas cheer
<br/>
At least it's only once a year
<br/>
Perfect parcels tied with perfect bows
<br/>
And carols ringing in my ear
<br/>
Bundled up against the cold
<br/>
Lines wherever gifts are sold
<br/>
Each shop window
displays a Christmas scene
<br/>
For everybody young and old
<br/>
Icicles on eaves troughs
and tinsel on the tree
<br/>
But it's a green Christmas for me
<br/>
Couples skating on the pond
<br/>
Makin' angels on the lawn
<br/>
Five red mittens drying on the rack
<br/>
And needle-shedding Tannenbaum
<br/>
Red bows on the railings
and snowflakes on the ground
<br/>
But it's a green Christmas in this town
<br/>
Green
<br/>
'Cause of everything I miss
<br/>
All this mistletoe, no kiss
<br/>
And with every Christmas wish
<br/>
There would be no greater gift
<br/>
Than to have this envy lift
<br/>
Carolers are at my door
<br/>
Don't wanna hear them anymore
<br/>
Stockings on the mantel
The snow's here every day
<br/>
But it's a green Christmas anyway
<br/>
Red nose on the reindeer
Tinsel on the tree
<br/>
But it's a green Christmas for me
