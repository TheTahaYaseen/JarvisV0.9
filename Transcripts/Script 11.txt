Once upon a time, in a faraway kingdom,<br/>
lived a beautiful little girl...<br/>
...and her widowed father.<br/>
It's beautiful.<br/>
Okay. It wasn't that long ago.<br/>
And it wasn't really a faraway kingdom.<br/>
It was the San Fernando Valley.<br/>
It looked faraway...<br/>
...because you barely see it through the smog.<br/>
But to me, growing up,<br/>
the Valley was my kingdom.<br/>
I was my dad's best friend.<br/>
And he was mine.<br/>
Being raised by a man put me behind in<br/>
the makeup and fashion departments.<br/>
But I never felt like I missed out<br/>
on anything.<br/>
I was the luckiest girl in the world.<br/>
My dad owned the coolest diner.<br/>
I loved hanging out there.<br/>
It was a kind of and it was by myself.<br/>
Diet was a four-letter word here...<br/>
...and grease came<br/>
at no additional charge.<br/>
At Hal's, everyone felt like family.<br/>
Oh, yeah, I have drinks.<br/>
Happy birthday!<br/>
Make a wish, princess.<br/>
What did I need a wish for?<br/>
I had amazing friends and the coolest dad.<br/>
But I guess my dad thought I needed<br/>
one more thing: Fiona.<br/>
I am so sorry.<br/>
You look beautiful, Fiona.<br/>
Hey, Hal!<br/>
Along with my new stepmother came<br/>
her twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella.<br/>
My out-of-step-sisters.<br/>
But as long as my dad was happy, so was I.<br/>
We were going to be one big, happy family.<br/>
Cheese.<br/>
One's enough.<br/>
Unfortunately, this was no fairy tale.<br/>
"He took her hand, and he kissed it.<br/>
Then he swooped her up onto<br/>
his horse.<br/>
And the beautiful princess and the<br/>
handsome prince rode off to his castle...<br/>
...where they lived happily ever after. "<br/>
Do fairy tales come true, Dad?<br/>
Well, no. But dreams come true.<br/>
- Do you have a dream?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
My dream is that you'll grow up<br/>
and go to college...<br/>
...and then maybe someday you'll build<br/>
your own castle.<br/>
Where do princesses go to college?<br/>
They go...<br/>
...where the princes go.<br/>
They go to Princeton.<br/>
But, Sam, you know, fairy tales aren't<br/>
just about finding handsome princes.<br/>
They're about fulfilling your dreams...<br/>
...and about standing up for what<br/>
you believe in.<br/>
As I always say, never let the<br/>
fear of striking out...<br/>
- Keep you from playing the game.<br/>
- Right.<br/>
Just remember, if you look carefully,<br/>
this book contains important things...<br/>
...that you may need to know<br/>
later in life.<br/>
- Earthquake.<br/>
- My kingdom crumbled...<br/>
...during the Northridge earthquake.<br/>
Help! Help!<br/>
- Don't go.<br/>
- I'll be right back.<br/>
I lost my best friend that day.<br/>
From then on, the only fairy tales<br/>
in my life...<br/>
...were the ones I read about in books.<br/>
Since my father didn't leave a will,<br/>
my stepmother got everything.<br/>
The house, the diner,<br/>
and to her dismay, me.<br/>
Sam.<br/>
Sammy.<br/>
Sam!<br/>
It's breakfast time.<br/>
So bring me my breakfast.<br/>
Sam!<br/>
Careful, ladies. Look for the eyes.<br/>
One, two, three, bicycle.<br/>
And feint. Magpie, magpie, magpie.<br/>
Flap and flap and flap. Mary Lou Retton!<br/>
Palm tree and palm tree.<br/>
Lady Liberty. Lady Liberty.<br/>
Around the harbor. Around the harbor.<br/>
Circle Line tour.<br/>
And hurricane.<br/>
Can you believe how extraordinarily<br/>
gifted my girls are?<br/>
Absolutely unbelievable. Really.<br/>
- Sam!<br/>
- Find each other. Look in the eyes.<br/>
- I'm coming.<br/>
- One, two, three and four...<br/>
...and right, left, up and down.<br/>
Is this the Norwegian salmon I asked for?<br/>
I need my omega-3s.<br/>
Only the best.<br/>
I can tell.<br/>
You know, it costs a fortune to fly<br/>
that stuff in from Norwegia.<br/>
And push it, ladies. Push it, ladies.<br/>
Push it, ladies.<br/>
Ready? Okay.<br/>
- Gross. Mom!<br/>
- I have a spastic colon.<br/>
Well, you have a spastic brain.<br/>
- Stop. Stop hitting her. Stop.<br/>
- You bit me.<br/>
What are you doing just standing there?<br/>
Get to work.<br/>
I can't go to work now.<br/>
I've got a big test I have to study for.<br/>
Listen, Sam. People go to school<br/>
to get smarter...<br/>
...so that they can get a job.<br/>
You already have a job.<br/>
So it's like skipping a step.<br/>
Come on, get going.<br/>
And Flying Karamazov.<br/>
No, honey. Leave those on.<br/>
The lawn looks a little brown.<br/>
Fiona, we're supposed to be conserving<br/>
water. We're in the middle of a drought.<br/>
Droughts are for poor people.<br/>
Do you think J. Lo has a brown lawn?<br/>
People who use extra water<br/>
have extra class.<br/>
You call that grade-A beef? Well, that cow<br/>
must have cheated on his test.<br/>
Pickup.<br/>
Bobby, enough with the salmon.<br/>
You already made a salmon omelet, salmon<br/>
soup and salmon pudding. Come on.<br/>
- Help me. Fiona wants to eat me.<br/>
- That's nasty.<br/>
- Bite me, Rhonda. Bite me.<br/>
- That's nasty.<br/>
- Eleanor, your order's up.<br/>
- Coming. I got it.<br/>
Safe.<br/>
I'm okay.<br/>
- Chuck, how you doing?<br/>
- Super.<br/>
That's good. So cheese omelet,<br/>
extra bacon, crisp...<br/>
...blueberry muffin and a Coke.<br/>
- Make it a Diet Coke.<br/>
I'm trying to watch my weight.<br/>
It ain't going nowhere.<br/>
Pick up these salmon waffles.<br/>
- Sam, why are you still here?<br/>
- I'm almost done.<br/>
- You'll be late for school.<br/>
- I'll get there.<br/>
- Fiona goes ballistic if I don't finish.<br/>
- I don't care.<br/>
What I care about is your education.<br/>
She's got you getting up<br/>
at the crack of dawn.<br/>
- Your dad would want you at school.<br/>
- But...<br/>
No more "buts. " You just leave Fiona<br/>
and her big butt to me.<br/>
- Thanks, Rhonda.<br/>
- Get.<br/>
Hey, looking good, Mr. Farrell.<br/>
A man's best friend is his Mercedes,<br/>
Sam.<br/>
I'll remember that.<br/>
Any... Anything is possible<br/>
if you just believe.<br/>
- Anything is possible if you just...<br/>
- Audition today, son?<br/>
- Yeah, 5:00, all right? Tell Mom.<br/>
- Knock them dead.<br/>
Dad. Now, do you see what I have to go<br/>
to school in? No offense, Sam.<br/>
Honestly, don't you feel sorry<br/>
for me?<br/>
No, I feel sorry about the three cars<br/>
we got you that you totaled.<br/>
Okay. All right.<br/>
- Carter, what are you wearing?<br/>
- What...?<br/>
This is my Snoop Dizzle look.<br/>
I cannot drive you to school like that.<br/>
Sam, I am a Method actor, okay?<br/>
This is part of my training.<br/>
I know, I know, I know. But look at this.<br/>
All right. Take two.<br/>
Buenos dias, Fighting Frogs.<br/>
Here's your daily drought reminder<br/>
to conserve agua.<br/>
Cut your showers short.<br/>
Brownie points go out to Mr. Rothman,<br/>
who hasn't had one in weeks.<br/>
Remember, today's your last chance<br/>
to get tickets...<br/>
...to the big Halloween homecoming<br/>
dance.<br/>
You too can dress up like someone<br/>
you're not, for a change.<br/>
- I mean, I...<br/>
- I pledge allegiance to the flag...<br/>
...of the United States of America,<br/>
and to the republic...<br/>
...for which it stands, one nation...<br/>
Primo parking spot dead ahead.<br/>
- Okay, there's a spot. There's a spot.<br/>
- Sam, watch out. Watch out.<br/>
Okay. You snooze, you lose!<br/>
Well, if it isn't Shelby Cummings<br/>
and her ladies in waiting.<br/>
- Shelby wants me so bad.<br/>
- You've never even talked to her before.<br/>
Oh, I've talked to her. Okay?<br/>
In my mind. And let me tell you,<br/>
in my mind, she wants me so bad.<br/>
Carter, you could do so much better than<br/>
Shelby Cummings. Even in your mind.<br/>
- There's another spot.<br/>
- Got it.<br/>
Come on.<br/>
Austin.<br/>
People like Shelby and Austin...<br/>
...are genetically programmed<br/>
to find each other.<br/>
How can so much ego be<br/>
in one relationship?<br/>
- Imagine what they say about you.<br/>
- They don't even know I exist.<br/>
Stalkerazzi at 3 o'clock.<br/>
The white zone is for cool people only.<br/>
No geeks.<br/>
Hey, diner girl, can I get a<br/>
breakfast burrito to go? Thank you.<br/>
And you thought they didn't<br/>
know you exist.<br/>
- That car's as old as that hat.<br/>
- Right.<br/>
Move. Move. Move.<br/>
- Move. Move.<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
Shelby. Hey, sister-friend.<br/>
Remind me why we tolerate them.<br/>
They gave you a Prada bag<br/>
for your birthday.<br/>
Try "Frada" bag. Totally fake.<br/>
Greetings. Samantha, you look absolutely<br/>
stunning today, as per usual.<br/>
Thank you, Terry.<br/>
If you'll excuse me, I must get back<br/>
to my galaxy now.<br/>
Zion, Lieutenant Terry here. Hello?<br/>
Can you hear me? Captain?<br/>
You're going in and out.<br/>
- Poor guy.<br/>
- At least he's happy.<br/>
- Happy? Guy lives in another world.<br/>
- I copy.<br/>
Sometimes fantasy is better<br/>
than reality, Carter.<br/>
- Speaking of fantasy.<br/>
- I'll see you later.<br/>
Yes, the secret admirer beckons.<br/>
Where have you been?<br/>
We haven't talked in ages.<br/>
We talked this morning.<br/>
I can't stop thinking about you.<br/>
What's on your mind right now?<br/>
You first.<br/>
Well, I'm thinking that Professor Rothman's<br/>
dissected one too many frogs.<br/>
Ribet, ribet.<br/>
Laugh out loud.<br/>
I wanna hear your laugh.<br/>
When can we finally meet?<br/>
Soon.<br/>
How's your day so far?<br/>
Raging stepmom, work and cool kids<br/>
who can't get over themselves.<br/>
- Ever feel like you don't belong?<br/>
- Absolutely.<br/>
I can be surrounded by a sea<br/>
of people and still feel all alone.<br/>
Then I think of you.<br/>
Hey, Nomad, do you think<br/>
we've ever met?<br/>
I don't know. Our school<br/>
has over 3500 kids.<br/>
Well, that narrows it down.<br/>
Well, at least I can eliminate the guys.<br/>
You're not a guy, right? Because if you are,<br/>
I'll kick your butt.<br/>
I am not a guy.<br/>
Have you told your dad<br/>
about Princeton yet?<br/>
If only I could. I haven't even told him<br/>
I wanna be a writer.<br/>
My father always encouraged me<br/>
to pursue my dreams.<br/>
Not mine. He has another plan<br/>
for my life.<br/>
It's 2 a. m. We've been at this<br/>
for five hours.<br/>
Well, I think we broke our record.<br/>
- We should turn in. Sweet dreams.<br/>
- Wait.<br/>
I can't sleep without knowing<br/>
there's hope.<br/>
Half the night I waste in sighs.<br/>
In a wakeful doze I sorrow.<br/>
For the hand, the lips...<br/>
...the eyes.<br/>
For the meeting of tomorrow.<br/>
Quoting Tennyson. Impressive.<br/>
Please meet me at the<br/>
homecoming dance.<br/>
I'll be waiting for you at 11:00<br/>
in the middle of the dance floor.<br/>
Sweet dreams.<br/>
That was close.<br/>
- You're finally gonna be able to meet him.<br/>
- I don't know. He's too good to be true.<br/>
Come on. It's been, like, a month since you<br/>
met him in that Princeton chat room, okay?<br/>
- You talk to him all the time. You know him.<br/>
- I know, but he doesn't know me.<br/>
What if I meet him<br/>
and I'm not what he expects?<br/>
Maybe this whole relationship's<br/>
just better for cyberspace.<br/>
Listen, okay? You have to go<br/>
to that dance, okay?<br/>
This Nomad guy isn't gonna be in one place<br/>
for long, all right?<br/>
- Lf it helps, I'll be your escort.<br/>
- Really?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- You rock, Carter.<br/>
- Hello?<br/>
- Sam.<br/>
Some little brat got into my salmon<br/>
and ate it all.<br/>
I need more salmon.<br/>
And pick up my dry cleaning.<br/>
And wash the Jag.<br/>
Fiona. One more pitch.<br/>
- Why do you act like her slave?<br/>
- Simple. No Fiona, no money for Princeton.<br/>
- That sucks.<br/>
- Tell me about it.<br/>
Hey, it's out of here.<br/>
Damn, a girl hit that.<br/>
See, now that's impressive.<br/>
So, what are you and Shelby going<br/>
to the dance as?<br/>
I don't know if I'm going with Shelby.<br/>
You're not gonna go with Shelby?<br/>
Who else you gonna go with?<br/>
I don't know. It's a mystery to me.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- You're welcome.<br/>
Okay, guys. Come on.<br/>
A little bit further. Right there.<br/>
Thirty percent off for USC alumni.<br/>
Looks good, my friend.<br/>
Make sure you get these rims.<br/>
- Austin.<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
What's with all those college brochures<br/>
in your bedroom?<br/>
What are you doing in my room?<br/>
- I'm trying to keep my options open.<br/>
- You don't need options.<br/>
It is all taken care of.<br/>
Look, son, we've been working on this<br/>
program since you were 9 years old.<br/>
You're gonna play USC football,<br/>
graduate...<br/>
...and then you'll manage this business<br/>
with me. Your future's set.<br/>
So don't mess with the plan. All right?<br/>
Wouldn't think of it.<br/>
There's another customer.<br/>
Go make them happy.<br/>
Yes, sir, here's your car.<br/>
Well, you need a wax.<br/>
- Excuse me?<br/>
- I meant the car.<br/>
Oh, fine.<br/>
- Austin.<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
- We need our cars washed.<br/>
- Yeah, look.<br/>
Dirt.<br/>
One second, ladies. All right.<br/>
Take this inside when you're done.<br/>
Thank you very much.<br/>
Oh, my God, he is an angel.<br/>
- He's so cute.<br/>
- I know.<br/>
So who'd you guys pay to make<br/>
your cars so dirty?<br/>
Excuse me? Like, what are you,<br/>
the dirt police?<br/>
Yeah. The dirt police.<br/>
Like, excuse me, miss, do you know<br/>
how fast your dirt was going?<br/>
You should have stopped<br/>
with the dirt police.<br/>
You should get going,<br/>
because our mom's looking for you.<br/>
- Well, where is she?<br/>
- She's at home, baking.<br/>
- You wanted to see me?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
Oh, my... Did you finish your errands?<br/>
Because I need you to head to the diner<br/>
and take the night shift.<br/>
Tonight's my night off and it's<br/>
the Halloween dance at school, so...<br/>
I know, but you need to stop being so<br/>
self-centered and start thinking of others.<br/>
Others need you to go to the diner<br/>
and mop the floors tonight.<br/>
But I really need to go to this dance,<br/>
Fiona. I have to.<br/>
You need to earn your tuition money<br/>
for college.<br/>
You gotta bus a lot of tables.<br/>
I'm a straight-A student. I work seven days<br/>
a week and I'm taking extra AP classes.<br/>
I never asked you for anything.<br/>
Please let me go to this dance.<br/>
Sweetheart, now that you're<br/>
old enough...<br/>
...there's something I've always wanted to<br/>
tell you, and I think you're ready to hear it.<br/>
You're not very pretty,<br/>
and you're not very bright.<br/>
I'm so glad we had that talk.<br/>
- Man, you...<br/>
- Scoot over, bro.<br/>
- See if we can get a bigger table.<br/>
- Move over.<br/>
You're in my way.<br/>
It must be Halloween. Look what just<br/>
flew in. The wicked witch of the Valley.<br/>
I'm gonna be picking up Gabriella<br/>
and Brianna at the Halloween dance.<br/>
- I'll be back by 12 sharp.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
Still got room in there, huh?<br/>
Well, if it isn't little Betty Crocker<br/>
from the 'hood.<br/>
Don't you have something to do,<br/>
like cleaning toilets?<br/>
You know, I would, but I'm too busy<br/>
running this place. But be my guest.<br/>
I'm sorry, I can't, because I just got<br/>
a $ 150 manicure. Silver palm trees.<br/>
Keep it up, Fiona, and I'm gonna find<br/>
a place to put my $6 pedicure.<br/>
Where are your skates?<br/>
That's part of the uniform.<br/>
Fiona, if I wanted to look like a clown,<br/>
I'd join the circus.<br/>
If you were part of my circus, I'd have you<br/>
clean elephant butts with a Wet One.<br/>
- I don't think you realize that I could...<br/>
- Fire me? Oh, please, go right ahead.<br/>
And let's see how many customers<br/>
you have left when you do.<br/>
I am a very appealing person.<br/>
Yeah, in your head.<br/>
- "I'm a very appealing person. "<br/>
- "I'm a very appealing person. "<br/>
That woman can make a nun swear.<br/>
I'm graduating a year early so I can<br/>
be 3000 miles away in Princeton.<br/>
You could go to the University of Mars<br/>
and it still wouldn't be far enough.<br/>
Honey, I'm desperate.<br/>
- Can you cover that back booth?<br/>
- We're waiting.<br/>
- I don't think I can eat anything here.<br/>
- But...<br/>
I have the feeling I won't be able<br/>
to get a Zone meal here.<br/>
- I already ate.<br/>
- Laxatives don't qualify as a food group.<br/>
- Surprised you didn't know that.<br/>
- Stop it.<br/>
Well, if it isn't diner girl.<br/>
- What can I get you guys?<br/>
- What can I get here that has no sugar...<br/>
...no carbs and is fat-free?<br/>
- Water.<br/>
- Water? Feisty.<br/>
- Was that supposed to be a joke?<br/>
It was funny.<br/>
- I'll have a Voss.<br/>
- Excuse me?<br/>
- It's water. From Norway.<br/>
- She's the worst.<br/>
- Sorry, we only have water from the Valley.<br/>
- Oh, well, then I'll have an iced tea.<br/>
Make that two.<br/>
And I'm still waiting...<br/>
...on that breakfast burrito, diner girl.<br/>
- See you.<br/>
- Thank you.<br/>
- She is so not getting a tip.<br/>
Shelby, we really need to talk.<br/>
Privately.<br/>
Anything you say to me,<br/>
you can say in front of my peeps.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
I wanna break up.<br/>
What?<br/>
That was harsh.<br/>
- Are you in love with somebody else?<br/>
- I think so.<br/>
- No way.<br/>
- What? Who, bro?<br/>
I don't know.<br/>
- But we can still be...<br/>
- Don't say the word "friends. "<br/>
Fortunately for you, I'm gonna overlook<br/>
this mental breakdown of yours.<br/>
Look, just chill out. We're gonna go get<br/>
ready for the dance, and I'll see you there.<br/>
- Later.<br/>
- Late.<br/>
- That went well, bro.<br/>
- No, she took it well.<br/>
Good looking out.<br/>
- Later, diner girl.<br/>
- Too late.<br/>
Don't worry about it.<br/>
You know, those kids remind me<br/>
of why I used to fight in school.<br/>
Have no fear.<br/>
Zorro is here.<br/>
And he's got the keys<br/>
to his dad's Mercedes.<br/>
You're going dressed as a bus girl?<br/>
- Carter, I'm not going.<br/>
- What do you mean, you're not going?<br/>
- Okay, sorry. Sorry. What about cyberdude?<br/>
- Cyberdude?<br/>
That the boy that's been sending<br/>
you love notes?<br/>
They're not love notes. They're e-mails.<br/>
If a man is taking his time to write down<br/>
his feelings for you, it's a love note.<br/>
You've got a secret admirer.<br/>
And he wants to meet her tonight<br/>
at the dance.<br/>
- What are you still doing here?<br/>
- I'm obeying orders.<br/>
- Sam, this is your true love.<br/>
- Well, true love is gonna have to wait.<br/>
Oh, girl, please, save all that drama for the<br/>
soap operas. You are going to that dance.<br/>
Go ahead, girlfriend.<br/>
I can't go. Fiona would kill me and then<br/>
bring me back to clean up the mess.<br/>
She's gonna have to<br/>
go through me to hurt you.<br/>
- Go, girlfriend. Do your thing.<br/>
- Call me "girlfriend" one more time.<br/>
Okay, sorry.<br/>
Sam, your dad did not leave this earth<br/>
wanting you to be unhappy.<br/>
It's time for you to find your own bliss,<br/>
starting with this dance.<br/>
Sam, you need to listen to Rhonda.<br/>
You're always studying, always working.<br/>
Take some time for yourself.<br/>
Yeah, why don't you go out<br/>
and bust a move.<br/>
- Put your freak on.<br/>
- Whatever it is you kids do these days.<br/>
You know what? You guys are right.<br/>
I never do anything for myself.<br/>
- No, you don't.<br/>
- True.<br/>
And I deserve to have some fun.<br/>
- That's right.<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- I am gonna go to that dance.<br/>
- Okay, great.<br/>
And I am gonna meet my true love<br/>
and I'm gonna dance all night.<br/>
- I can't go.<br/>
- What?<br/>
I don't have a costume.<br/>
- But you will. Are you coming, Zorro?<br/>
- Yes, ma'am.<br/>
Vernon. Sam needs a costume.<br/>
No. No, Rhonda. I am closed.<br/>
Come on, I'll give you free breakfast<br/>
for a week.<br/>
Make it a month.<br/>
There's gotta be something here.<br/>
There is this one.<br/>
Perfect.<br/>
No way.<br/>
Hey, you're killing me here.<br/>
Aloha.<br/>
No, no. I got something.<br/>
Bless you.<br/>
Rhonda, this is hopeless.<br/>
Vernon, let me see that mask.<br/>
I don't have an outfit<br/>
that goes with that.<br/>
Yeah, but I do.<br/>
Rhonda, you sure do have a knack for taking<br/>
something simple and making it beautiful.<br/>
Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.<br/>
I was saving this dress for my<br/>
next attempt down the aisle.<br/>
Long story.<br/>
It's beautiful.<br/>
- Rhonda, I can't wear that.<br/>
- Yes, you can. And you will.<br/>
That dress has been in that box so long,<br/>
it deserves a night out.<br/>
Let's go.<br/>
This is gonna look so good on you.<br/>
Welcome, North Valley High School seniors<br/>
to the Halloween homecoming dance.<br/>
Tonight, our panel of esteemed teachers<br/>
will use their years of higher education...<br/>
...to choose our homecoming<br/>
prince and princess.<br/>
In true L.A. Fashion,<br/>
it's not about who you are.<br/>
It's about what you wear.<br/>
Are you ready to crank it up? Yeah.<br/>
I cannot believe I put you in charge<br/>
of costumes.<br/>
I told you Siamese cats,<br/>
not Siamese twins.<br/>
Are we having a catfight?<br/>
- Welcome, guys.<br/>
- What up?<br/>
- Sorry about your costume getting lost.<br/>
- It's all good.<br/>
No, it's not. We don't get to be<br/>
the Three Musketeers.<br/>
You get to be Prince Charming<br/>
and we're the two wimps in wigs.<br/>
Take the cape off already.<br/>
You look amazing.<br/>
- I'm sorry, I'm just freaking out here.<br/>
- Listen, it's gonna be okay.<br/>
- Hurry up, it's almost 11.<br/>
- Carter, wait.<br/>
Remember, I have to be back<br/>
in the diner by 12, okay?<br/>
Okay, give me your cell phone.<br/>
Come on, cell phone.<br/>
Okay. All right, I'm going to set the alarm<br/>
for a quarter to 12, okay?<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
- All right, there. Now, give me the cape.<br/>
Come on, it's time<br/>
Sam, what are they all staring at?<br/>
Love her dress. Hate her.<br/>
Sam, don't worry, okay?<br/>
Any guy would have to be completely<br/>
insane not to like you, all right?<br/>
I'm just gonna be standing<br/>
right over here. Okay.<br/>
Do you know you're standing precisely<br/>
in the middle of the dance floor?<br/>
Fate has brought us together right here<br/>
at this anointed hour...<br/>
...under the shimmering disco ball.<br/>
Terry.<br/>
- Are you Nomad?<br/>
- Nomad?<br/>
Indeed. I have traveled through time<br/>
and space to find you.<br/>
Now join me in the<br/>
mating dance of Zion.<br/>
Terry, that's nice.<br/>
Hey, I know that girl from somewhere.<br/>
- I'm thirsty. I gotta get some punch...<br/>
- Some libations for the fair maiden?<br/>
Your wish is my command.<br/>
I knew this was too good to be true.<br/>
Princeton Girl?<br/>
Austin Ames?<br/>
- You're Nomad?<br/>
- Yeah, I guess my costume doesn't do...<br/>
...a very good job at hiding who I am.<br/>
- No, I know exactly who you are.<br/>
I'm sorry. This was a really big mistake.<br/>
I've gotta go.<br/>
Wait. Wait.<br/>
Wait. It's not a mistake.<br/>
- Don't you know who I am?<br/>
- Of course I do. You're Princeton Girl.<br/>
You're the girl I've been waiting to meet.<br/>
I know who you are.<br/>
What's your name?<br/>
Your sweet libations, my lady.<br/>
Mr. Anderson.<br/>
Austin Ames with my lady.<br/>
A devastating blow.<br/>
A worthy opponent.<br/>
- What about your girlfriend?<br/>
- It's over.<br/>
I guess you were expecting some guy<br/>
who hangs out at Starbucks...<br/>
...and writes poetry.<br/>
- Something like that.<br/>
Come on, you're Austin Ames.<br/>
You're football captain<br/>
and student body president.<br/>
And closet poet?<br/>
You can't be both guys.<br/>
- I'm not.<br/>
- Then who are you?<br/>
On September 7th, I wrote you:<br/>
"I live in a world full of people pretending<br/>
to be something they're not.<br/>
- But when I talk to you... "<br/>
- "I'm the guy I wanna be. "<br/>
Give me a chance to be that guy.<br/>
Do you want to join me<br/>
for a stroll outside?<br/>
If you wanna be voted homecoming prince,<br/>
you'd better stay inside.<br/>
I really don't care about becoming<br/>
homecoming prince.<br/>
So, Princeton Girl, would you tell me<br/>
who you are if I guessed it right?<br/>
- Maybe.<br/>
- Maybe?<br/>
- Well, how about we play 20 questions.<br/>
- How about 10.<br/>
I'll take what I can get.<br/>
Okay, first question.<br/>
You do actually go to<br/>
North Valley High School, right?<br/>
- Of course.<br/>
- Look, I'm just checking.<br/>
I mean, you never know<br/>
with the Internet.<br/>
Okay, next question.<br/>
Were you disappointed when you<br/>
found out that I was Nomad?<br/>
- Be honest.<br/>
- Surprisingly, no.<br/>
Did you vote for me for<br/>
student body president?<br/>
- Surprisingly, yes.<br/>
- Really?<br/>
Okay, I got it. Given the choice...<br/>
...would you rather have a rice cake<br/>
or a Big Mac?<br/>
- A Big Mac. But what does that matter?<br/>
- Well, I like a girl with a hearty appetite.<br/>
And besides, you just eliminated about<br/>
You'd think I'd remember those eyes.<br/>
You're so beautiful.<br/>
Next question.<br/>
What's up, girl?<br/>
- What are you supposed to be?<br/>
- A Three Musketeer.<br/>
- You don't look like a candy bar.<br/>
- Right.<br/>
Look, now that you<br/>
and Austin are toast...<br/>
...okay, why don't we<br/>
have our own little party.<br/>
- Back off, David.<br/>
- Come on, Shelby. I know you like me.<br/>
- No. Stop it. No.<br/>
- I know... I know it.<br/>
- No, stop it. Stop.<br/>
- Come on.<br/>
The lady said, "Stop. "<br/>
- Oh, yeah?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- Give me that!<br/>
- Oh, God.<br/>
I just saw your life flash<br/>
before your eyes.<br/>
Oh, yeah? Well, did you see the part<br/>
where I run away?<br/>
- That was awesome.<br/>
- Oh, you're dead, taco boy!<br/>
Ladies.<br/>
- You're mine!<br/>
- Move over, please.<br/>
- It's over, dude.<br/>
- Oh, yeah?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- Well, I hate to tell you this, dude...<br/>
...but I starred in Pirates of Penzance<br/>
three times.<br/>
- Oh, yeah?<br/>
- Say hello to act two, scene one.<br/>
If I ask you to dance,<br/>
does that count as a question?<br/>
There's no music.<br/>
So?<br/>
All out of questions?<br/>
Do you believe in love at first sight?<br/>
I'll let you know.<br/>
- But I've seen you before?<br/>
- Yes.<br/>
Man. How could I have<br/>
seen you before...<br/>
...and not know who you are now?<br/>
Maybe you were looking,<br/>
but you weren't really seeing.<br/>
- You've got one more question left.<br/>
- Okay.<br/>
Do you, Princeton Girl...<br/>
...feel like you made the right choice<br/>
meeting me here tonight?<br/>
I do.<br/>
And do you, Austin Ames,<br/>
ever wanna see me again after tonight?<br/>
I'd have to think about that.<br/>
Absolutely.<br/>
Not now.<br/>
- What?<br/>
- I've gotta go.<br/>
- You have a curfew or something?<br/>
- Something like that.<br/>
I'm sorry, but thank you.<br/>
This has been the most amazing night.<br/>
- Where are you going?<br/>
- I'm late.<br/>
- For what?<br/>
- Reality.<br/>
I was right in the middle<br/>
of a power jam.<br/>
- You totally harshed my mellow.<br/>
- You'll get over it and live.<br/>
Hello! It is almost midnight.<br/>
And that means it's time to announce<br/>
who we have selected...<br/>
- What's up?<br/>
- Have you seen the girl I was with?<br/>
No, I haven't seen her,<br/>
but you missed it.<br/>
I beat some kid's butt. It was crazy.<br/>
Now, the moment you've<br/>
all been waiting for.<br/>
- Carter? Carter. Carter, come on.<br/>
- Your new North Valley High...<br/>
...homecoming prince and princess...<br/>
- I'm gonna be late.<br/>
... are Prince Charming and Cinderella!<br/>
It's you, bro. It's you.<br/>
My dear, I must bid you adieu.<br/>
I'm sorry.<br/>
- A what?<br/>
- I gotta go. I'm sorry.<br/>
Hurry up!<br/>
Bravo! There he is, bravo! Looks like<br/>
Cinderella is playing hard to get.<br/>
- I almost kissed Austin Ames!<br/>
- I totally, totally kissed Shelby Cummings!<br/>
Wait, so, what...? What did he say<br/>
when he found out that you were you?<br/>
He didn't say, because he didn't find out.<br/>
You didn't tell him? Why not?<br/>
Carter, I live in an attic, okay?<br/>
I drive a beat-up old car,<br/>
and he's expecting Malibu Barbie.<br/>
I'll be doing him a favor<br/>
if I just disappear.<br/>
- Shotgun.<br/>
- Oh, no, I'm shotgun.<br/>
- Get in already.<br/>
- Stop pulling.<br/>
Where are your crowns?<br/>
Where are your prizes?<br/>
- Winners get prizes.<br/>
- We didn't win, Mom.<br/>
Some girl stole it from us.<br/>
I am very, very, very, very upset<br/>
about this.<br/>
- You don't look upset.<br/>
- It's the Botox.<br/>
I can't show emotion<br/>
for another hour and a half.<br/>
- I told you she wanted me bad.<br/>
- Carter, just drive.<br/>
- Spam?<br/>
- Spam?<br/>
Mom!<br/>
- It's Sam! Over there.<br/>
- Over there.<br/>
Hi, Mrs. Montgomery.<br/>
- Mom, she was there. She's in the car.<br/>
- We saw her, Mom.<br/>
That's ridiculous.<br/>
She's working tonight.<br/>
- She would never disobey me.<br/>
- She was there.<br/>
- She was with him.<br/>
- In the car.<br/>
- I saw...<br/>
- Shut your cat face.<br/>
- Did they see me?<br/>
- No, I don't think so...<br/>
...but the wannabe Olsen twins<br/>
might have.<br/>
I know you wanna take care of this car,<br/>
but can you step on it?<br/>
In case you haven't noticed, I'm already<br/>
going 38 in a 35-mile zone, Sam...<br/>
...so can you just lay off, please?<br/>
Come on, catch up to them.<br/>
Will you speed up? We've got to<br/>
beat Sam back to the diner.<br/>
Shut up, girls. We'll be back<br/>
at the diner soon enough.<br/>
Soon enough isn't soon enough!<br/>
What are you doing?<br/>
Take your paw off the gas!<br/>
I can't. It's stuck!<br/>
Go, go.<br/>
Carter, you could've totally<br/>
made that light.<br/>
FYI, Sam, yellow means slow down,<br/>
okay? Not speed up.<br/>
I need The Fast and the Furious,<br/>
not Driving Miss Daisy.<br/>
We're gonna die!<br/>
Was that...?<br/>
- Mother, stop!<br/>
- We're gonna die!<br/>
I think I need to use the litter box.<br/>
Oh, my God. My face is back.<br/>
- I told you she wasn't here.<br/>
- No dope.<br/>
- Where is Sam?<br/>
- What do you mean, where is Sam?<br/>
- Where do you think she is?<br/>
- She better be here.<br/>
Fiona, I was gonna talk to you about<br/>
something that I really... Fiona, wait!<br/>
I want my breasts done.<br/>
Where did you get those?<br/>
San Diego. Excuse me.<br/>
Did you notice how shiny the floors<br/>
are since we switched to Mr. Clean?<br/>
What are you, a commercial? Click.<br/>
Oh, mommy, oh.<br/>
Fiona, I'm so glad you're here,<br/>
because...<br/>
The fish. Nemo is no more. Smell.<br/>
- There is a tear in one of the booths.<br/>
- We were gonna tell you.<br/>
What am I supposed to do<br/>
with a dead fish?<br/>
Everyone, shut up!<br/>
When I find her, I'm gonna wring her...<br/>
Order's up.<br/>
- Sam. What are you doing back there?<br/>
- Just working on my cooking skills.<br/>
Yeah, I was teaching her to make<br/>
pancakes with salmon.<br/>
How was the dance, girls?<br/>
You know, something stinks<br/>
around here.<br/>
And it's not the fish.<br/>
You're gonna get it. Come on, girls.<br/>
We made it, and not a scratch.<br/>
- Girls, come on.<br/>
- You bit me, you dumb face.<br/>
Car smells like bad cheese.<br/>
- Don't put your dirty paws all over me.<br/>
- Pushing me.<br/>
What is he doing here?<br/>
Tonight must be my lucky night.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
Mrs. Montgomery...<br/>
...your sign hit my...<br/>
...car.<br/>
- Gozaimasu, Fighting Frogs.<br/>
Here's your daily drought reminder:<br/>
Only flush for number two.<br/>
Austin Ames was crowned prince<br/>
of the homecoming dance.<br/>
Big shocker there.<br/>
Didn't see that one coming.<br/>
But the real mystery, though,<br/>
is who was his princess?<br/>
- How long are you grounded for?<br/>
- Well, how long is forever?<br/>
- So you're not gonna tell Austin?<br/>
- Come on, Carter.<br/>
It's not like he'll pine for me. Trust me,<br/>
he's forgotten all about Cinderella by now.<br/>
Yeah, he's obviously forgotten<br/>
all about you.<br/>
Dude, why are you going through<br/>
all this trouble for one chick?<br/>
Look, she's not just some chick, all right?<br/>
She was real.<br/>
- Real. Like, she still had her old nose.<br/>
- No, real.<br/>
A girl who has more on her mind<br/>
than what she wears...<br/>
...or how much weight<br/>
she wants to lose.<br/>
- She listens to me.<br/>
- Listens to you?<br/>
Hey, brother, I listen to you, okay?<br/>
I feel your pai...<br/>
- Hello, kitty.<br/>
- Yeah, you're a great listener.<br/>
- Well...<br/>
- Look, man, you found her cell phone.<br/>
- You just gotta get some clue from that.<br/>
- The phone's locked.<br/>
I keep getting messages like, "I need you,"<br/>
and, "Come see me now. "<br/>
- Oh, dude, it's so hot.<br/>
- See, that's what I thought.<br/>
- Until I got one that said, "Come fix fryer. "<br/>
- Oh, dude, that's hot and kinky, baby.<br/>
You know what I'm saying? Can I get one?<br/>
Let me get a pound, baby.<br/>
He's looking for you everywhere.<br/>
Tell him it was you.<br/>
Isn't it better to cling<br/>
to what might've been...<br/>
...instead of ruining everything<br/>
with reality?<br/>
- You can't hide from him forever.<br/>
- Not forever.<br/>
Just until graduation, when I leave<br/>
this place and never see him again.<br/>
Okay, so, what about you, Zorro?<br/>
When are you gonna tell Shelby?<br/>
Well, I've been thinking about doing<br/>
just that, as a matter of fact.<br/>
Right. Okay, so the day you tell Shelby<br/>
it was you, I'll tell Austin it was me.<br/>
- Deal.<br/>
- Deal.<br/>
Look in the yearbook again.<br/>
- Maybe she's foreign exchange. That's hot.<br/>
- Totally. That's, like... That's, like, le hot.<br/>
Look, there's no way I missed her.<br/>
I mean, we had a connection.<br/>
- Thanks.<br/>
- Jeez, are you okay?<br/>
Keep your legs straight.<br/>
Straighter, straighter.<br/>
What are you doing? Brianna!<br/>
After the flip, it's the butterfly rollover.<br/>
- No, it's not. It's mermaid plunge!<br/>
- Yes!<br/>
Oh, my God. I cannot wait<br/>
for my solo career!<br/>
When are we going solo?<br/>
He was so mysterious,<br/>
but really obvious at the same time.<br/>
I mean, kind of dangerous, but very safe.<br/>
And wild, but tame.<br/>
I'm gonna go change.<br/>
I cannot believe you're gonna tell Shelby<br/>
it was you.<br/>
Sam, once she realizes that she's found<br/>
her Zorro, okay, she'll be thrilled.<br/>
- Now, watch and learn.<br/>
- Good luck.<br/>
- And, oh, my God, when I kissed him, I...<br/>
- Enough already.<br/>
Madison, I think somebody's got a green<br/>
monster on their back called Mr. Jealousy.<br/>
- Shelby, baby, what's up?<br/>
- And you are?<br/>
Yeah. Allow me to refresh your memory.<br/>
- Zorro.<br/>
- You mean zero.<br/>
- Who is he?<br/>
- That's Carter Farrell.<br/>
He's the guy you cheat off<br/>
of in Algebra II.<br/>
The freak who hums show tunes?<br/>
- I'm in front.<br/>
- Quit it.<br/>
Sorry.<br/>
- Let me in the front.<br/>
- Listen.<br/>
Last night I had a very bad cold,<br/>
and I drank a whole bottle of NyQuil.<br/>
- I just wasn't myself.<br/>
- But I thought we had, like, a connection.<br/>
Okay. We don't have anything.<br/>
We are from completely different classes<br/>
of human.<br/>
Let's go back to our usual lives,<br/>
where we only mingle...<br/>
...when I copy you in Algebra II, okay?<br/>
- "Okay?"<br/>
- We didn't rehearse it!<br/>
Was that good?<br/>
You all right?<br/>
If she thinks she's still cheating off me,<br/>
she's crazy.<br/>
- Guys, I don't know about this.<br/>
- Come on.<br/>
- Just trust us.<br/>
- We asked every girl...<br/>
...if they were with you at the dance.<br/>
These said yes.<br/>
- Oh, no. No, no, no.<br/>
- Austin! Introduce me on the cell phone.<br/>
- Guys, come on.<br/>
- Sit down here.<br/>
Okay! Austin Ames!<br/>
Let's bring out bachelorette number one!<br/>
She's a transfer from Woodland Hills,<br/>
enjoys collecting puka shells...<br/>
...long walks on the beach<br/>
and getting tubed.<br/>
Pleased to meet you, Missy!<br/>
- What's up, Austin?<br/>
- Thanks for coming, Missy.<br/>
- See you, dude.<br/>
- You're dead.<br/>
Okay, okay, let's bring out<br/>
bachelorette number two!<br/>
This little filly's into barbells...<br/>
...World War II and protein shakes.<br/>
Here's Helga.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
You are so dead.<br/>
- Okay, okay, next up is...<br/>
- Enough, enough. Guys, come on.<br/>
Look, you're beautiful, okay?<br/>
But I'm not your prince.<br/>
- You'll meet him someday, but it's not me.<br/>
- Thanks, Austin.<br/>
- Late entry.<br/>
- David, you stop it right now.<br/>
You're a bad boy,<br/>
and that is a terrible shirt.<br/>
Everybody, back to your class.<br/>
Hi, Ryan.<br/>
That's not fair!<br/>
Don't want that, don't want that,<br/>
don't want that, don't want that.<br/>
Accepted? Oh, this won't do.<br/>
- Hey. Anything in the mail for me?<br/>
- Oh, actually...<br/>
...there's a personalized letter here<br/>
from Ed McMahon...<br/>
...saying you just won a million dollars.<br/>
Don't spend it all in one place.<br/>
I need to know who you are.<br/>
I can't take my mind off you.<br/>
Please tell me who you are.<br/>
Okay.<br/>
- My name is...<br/>
- Sam!<br/>
- You missed the "Do Not Disturb" sign.<br/>
- No, I saw it.<br/>
So you almost done with my report?<br/>
It's due Friday.<br/>
- I'm working on it.<br/>
- Well, hurry up.<br/>
It makes me nervous<br/>
to have to wait for it.<br/>
Imagine how nervous you'd be<br/>
if you actually had to write it.<br/>
My God, you're right.<br/>
So this time, could you try<br/>
to make it sound more like me?<br/>
I'm so sick of having to explain<br/>
why I sound so smart on paper...<br/>
...and so not smart not on paper.<br/>
- Sam? Can you come downstairs?<br/>
- I'll be right there.<br/>
Now!<br/>
I'll be right back.<br/>
Hurry up.<br/>
Who the heck is Nomad?<br/>
"Cinderella, are you not talking to me<br/>
because you freaked...<br/>
...when you found out I'm...<br/>
...Austin Ames?"<br/>
Sam is Cinderella?<br/>
- I got in.<br/>
- Austin!<br/>
- Austin.<br/>
- What?<br/>
What's going on?<br/>
Nothing.<br/>
Let me guess. You're thinking,<br/>
"Is USC really the right choice for me?"<br/>
Well, yeah. I've been thinking<br/>
a lot about this and...<br/>
Don't worry about it. You're making<br/>
the right choice, all right?<br/>
Okay.<br/>
It's me, Austin. It's Cinderella,<br/>
from the dance.<br/>
Oh, you found me.<br/>
Oh, no.<br/>
"You see, Austin, I live in this world... "<br/>
Full of people pretending<br/>
to be something they're not.<br/>
- Pretending...<br/>
- "I miss you. I don't want... "<br/>
I got it.<br/>
- How are you doing?<br/>
- Good.<br/>
- Regular wash?<br/>
- No, more like the royal treatment.<br/>
I mean, that's what Cinderella<br/>
would want.<br/>
- What did you just say?<br/>
- I'm her, Austin.<br/>
I'm Cinderella, your dream girl.<br/>
- You see, I live in a world full of...<br/>
- You.<br/>
What are you doing here?<br/>
I'm Cinderella,<br/>
coming to meet my prince.<br/>
That's a little hard,<br/>
considering I'm Cinderella.<br/>
I mean, I'm the most "Cinderelly"<br/>
Cinderella there ever was.<br/>
Ladies, ladies, ladies.<br/>
Look, I can settle this, all right?<br/>
The girl that I met at the dance,<br/>
she dropped something on her way out.<br/>
- What was it?<br/>
- Oh, that's easy.<br/>
- A wallet.<br/>
- No.<br/>
- I meant a wallet-purse.<br/>
- No.<br/>
A fish.<br/>
- A fish?<br/>
- It was the first thing...<br/>
...that popped into my head.<br/>
You said, "wallet-purse. " What's that?<br/>
- Austin?<br/>
- Well.<br/>
Look what you did. See?<br/>
You always ruin everything.<br/>
I was supposed to be Cinderella.<br/>
I'm the oldest.<br/>
By a minute and 26 seconds.<br/>
And you never let me forget it!<br/>
- Well, maybe this will help you remember.<br/>
- No.<br/>
Come here!<br/>
You're dead. I'm gonna kill you!<br/>
Bri?<br/>
Oh, I'm gonna kill you! Get off!<br/>
- That's what you get for stealing my idea!<br/>
- Hey, Dad, isn't that our car?<br/>
- I hate you!<br/>
- I hate you!<br/>
- Oh, no!<br/>
- Not the...<br/>
- Hot wax!<br/>
- Hot wax!<br/>
Thank you. Have a good night.<br/>
- Bobby, can I get two BLT's?<br/>
- It's coming.<br/>
That's him.<br/>
- That's good. Go over.<br/>
- No.<br/>
Hey.<br/>
Can I get you something?<br/>
Do you know what bugs me?<br/>
- People taking your order?<br/>
- No.<br/>
Taking people's orders.<br/>
- Why would you do that?<br/>
- You don't know my dad.<br/>
Sushi and doughnuts? Who does that?<br/>
- I'll take a coffee. Thank you.<br/>
- Excuse me, miss?<br/>
Do you ever feel like if you show<br/>
someone who you really are...<br/>
...they won't accept you?<br/>
Yeah. I do.<br/>
Like being yourself isn't good enough.<br/>
- Right.<br/>
- Like you're wearing a mask.<br/>
That's exactly how I feel.<br/>
You just wanna be honest with this person<br/>
and tell them, "It's me.<br/>
I'm the one that you've<br/>
been looking for. "<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
Austin...<br/>
...I'm...<br/>
- Sam!<br/>
- One second.<br/>
- No, now.<br/>
No, it's cool, I gotta bounce.<br/>
Oh, great, thank you so much.<br/>
Thank you very much, Sam.<br/>
You're welcome.<br/>
Bonjour, Fighting Frogs.<br/>
Here's your daily drought reminder:<br/>
Don't hose your lawn, your car,<br/>
or anybody else, for that matter.<br/>
And remember, tickets<br/>
for the big game go on sale...<br/>
And then she told us that she was<br/>
going to try to steal...<br/>
...Austin away from you<br/>
if that was the last thing she did.<br/>
Our stepsister has always been<br/>
jealous of you.<br/>
Go on.<br/>
Well, that's when she invented<br/>
this whole Cinderella plot.<br/>
She got ahold of Austin's<br/>
e- mail address...<br/>
...and that's when she<br/>
started the whole affair.<br/>
We wanted to tell you sooner,<br/>
but she threatened to kill us.<br/>
She's such a monster.<br/>
Look, if you don't believe us,<br/>
look at the e-mails.<br/>
She goes by Princeton Girl 818,<br/>
but her real name is Sam Montgomery.<br/>
And we're Brianna and Gabriella.<br/>
So that little boyfriend stealer<br/>
thinks she can pull a fast one on me?<br/>
Well, we'll just see about that.<br/>
Austin was really late today and asked me<br/>
if you'd read this announcement.<br/>
"Cinderella...<br/>
...if you're listening, your prince wants to<br/>
rendezvous with you after the pep rally. "<br/>
Nothing like a pep rally<br/>
to warm up our prince.<br/>
Carter! I talked to him.<br/>
And not as Cinderella.<br/>
I talked to him as me, Sam,<br/>
and he didn't hate me.<br/>
So you told him everything?<br/>
No, not everything. Not the part<br/>
about me being Cinderella.<br/>
But I'm gonna go tell him right after<br/>
the pep rally. You coming, cowboy?<br/>
- So you think I look like a real cowboy?<br/>
- Sure.<br/>
- Who we gonna beat?<br/>
- The Lancers!<br/>
- And when we gonna beat them?<br/>
- Friday!<br/>
Good news. I just got off<br/>
the phone with Hank Cole.<br/>
You play well on Friday, and your future<br/>
is set at USC football.<br/>
That's great, Dad.<br/>
And who's gonna lead us to victory?<br/>
- Austin!<br/>
- I can't hear you!<br/>
- Kill the Lancers!<br/>
- Austin!<br/>
The cheerleaders have put together<br/>
a skit to help get us in the spirit.<br/>
I love you, Shelby!<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
"Once upon a time, there was<br/>
a big, strong Fighting Frog.<br/>
He had a beautiful girlfriend, and his dad<br/>
owned the biggest pond in all the land.<br/>
But he still wasn't happy.<br/>
If only he can find a princess,<br/>
then she could kiss him...<br/>
...turn him into a prince,<br/>
and they would run away together.<br/>
One night, after the slimy frog<br/>
ditches his super-hot...<br/>
...senior-poll-most-popular girlfriend,<br/>
he meets his princess. "<br/>
Your highness.<br/>
"Alas, it turned out that our frog<br/>
not only had a secret identity...<br/>
...but also had a secret e-mail relationship<br/>
with a pen pal named Princeton Girl. "<br/>
This isn't good.<br/>
Dear Princeton Girl, I can't wait<br/>
till we finally get to meet.<br/>
You're the only one<br/>
who understands the real me.<br/>
The man who doesn't want<br/>
to play USC football.<br/>
But who wants to be at Princeton,<br/>
with you.<br/>
- What are they talking about?<br/>
- Nothing.<br/>
Dear Nomad, I want you to know<br/>
who I am, but I'm scared!<br/>
I'm scared that you'll reject me.<br/>
And I've never had a real kiss before.<br/>
- I can't believe they're reading my e-mails.<br/>
- Let's go.<br/>
But our princess had a secret too.<br/>
She wasn't royalty at all, but a geek,<br/>
a loser, a servant girl.<br/>
Yeah!<br/>
Any ideas about this?<br/>
And who, may you ask, is this imposter?<br/>
Give it up for the pretend princess,<br/>
diner girl, Sam Montgomery!<br/>
Diner girl! Diner girl!<br/>
Diner girl! Diner girl!<br/>
Come on.<br/>
- Sam!<br/>
- Go away!<br/>
But, Sam, you've got a letter<br/>
from Princeton.<br/>
What does it say?<br/>
I didn't get in.<br/>
Oh, no!<br/>
And you studied so hard.<br/>
I can't believe I actually thought<br/>
I had a chance.<br/>
Sam, I'm heartbroken.<br/>
Life can be so unfair.<br/>
Well, just look at the bright side.<br/>
You have a job at the diner<br/>
for the rest of your life.<br/>
You want a cookie?<br/>
They're so moist.<br/>
People like her don't belong<br/>
in our world, Austin.<br/>
Sam, what are you doing?<br/>
I'm trying to get these floors clean.<br/>
Come on, sweetie, get up.<br/>
What I meant is, what are you<br/>
doing with your life?<br/>
I'm diner girl. I'm doing what<br/>
diner girls do, Rhonda.<br/>
Baby, what's gotten into you? You don't<br/>
even realize how blessed you are.<br/>
Look, you've got a whole family<br/>
behind you.<br/>
We have faith in you.<br/>
And you gotta have faith in yourself.<br/>
Mother!<br/>
- Sam just ruined your wall.<br/>
- What?<br/>
Yes, you did. Well, that's gonna come<br/>
out of your paycheck.<br/>
And cover up those stupid words.<br/>
"Never let the fear of striking out<br/>
keep you from playing the game. "<br/>
All right. I'm going off to<br/>
get some more lipo.<br/>
Come on, girls. Sam, I need you<br/>
to clean the pool tonight.<br/>
No.<br/>
Excuse me?<br/>
You heard me. I quit.<br/>
I quit this job. I quit your family.<br/>
And I'm moving out.<br/>
Oh, and where are you gonna live?<br/>
With me.<br/>
You can't just walk out on me.<br/>
You know what, Fiona?<br/>
You can mess with your hair,<br/>
your nose and your face...<br/>
...and you can even mess<br/>
with my dad's diner.<br/>
But you're through messing with me.<br/>
Wait up, Sam.<br/>
You take one more step, and you're fired.<br/>
Oh, no, that won't be necessary,<br/>
because I quit too. And you know what?<br/>
The only reason why I put up with<br/>
you all these years is because of that girl.<br/>
Now that she's free of you, nothing<br/>
is stopping me from kicking your butt.<br/>
Come on, no. Not my face. It's much<br/>
newer than the girls. Go for the girls!<br/>
- Mom!<br/>
- Rhonda? Rhonda!<br/>
She's not even worth it.<br/>
- You're right.<br/>
- You know what? I quit too.<br/>
Me too. Hey, Rhonda. Eleanor.<br/>
Hold up, I need a ride.<br/>
See you.<br/>
Well...<br/>
See you.<br/>
Send me a bill.<br/>
Fiona actually thought<br/>
you were gonna slug her.<br/>
I was gonna do more than that.<br/>
I had no idea that you were that tough.<br/>
Yeah, but I always knew that you were.<br/>
Rhonda...<br/>
...are you sure that this is okay?<br/>
Sam, I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/>
I haven't felt this much at home<br/>
in such a long time.<br/>
I'm sure, compared<br/>
to the Addams Family.<br/>
- What's on your mind?<br/>
- I gotta do something tonight.<br/>
Don't wait up for me, okay?<br/>
Welcome to the start of tonight's game<br/>
between the South Bay Lancers...<br/>
...and the North Valley Fighting Frogs!<br/>
Big welcome to all returning alumni to<br/>
tonight's 38th annual homecoming game!<br/>
- Check it!<br/>
- Chick at 3 o'clock!<br/>
- Hey, diner girl!<br/>
- What's she doing in here?<br/>
What are you doing in here?<br/>
Sam.<br/>
- Okay, I know you think I'm just some...<br/>
- Coward? Phony?<br/>
- Okay, just listen.<br/>
- No, you listen.<br/>
You turned out to be exactly<br/>
who I thought you were.<br/>
I never pretended to be somebody else.<br/>
It's been me all along.<br/>
And it was me who was hurt<br/>
in front of everybody.<br/>
Look, I didn't come here<br/>
to yell at you, okay?<br/>
I came to tell you I know what it feels<br/>
like to be afraid to show who you are.<br/>
I was. But I'm not anymore.<br/>
And the thing is, I don't care<br/>
what people think about me...<br/>
...because I believe in myself.<br/>
And I know that things are gonna be okay.<br/>
But even though I have no family<br/>
and no job and no money for college...<br/>
...it's you that I feel sorry for.<br/>
- Heads up. Yo, five minutes.<br/>
- I'm coming.<br/>
I know that guy that sent those e-mails<br/>
is somewhere down inside of you.<br/>
But I can't wait for him...<br/>
...because waiting for you is like<br/>
waiting for rain in this drought.<br/>
Useless and disappointing.<br/>
Sam.<br/>
- Sam.<br/>
- Hey. What are you doing here?<br/>
Rhonda told me where you might be. I<br/>
thought you could use a friend. Come here.<br/>
Sam, I'm so proud of you.<br/>
You did...<br/>
Your stepmom and Austin,<br/>
all in one day. How do you feel?<br/>
I'll let you know when I can catch<br/>
my breath. Let's do something tonight.<br/>
Well, I was actually thinking<br/>
about going to the game...<br/>
...but I understand<br/>
if you don't wanna do that.<br/>
No, I'll go.<br/>
Really? You'll go to the game?<br/>
Yeah. I can handle it now.<br/>
It'll be our first and last.<br/>
And besides, if I don't go, who else<br/>
is gonna explain the game to you?<br/>
I like what you're wearing.<br/>
What character are you today?<br/>
- Myself.<br/>
- I think it's your best look.<br/>
Thank you.<br/>
Come on, everybody. Weren't they great?<br/>
Let's hear it for them.<br/>
Let's give our cheerleaders a big hand.<br/>
Make some noise.<br/>
Austin and I are almost back together.<br/>
It isn't official or anything, but it's on.<br/>
- Sorry, guys.<br/>
- Sorry.<br/>
Okay, everybody. Get ready.<br/>
Here they come!<br/>
I'm glad you came, Sam.<br/>
The defending regional conference<br/>
champions, your very own Fighting Frogs!<br/>
Both the Lancers and the Frogs<br/>
enter the game...<br/>
...tied for the lead in the<br/>
conference standings.<br/>
The winner of tonight's game will advance<br/>
to the playoffs for the state championship.<br/>
Austin.<br/>
Austin. All right, buddy.<br/>
This is the big one, all right?<br/>
You stay focused and win it.<br/>
- Everyone is counting on you. All right?<br/>
- Andy!<br/>
Hey, Chuck! How you doing, pal?<br/>
Let's do it again! One more time.<br/>
Down, set, 28 guarding, 28 guarding!<br/>
Hike!<br/>
The clock is stopped with nine seconds<br/>
left in the game.<br/>
- The Frogs need one touchdown to win.<br/>
- I love football! I love football!<br/>
I love football!<br/>
Austin! Austin! Austin!<br/>
Austin! Austin!<br/>
Carter, I thought that I could handle this,<br/>
but I really can't. I'm gonna go.<br/>
You know what? I'll tell you<br/>
how it ends, okay?<br/>
- Come on!<br/>
- Do it, baby!<br/>
This is the one. This is the one, Austin.<br/>
This is the one.<br/>
- Sorry, boys.<br/>
- Where are you going?<br/>
What's he...? What is he...?<br/>
What's the problem?<br/>
- What are you doing?<br/>
- I'm out of here.<br/>
What? You're throwing away your dream!<br/>
No, Dad. I'm throwing away yours.<br/>
It's your game now. Go get them.<br/>
Substituting for Ames is number 23,<br/>
Ryan Henson.<br/>
- Austin!<br/>
- Austin! Get back here!<br/>
Austin, what are you doing?<br/>
Something I should've done<br/>
a long time ago.<br/>
Sorry I waited for the rain.<br/>
It's okay.<br/>
No!<br/>
Oh, my God.<br/>
Touchdown! The Fighting Frogs have won.<br/>
They've done it. They won the game.<br/>
Oh, my... You gotta<br/>
love high school.<br/>
So we won the big game that day.<br/>
But what I remember most<br/>
was I got my prince.<br/>
And a really bad cold.<br/>
After that, it was like everything<br/>
fell into place.<br/>
My dad was right. The fairy tale book<br/>
did contain something important.<br/>
Take this one and take the<br/>
two cars in the front.<br/>
I can pay for those parking tickets!<br/>
Actually, I'm selling your cars, Fiona.<br/>
For college tuition money.<br/>
What gives you the idea<br/>
you can sell our cars?<br/>
- She owns them.<br/>
- Exactly. I own them.<br/>
I'm the county district attorney.<br/>
Have you ever seen this before?<br/>
I've never seen that before.<br/>
Isn't this your signature<br/>
on the witness line?<br/>
I have never seen my<br/>
husband's hidden will before.<br/>
I'm afraid you're gonna have to come<br/>
downtown with me, ma'am.<br/>
That hidden will stated that the house,<br/>
the diner and everything belonged to me.<br/>
It turned out my stepsisters knew where<br/>
Fiona had filed my real acceptance letter.<br/>
I got it!<br/>
My dad's diner was restored<br/>
to its former glory.<br/>
And my stepmother<br/>
made a deal with the DA.<br/>
She's working off her debt<br/>
to society at Hal's...<br/>
...under the watchful eye<br/>
of my new partner.<br/>
And my stepsisters? They finally put<br/>
their teamwork to good use.<br/>
Austin's dad finally came around<br/>
and got off his Trojan horse.<br/>
Things even cleared up for Carter.<br/>
Anything is possible if you just believe.<br/>
He ended up filming a commercial.<br/>
And in addition to<br/>
landing that commercial...<br/>
...Carter also landed the girl.<br/>
The San Fernando Valley<br/>
was clear and beautiful...<br/>
...the way it only is after a big rainstorm.<br/>
As for Austin and me, well,<br/>
I finally got my cell phone back.<br/>
We wound up going to Princeton together<br/>
and lived happily ever after.<br/>
At least for now.<br/>
Hey, I'm only a freshman.
