Ladies and gentlemen,
<br/>
we are here today to celebrate the union
of two very special individuals.
<br/>
Two souls that shall become one
and shine only more brightly together.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I can't believe this day is here.
- Won't you please join me
<br/>
in bringing together in marriage
a much beloved couple...
<br/>
Chloe and Papi.
<br/>
- Oh, Papi.
- Chihuahua.
<br/>
I'm just so happy for them.
<br/>
- Me, too.
- Always a bridesmaid, never a bride.
<br/>
You may all be seated.
<br/>
Sit.
<br/>
Chloe and Papi, do you take
each other to love and honour
<br/>
in good times and bad,
in wet nose and dry nose,
<br/>
as long as you both shall live?
<br/>
- I do.
- I do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
<br/>
You may lick the bride.
<br/>
A toast to the newlyweds.
<br/>
They're perfect together,
like Romeo and Juliet.
<br/>
- Or Dolce &amp; Gabbana.
- Or me and this cake.
<br/>
Hey, guys. How you doing?
<br/>
Thank you so much.
<br/>
Aunt Viv, you outdid yourself.
<br/>
This is the most spectacular wedding
I've ever been to.
<br/>
Rachel, isn't it just perfection?
Sam, I love the bougainvillea arches.
<br/>
And the rosebush topiaries,
they're flawless.
<br/>
You are a landscaping genius.
<br/>
Thanks, Viv. You know, I really wanted
to do something special
<br/>
for your Chloe and my Papi
on their big day.
<br/>
- Only the best for my little girl.
- Cheers.
<br/>
Besides, I wanna spoil her rotten before
I have to leave her for so long.
<br/>
I can't believe you and Rachel
<br/>
are gonna be spending
six months in the rainforest.
<br/>
I mean, that's pretty intense.
<br/>
Are you kidding?
We are gonna have so much fun.
<br/>
We're gonna be looking for
rare plants that could cure diseases.
<br/>
And you know I love an adventure.
<br/>
Well, I promise to take good care
of the dogs while you guys are away.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Speaking of which,
today is about Chloe and Papi.
<br/>
So, come on. It's time to celebrate.
Let's dance!
<br/>
Let's dance.
<br/>
Oh, there goes my diet.
<br/>
I love this song.
<br/>
I never thought my dog
would get married before me.
<br/>
Well, maybe it'll be me and you walking
down that aisle one day.
<br/>
I'd like that very much, Rachel.
Some day.
<br/>
- Some day?
- Some day.
<br/>
I call this move the Chihuahua Waltz.
<br/>
You are so light on your paws,
mi corazón.
<br/>
You're not so bad yourself, my love.
<br/>
Tonight my heart is bursting.
I am the happiest dog alive!
<br/>
And I'm the luckiest girl ever.
<br/>
- Oh, look!
- What is it?
<br/>
A shooting star!
Quick, make a wish.
<br/>
What more could I ask for, micorazón?
What do you wish for?
<br/>
- Well, what about a family?
- Family?
<br/>
Chihuahua.
<br/>
Geronimo!
<br/>
Watch and see how it's done, everyone.
<br/>
I'm next, I'm next!
<br/>
- Me, me, me, me, me!
- Do it! Do it!
<br/>
Look out below! Yeah!
<br/>
- Oh, no. What are you kids doing?
- Look out, Lala. Here I come!
<br/>
Don't you dare, Papi, Jr.
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
- I must've slipped.
- You kids are a mess.
<br/>
I told you I wanted you clean
for the dog park.
<br/>
I don't know where your father is,
but when he hears about this,
<br/>
- he is gonna be so mad.
- Incoming!
<br/>
Let me show you how the big dogs do it!
<br/>
Oh, my love. I didn't see you there.
Come on in. It's really fun.
<br/>
Look at me. I'm covered in mud.
<br/>
Don't you usually pay for a mud mask?
This one's free!
<br/>
You kids get right into the bath.
<br/>
- But Mom, do we have to?
- I don't wanna take a bath.
<br/>
Bath now. Or no bacon-wrapped
filet mignon for dessert.
<br/>
- OK.
- OK.
<br/>
Papi, why do I always
have to be the bad guy?
<br/>
Because you're so good at it?
<br/>
I had a litter of five puppies, not six.
<br/>
You need to start being their father,
not their playmate.
<br/>
I better go get washed up.
<br/>
If I didn't know any better,
I would think I was in the doghouse.
<br/>
All right, everyone.
Who's up for the dog park?
<br/>
- We are!
- Hey, Sam.
<br/>
We're all waiting on you.
Let's go, fool!
<br/>
Come on, puppies!
<br/>
Rosa, Lala,
<br/>
Pep, Ali, you're
all as beautiful as your mother.
<br/>
- Thanks, Daddy.
- Where's Papi, Jr.?
<br/>
- Papi, Jr.?
- I'm not coming out.
<br/>
- Come on, buddy. Let's see your outfit.
- This is so embarrassing.
<br/>
I'm sure you look great. Let's see.
<br/>
I look ridiculous.
<br/>
You're right.
You do look ridiculous.
<br/>
No son of mine is gonna wear
clothes like that.
<br/>
Oh, Papi. But he looks so handsome.
<br/>
- There. It's dead now. Let's go.
- Thanks, Dad.
<br/>
Come on, puppies. Off to the dog park.
<br/>
We're here!
<br/>
Here we are. You guys
are gonna love this place.
<br/>
But be on your best behaviour.
<br/>
That's right.
This place is very exclusive.
<br/>
Your bone, sir.
<br/>
A vintage '03. A most excellent year.
<br/>
Ready to launch.
<br/>
And... paw!
<br/>
Fetch, boy. Fetch.
<br/>
So I said, "Honey, I only chase
imported cars." Zing!
<br/>
Lunch is served.
<br/>
- Hi, everyone!
- Chloe!
<br/>
You have to join us.
This sushi is faboo!
<br/>
Looks delish!
<br/>
Not as delish as that
retriever over there. Growl.
<br/>
Where're the kids? I thought
you brought the little ones.
<br/>
- Oh, Papi's watching them.
- But who's watching Papi?
<br/>
Go, Dad!
<br/>
OK, kids. Today we practise
the time-honoured tradition of digging.
<br/>
It is a skill that every dog must know.
We dig in order to stay grounded.
<br/>
I love dirt!
<br/>
OK. Ready? Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
<br/>
- Left, right. Left, right.
- Look at me! This is fun.
<br/>
- Left, right.
- I'm pretty good.
<br/>
I love digging!
<br/>
Dig, my puppies.
Dig with passion. Dig with love.
<br/>
Dig as if you were burying your
favourite bone.
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
Oh, you idiots. You got me dirty!
<br/>
- Sorry.
- I'm sorry.
<br/>
Pardon me, señorita. My kids got a
little carried away with their digging.
<br/>
- And who said you could speak to me?
- It's her again.
<br/>
I'll be right back.
<br/>
Well, you look like a stray.
How did you even get in here?
<br/>
Papi, what's going on?
<br/>
As if there weren't
enough of you peasants.
<br/>
Enough with that fake accent.
<br/>
Everyone knows you're from the Valley.
<br/>
Your little fluff balls ruined my perm.
<br/>
If there's a problem here, you say it
to me, but leave my kids out of it.
<br/>
Easy, mama bear.
<br/>
She's just all mad 'cause
she looks like a big, angry Q-tip.
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no!
<br/>
Leave my dog alone.
<br/>
Scoundrels!
<br/>
Excuse me, I think we all
just got off on the wrong paw.
<br/>
Is there a problem here?
<br/>
You know, this park is
for Beverly Hills residents only.
<br/>
Don't you have dog parks
where you live?
<br/>
- Hey, we have a right to be here.
- Really?
<br/>
Well then keep your little animals
<br/>
away from Mademoiselle
Marie Appoline Bouvier.
<br/>
She is a prize-winning show dog.
Aren't you, baby?
<br/>
And a three-time champion
of the Beverly Hills Dog Show.
<br/>
She can't handle stress.
<br/>
Then how does she handle you?
<br/>
Somebody get some ice for that burn.
<br/>
Come, Appoline. We're done here.
<br/>
Friendly.
<br/>
Hey, Mademoiselle, don't look now,
but somebody shaved your heinie!
<br/>
Papi, you're terrible.
<br/>
Well, my little bandidos,
you've had a very full day.
<br/>
Can't we stay up ten more minutes, Papa?
<br/>
- Please?
- Tell us a story!
<br/>
- Come on.
- OK. Settle down now.
<br/>
I promised your mother
I would put you to bed.
<br/>
She is the love of my life, and I would
do anything to make her happy.
<br/>
- Gross. No more love talk.
- Your mother is everything to me.
<br/>
I remember the first time
we rubbed noses.
<br/>
- Yuck.
- Grody.
<br/>
Dad, who wants to hear about love?
<br/>
What? Love is the most important
thing in the world.
<br/>
Let me tell you a story
about your great ancestors.
<br/>
Now listen to this.
<br/>
Long ago in ancient times...
<br/>
...inside the huge temples
there were hidden tunnels
<br/>
built just for Chihuahuas
to carry messages for their humans.
<br/>
The Chihuahuas were trusted to carry the
most precious secrets to their kingdoms.
<br/>
Sometimes, they were messages of love.
<br/>
The Chihuahuas faced great danger
to deliver these messages
<br/>
and did so proudly.
<br/>
They knew true love is worth any risk.
<br/>
Now, my little Chihuahua Warriors,
<br/>
love fearlessly, and help others
share their hearts as well.
<br/>
- Good night.
- Good night, Daddy.
<br/>
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.
<br/>
Good night, Papa.
<br/>
Miamor, you can soak
as long as you want.
<br/>
The children are asleep, like angels.
<br/>
That sounds wonderful.
<br/>
Oh, yes. Just go ahead and relax
all night. Papi has done the deed.
<br/>
You want me to look
at them sleeping, don't you?
<br/>
Yes. Very much.
<br/>
What is going on in here?
<br/>
We're digging tunnels to carry
our messages of love.
<br/>
- Yep. We sure are.
- It's so romantic.
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
I wonder where the kids could get
an idea like that, Papi?
<br/>
- I have no idea. Right, kids?
- Look at me!
<br/>
We got them from your story, silly.
<br/>
- Yeah. Dad told us all about it.
- Thanks, rats. I mean "kids."
<br/>
Papi, I sent you up here to put them
to bed, not to rile them up.
<br/>
But I didn't wanna ruin their fun.
<br/>
Besides, they're just puppies.
They don't know any better.
<br/>
So, it's up to us to teach them.
You can't be afraid to discipline them.
<br/>
Afraid? I'm not afraid.
I just don't like that part.
<br/>
OK, I want everyone in bed
this minute.
<br/>
- OK.
- OK.
<br/>
I'm digging fast. Try and beat me.
<br/>
Don't make me put you back
in that sailor outfit, Papi, Jr.
<br/>
Oh, look at the time. Good night.
<br/>
Come on. Everyone off to bed. Let's go.
<br/>
- Sorry, Mama.
- Sorry, Mama.
<br/>
Sorry, Mama.
<br/>
This dad business is harder
than I thought.
<br/>
I should've read the manual.
<br/>
What is...
<br/>
Hey, I...
<br/>
OK, OK. I'm up.
<br/>
I'm up.
<br/>
I know you guys are excited about
meeting my side of the family today,
<br/>
but at least let me get dressed first.
<br/>
So, what do you guys think of
where your dad and I grew up?
<br/>
- So many great memories.
- Papi. It's so colourful.
<br/>
- Wow, Dad.
- This is so cool.
<br/>
Oh, look, kids. Over there.
That's Dad's first fire hydrant.
<br/>
I got a bone hidden right there.
<br/>
Hey, Junior!
What's going on? It's Papi!
<br/>
Hi!
<br/>
Ice cream! Can we get
some ice cream, Dad?
<br/>
- Yeah, ice cream!
- Now, kids...
<br/>
All in good time, kids.
First, you must meet my family.
<br/>
- Hey, guys. We're here.
- Home sweet home.
<br/>
Come on, kids!
<br/>
- We're here!
- Hey, Ma!
<br/>
- Papi's home.
- Hey, Dad!
<br/>
Come meet your grandpuppies!
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
Here you guys go.
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
Pedro! Come here, boy!
<br/>
Come, come, come!
<br/>
Meet your nieces and nephew.
<br/>
- Hi, there.
- Hello.
<br/>
Hi, there.
<br/>
It's a Chupacabra!
<br/>
- It's gonna eat us!
- Help us!
<br/>
- Run for your lives!
- It's Dogzilla!
<br/>
- Run!
- Help!
<br/>
- Bro, you gotta work on that smile.
- That was a smile?
<br/>
Chloe, kids, I'd like you to meet,
mi hermano, Pedro.
<br/>
- Give me some paw.
- Up high.
<br/>
What?
<br/>
Hi, everyone.
<br/>
Oh, Pedro. It's so good
to finally meet you.
<br/>
Chloe, you are even lovelier
than I imagined.
<br/>
I'm sorry I was not here to greet you.
I saw a butterfly in the yard
<br/>
whose wing was caught
in a blade of grass,
<br/>
and I had to blow on it to set it free.
<br/>
How can you and Dad be brothers?
You don't look anything alike.
<br/>
They're not real brothers, silly.
They grew up on the streets together.
<br/>
That doesn't make our brotherhood
any less real, kids.
<br/>
Family is about who you love,
Not just who you're born to.
<br/>
Well said, mi hermano.
<br/>
Dad, what are these?
<br/>
What are all these bills?
<br/>
We should tell him, Fernando.
<br/>
Tell me what?
<br/>
You kids go in the backyard and play.
It's time for the adults to talk.
<br/>
Ma!
<br/>
- Do we have to?
- Now. Off you go.
<br/>
- Oh, man.
- No fair.
<br/>
- Yeah, what's the big secret, anyway?
- Yeah?
<br/>
Why don't the adults go outside?
<br/>
- Not us.
- Wait for me!
<br/>
I haven't been able
to make the mortgage payments, mi hijo.
<br/>
I mean, an eviction letter?
Dad, why didn't you tell me?
<br/>
I thought I could catch up
with the payments.
<br/>
The man came from the bank.
<br/>
What are they saying, Papi, Jr.?
<br/>
I can't see. Wait. I got an idea.
<br/>
What about all the money
from the landscaping jobs?
<br/>
Ever since I threw my back out,
I haven't been able to work.
<br/>
We've lost a lot of jobs
with the company down to just you, hijo.
<br/>
There's gotta be somebody we can
ask to borrow the money from.
<br/>
Hold still!
<br/>
Your paws smell.
<br/>
Can you hurry, Papi, Jr.?
I have to tinkle.
<br/>
- Don't even think about it, Ali.
- Guys... I'm trying to listen.
<br/>
- What about Viv?
- No.
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no.
<br/>
We will not burden anyone
with our problems.
<br/>
This is a family affair.
<br/>
I can't hold you guys much longer.
<br/>
Oh, no!
<br/>
We're going down!
<br/>
What did you find out, Papi, Jr.?
<br/>
Not much. But, I did find out
where Pedro likes to poop.
<br/>
The Cortezes have always pulled
themselves up.
<br/>
- What if we can't?
- We will lose the house.
<br/>
What?
<br/>
Well, your mother and I will have
to go live with my sister and her family
<br/>
- in Arizona.
- It's so far.
<br/>
I'll never see you guys.
<br/>
And they live in that tiny little
apartment. I mean, what about Pedro?
<br/>
Oh, my heart is breaking.
<br/>
It's only until
we can save some money.
<br/>
We'll go to the bank first thing
in the morning. It's gonna be OK.
<br/>
- Good.
- They can't lose this place.
<br/>
This was my first home.
<br/>
Before this house,
we were on the streets.
<br/>
Find anything in there, Papi?
<br/>
Just this stylish hat.
Hey, Pedro, I'm hungry.
<br/>
- Hey, you mutts, get out of here!
- It's him again! Run!
<br/>
Yep. Life on the streets was no picnic.
<br/>
But then one day, all that changed...
<br/>
...when Sam and his parents adopted us.
<br/>
Suddenly, we had a family.
<br/>
Papi, I know how much
this home means to you.
<br/>
- To all of us.
- They gave us a home.
<br/>
Now we gotta do everything we can
to help them keep it.
<br/>
Oh, yes, Cortez.
<br/>
Gentlemen, I'd really like
to help you out, but my hands are tied.
<br/>
You're just too far behind
on your payments.
<br/>
What are we gonna do? I don't...
<br/>
Try begging, Sam.
It works when I want your burrito.
<br/>
Didn't realise you brought your dog.
<br/>
Fun. I'm really more of
a cat person myself.
<br/>
- Little Prince Albert.
- Now I know what's wrong with you.
<br/>
Isn't he a cutie?
<br/>
Look, sir, this is our home.
Our life is there.
<br/>
- Our memories.
- Our squeaky toys.
<br/>
Well, memories don't pay the bills.
Now, you've received your final notice
<br/>
and once that happens the bank can only
give you till the end of the month.
<br/>
Now, that's... for you, let's see,
that means you have three weeks
<br/>
to come up with...
<br/>
...wow, $40,000.
<br/>
Now, if you don't get us the money
by then, the house is ours.
<br/>
Forty thousand dollars?!
Do you accept Mexican Express?
<br/>
There's no way we can come up
with all that money in three weeks.
<br/>
Look, gentlemen, I am really sorry
I couldn't help you out.
<br/>
You know what? Please, take one
of these free pens for your troubles.
<br/>
Here you go.
<br/>
Not that one. They have to qualify
you for a loan for that.
<br/>
Just one each.
<br/>
Just one. Fine. OK.
<br/>
A pen. They take your house
and they give you a pen.
<br/>
OK, mis niños, everyone to bed.
<br/>
Are you scared about
losing this house, Daddy?
<br/>
Well, yes. I am.
<br/>
But, you're not supposed to get scared.
<br/>
- Yeah. You're the dad.
- Right. Well...
<br/>
- You know who was always brave?
- Chihuahua Warriors!
<br/>
Yes! Now let me tell you a
story that will make you feel better.
<br/>
Yeah!
<br/>
Long ago, tribes would
all work together as one family
<br/>
and the young would be nurtured
and cared for by the entire tribe.
<br/>
But the whole village
would be watched over
<br/>
by the brave and mighty Chihuahua...
<br/>
...which is lucky, because on this day
<br/>
a vicious snake
was looking for an easy victim.
<br/>
And the mighty Chihuahua
swung into action,
<br/>
grabbing the snake with its jaws
and wrestling it to the ground.
<br/>
And even the mightiest human warriors
<br/>
were impressed with
this brave little dog.
<br/>
He was the hero to the whole village,
<br/>
but most of all,
he was a hero to his own family.
<br/>
I'm afraid of snakes.
<br/>
- Me, too.
- Not the Chihuahua Warriors.
<br/>
They weren't afraid of anything.
Right, Dad?
<br/>
Of course they were afraid.
Everyone has fears.
<br/>
The difference is, a Chihuahua Warrior
has the courage to face their fears.
<br/>
- Even of snakes?
- Yes. Even of snakes.
<br/>
Buenas noches, my brave little
Chihuahua Warriors! Sweet dreams.
<br/>
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Dad.
<br/>
Hey! You guys see that? That
vine looks like a snake.
<br/>
That's a branch, silly.
<br/>
No, look! It's a ferocious beast.
<br/>
- Yeah, let's get it.
- Yeah.
<br/>
So? Are they asleep this time?
<br/>
Go ahead, check. I assure you,
they are peacefully asleep.
<br/>
On second thought, I'll be right back!
<br/>
Get it, Papi, Jr.!
<br/>
- Get over here now, you evil beast.
- Get the snake!
<br/>
I got you right where I want you.
<br/>
- Yeah! You can do it!
- Kids! Kids!
<br/>
You need to tone it down
before your mom...
<br/>
Let me guess,
you told them another story.
<br/>
Papi, Jr. is a brave
Chihuahua Warrior. See?
<br/>
What on earth are you doing?
<br/>
- Get down from there!
- No!
<br/>
Delgado!
<br/>
I've never been so happy
to see someone in my whole life!
<br/>
Hello, princesa. I believe
this little one belongs to you.
<br/>
Thank goodness you were here.
I'm forever in your debt, Delgado.
<br/>
Papi, Jr., you go back to bed this
instant and never do that again.
<br/>
I was just trying to be a brave
Chihuahua Warrior,
<br/>
like in Dad's stories.
<br/>
Papi!
<br/>
Well, I guess he didn't read
the fine print where I said,
<br/>
- "Don't try this at home."
- Thanks, Delgado.
<br/>
And nice catch.
<br/>
- What's going on out here?
- Sam?
<br/>
- Delgado?
- Papi, I see you still have your human.
<br/>
- I don't believe it.
- Don't get all mushy on me now.
<br/>
How did you get here
all the way from Mexico?
<br/>
I better call your partner, Detective
Ramirez, and find out what's up.
<br/>
- Delgado, how did you find us?
- The scent.
<br/>
Chloe's the only dog I know
who wears Chanel No. 5.
<br/>
Pedro, this is the amigo
I told you about,
<br/>
the one that kept micorazón
safe when she was lost in Mexico.
<br/>
It's a true honour to meet you.
<br/>
Maybe don't flash that grill, bro.
<br/>
What are you doing
in Los Angeles, Delgado?
<br/>
I'm here on assignment. Police business.
<br/>
I know. It's a jewel heist, isn't it?
<br/>
Or counterfeiters.
Or kidnappers...
<br/>
I can see you
haven't changed a bit, kid.
<br/>
I bet you're tracking
a cat burglar, right?
<br/>
I can't tell you,
but I can use your help.
<br/>
Will you come with me
on a special assignment tomorrow?
<br/>
Delgado, I would do anything for you.
<br/>
All right, Detective Ramirez, will do.
<br/>
So you met this dog in Mexico, and now
he found you here in Los Angeles?
<br/>
Yeah, I don't know why he came here.
<br/>
But Detective Ramirez said
they're wrapping up a big case
<br/>
and that, they won't be able
to pick him up for a few weeks.
<br/>
I said we'd look after him
until they come.
<br/>
- Come on, guys. Let's get back to bed.
- We're so glad you're here, my friend.
<br/>
Glad to be here, amigo.
<br/>
Come on, Delgado. I'll show you
where you can stay.
<br/>
You OK, bro?
<br/>
No, I think I messed up tonight, Pedro.
Papi, Jr. could have gotten very hurt.
<br/>
I just hope I can be the father that
Chloe wants me to be.
<br/>
Any mutt can have puppies,
but it takes a real dog to be a father.
<br/>
Just follow your heart.
<br/>
My heart is what keeps
getting me in trouble.
<br/>
What are we doing
at the police station?
<br/>
What's so secret?
Am I some sort of lookout?
<br/>
- No. No.
- Do we need disguises?
<br/>
- Are we here to meet our contacts?
- No!
<br/>
Maybe...
Maybe we should have code names.
<br/>
Mine's gonna be "White Fox." Yeah!
<br/>
And yours should be...
I know, "Jellybean"!
<br/>
No. Chloe, I just need you
to be here, OK? Because...
<br/>
This is a bad idea.
Maybe we should go.
<br/>
Look. Those two dogs
are coming this way.
<br/>
- What are you doing here?
- We're here on the big case with you.
<br/>
Delgado, I mean,
<br/>
- "Jellybean" and I are old partners.
- Chloe!
<br/>
I came all the way from Mexico.
I have something to tell you.
<br/>
- It's important.
- Look, we're kind of busy right now.
<br/>
- We're working on a bank robbery case.
- Bank robbery!
<br/>
You can totally count on White Fox
and Jellybean to have your back.
<br/>
Not if one of them happens to be your
father. He's never had our back.
<br/>
Let's go.
<br/>
- We have to go now.
- Bye.
<br/>
- "Father"? Is that a code word?
- No. Those are my sons.
<br/>
"Sons"? I had no idea you had sons.
<br/>
I thought with you by my side, I'd have
the strength to tell them the truth.
<br/>
Forget it. I can't change the past now.
<br/>
I'm sorry I dragged you
into this, Chloe.
<br/>
Oh, Sam, there must be something
we can do. I'm gonna ask Aunt Viv.
<br/>
No, no, no.
<br/>
My father's very proud.
<br/>
Borrowing money is something
he just can't do.
<br/>
- I'm gonna come home.
- No, it's OK.
<br/>
I think I found it. I think this is it!
<br/>
Rachel, you and Aunt Viv are doing
important research down there.
<br/>
We'll figure something out.
<br/>
I love you, Sam.
I'm here for you if you need me.
<br/>
You know, I should go.
<br/>
I'm not making very good company right
now. So... talk to you soon.
<br/>
OK. Bye.
<br/>
Was that Rachel on the phone?
<br/>
Yep.
<br/>
So, when am I gonna
start planning the wedding?
<br/>
I've already picked out my dress.
<br/>
Ma, come on.
<br/>
I love Rachel.
You know, I think she's great.
<br/>
- So?
- I'm just... you know, I'm worried.
<br/>
What are you worried about?
<br/>
I'm worried I won't be able
to give her the life she deserves.
<br/>
You just don't get it, do you?
<br/>
You both love each other,
and that's what's important.
<br/>
The rest will work itself out.
<br/>
Man, Papi. What am I gonna do?
<br/>
I'm scared I won't be...
<br/>
- ...won't be enough.
- Won't be enough.
<br/>
I feel you, man. I feel you.
<br/>
- Were you expecting anyone?
- No.
<br/>
- I hope it's pizza.
- For breakfast?
<br/>
What? Any time is pizza time!
<br/>
Hello? Hello?
<br/>
Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry.
Did we wake you up?
<br/>
You know what? Good for you.
<br/>
To be in this much debt and still be
able to sleep like a baby?
<br/>
That's a gift. I'm Mr Kroop.
We met the other day at the bank.
<br/>
How could I forget? You gave me a pen.
<br/>
Yes, I did. And now,
I'm giving you a notice.
<br/>
I'm here to inspect the house
since the bank will be...
<br/>
...selling it once you're out.
<br/>
Let's move, people. Could we get
some coffee? That'd be great.
<br/>
More dogs. Lovely. Morning!
<br/>
- Samuel, what's going on?
- They can't just come in like this.
<br/>
There's nothing we can do.
They have the right.
<br/>
Come on, everyone. They're not
taking this house so easily.
<br/>
- Yeah!
- Let's go.
<br/>
Hi, there! Can we all just get along?
<br/>
Adiós.
<br/>
Good thing that table was there
to break his fall.
<br/>
No, no, no, no.
Come on. That's not yours.
<br/>
Give it to me. Put it down.
Come on.
<br/>
- Let go.
- You let go.
<br/>
Bad lady. Very bad lady!
<br/>
- Give it to me!
- Be careful what you wish for.
<br/>
Good one.
<br/>
OK. Now, I need you
to sign some documents.
<br/>
I need you to sign here, here and...
<br/>
I probably wouldn't use...
These almost never work.
<br/>
So why don't we use mine.
<br/>
I'm not really a dog person. I just...
<br/>
I... Could you just...
<br/>
Could you just step off the papers?
They're kind of important.
<br/>
Put the pen down.
<br/>
- You wouldn't dare.
- Just try me, cat man.
<br/>
- I feel better now.
- When you gotta go, you gotta go.
<br/>
- I'll take that. Thank you.
- Hey!
<br/>
Bad dog! Bad dog!
<br/>
Come back here!
Where you going? Drop it! Leave it!
<br/>
Bad dog!
<br/>
Looking for this?
<br/>
This is a madhouse!
<br/>
I am officially evicting you
from this property.
<br/>
- What? We have three weeks!
- You can't do this to us.
<br/>
Yes, I can.
Your dogs have ruined this house,
<br/>
and this house is about
to belong to the bank.
<br/>
You know I could have the sheriff here?
Would you like that?
<br/>
I want you out of here by tonight,
<br/>
before your little rats
can do any more damage.
<br/>
I'll take this back.
Thank you very much.
<br/>
What do we do now? Sleep in the streets?
<br/>
Don't worry. You guys
are gonna be comfortable here.
<br/>
- How many people live here?
- One.
<br/>
Must be a giant.
<br/>
Aunt Viv said you could stay
as long as you need.
<br/>
I'm too depressed to eat.
<br/>
This is some place, Ma.
<br/>
Even the doghouse
is bigger than our place.
<br/>
Excuse me.
<br/>
I'm just trying to cheer her up.
<br/>
I know.
<br/>
I'll go talk to her.
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
"Beverly Hills Dog Show"?
<br/>
Fifty thousand dollar prize?
That's it! We should enter the dog show.
<br/>
- Papi, look!
- My love, you're a genius.
<br/>
If we win,
the money would save the house.
<br/>
You think you could win the dog show?
Impossible. It is always moi.
<br/>
Do not make me laugh. Chihuahua?
More like "chi-ha-ha."
<br/>
That's it. You're going down, Frenchy!
<br/>
We're gonna do this. Let's tell Sam.
<br/>
What's gotten into you two?
<br/>
Hello! I wanna do the dog show.
<br/>
Look at you posing.
<br/>
Dog show.
<br/>
Wait a second. Oh, my gosh.
<br/>
You guys could be in the dog show.
That $50,000 prize could save the house.
<br/>
- Good idea, Chloe.
- Finally. Guys are so slow.
<br/>
- Is he nervous about the dog show?
- No, it's not that.
<br/>
Looks like he could use a friend.
<br/>
- You OK, amigo?
- Yeah. Sure.
<br/>
I know you're worried about your sons.
Please tell us what happened, Delgado.
<br/>
We're your friends. You can trust us.
<br/>
About three years ago,
when I was on the force in Mexico,
<br/>
we apprehended some really bad guys.
<br/>
We also got their dogs.
<br/>
Those dogs said they'd get their
revenge by hurting my pups.
<br/>
So I took my boys out of the country
and brought 'em to Los Angeles.
<br/>
Thought they'd be safer away from me.
<br/>
It was the hardest thing I've ever done.
<br/>
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
<br/>
I went into hiding
and I lost contact with my sons.
<br/>
And as time went by,
I knew I had to find them again.
<br/>
But now they think
I abandoned them for no reason.
<br/>
But if you tell them what happened,
they'll understand.
<br/>
My sons won't listen to me. After
the dog show, I'm going back to Mexico.
<br/>
Poor Delgado.
We gotta do something to help him.
<br/>
- Dad?
- Oh, sorry to wake you, son.
<br/>
- Go back to sleep.
- We can't sleep.
<br/>
Yeah. We're too worried
about our family splitting up.
<br/>
- I know, niños.
- Tell us another story, Daddy.
<br/>
Yeah. Another one
about the Chihuahua Warriors.
<br/>
No, I really shouldn't.
Remember what happened last time?
<br/>
- Daddy.
- Come on, Daddy.
<br/>
- Yeah, Dad. Please?
- OK. All right.
<br/>
You see, the Chihuahua Warriors,
<br/>
they were not just brave
and passionate.
<br/>
They were also fiercely loyal to their
fellow Chihuahuas and to their humans.
<br/>
- They were?
- Oh, yes. In ancient times,
<br/>
they used to follow
their humans into battle.
<br/>
Fighting for their kingdom
was often very fierce.
<br/>
But they knew that
even in times of great danger,
<br/>
they must stand by their friends and
warn them of their attacking enemies.
<br/>
Even at the risk of their own lives.
<br/>
That Chihuahua saved the king's life?
<br/>
Yes. Stick by your loved ones,
even in hard times.
<br/>
We are stronger together
than we are alone.
<br/>
From now on, we'll be the most
loyal Chihuahuas ever,
<br/>
and we'll never let our family split up.
<br/>
- I know you won't. Sleep tight.
- Good night, Dad.
<br/>
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night, Papa.
<br/>
...was the best in breed.
<br/>
Think like a winner, be a winner!
Think like a winner, be a winner!
<br/>
- Top of the morning to you.
- Likewise.
<br/>
- Yes, thank you.
- Oh, yes. Sure. Very nice.
<br/>
That is one big cheque. Sam,
you're gonna need a bigger wallet.
<br/>
Pretty. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.
<br/>
How ya doing, buddy?
<br/>
Is it me, or is it hard to tell
the dogs from their owners?
<br/>
Hey, man, don't flatter yourself.
<br/>
May I help you?
<br/>
I hope so.
We're here to enter the dog show.
<br/>
- Buenos dias.
- With these dogs?
<br/>
This is a very prestigious dog show.
Dogs train for years to be prepared.
<br/>
I am not sure you or
your dogs have what it takes.
<br/>
Well, I think we
just might surprise you.
<br/>
I doubt it.
<br/>
But in the meantime,
you could fill out these forms.
<br/>
- Oh, hello!
- Hi.
<br/>
Good to see you.
<br/>
- Let me get your paperwork.
- Yes, thank you.
<br/>
Beautiful, darling, beautiful.
Look this way.
<br/>
Little higher. There you go.
Thank you. Appoline, right here.
<br/>
Do I smell garbage? Oh, oh, no.
It is just the peasant dogs.
<br/>
We're the ones that smell?
<br/>
Well, there's a reason "poodle"
starts with the word "poo"!
<br/>
Good one.
<br/>
And now, live from
Beverly Hills, California...
<br/>
It's starting!
<br/>
They just have to win!
I've got all my paws crossed.
<br/>
This is more nerve racking
than a trip to the vet!
<br/>
Will you Chatty Cathys shush!
<br/>
The 25th Annual Beverly Hills
Dog Show is now underway.
<br/>
And, Polly, we have got dogs
from all over the world
<br/>
competing in three different categories:
Beauty, style, talent.
<br/>
Gonna see who the top dog is, winning
that $50,000 grand prize.
<br/>
- I got goose bumps.
- Look!
<br/>
Here comes our panel of judges,
led by the esteemed Judge McKible.
<br/>
All right, people,
two minutes to show time.
<br/>
- You guys ready to do this?
- I'm in.
<br/>
And we are off with the first round:
Beauty.
<br/>
Yeah, let's see those
Beverly Hills dogs strut their stuff.
<br/>
Fantastic!
<br/>
- Now that's cute.
- Yeah, look at that.
<br/>
I wouldn't put money on that one.
<br/>
- Oh, my.
- Oh, no! Delgado's been eliminated.
<br/>
Uncle Delgado looks so sad.
<br/>
And he's gonna lose his sons, too.
<br/>
It is time for the second round: Style.
<br/>
And only ten contestants
remain in the competition.
<br/>
Fashion.
<br/>
I'm gonna get stung.
<br/>
I'm just so happy to be here.
I just can't help but...
<br/>
Wait! Don't do a Pedro! Don't...
<br/>
...smile.
<br/>
Disqualified!
<br/>
Look at that.
<br/>
Looks like a cupcake exploded.
<br/>
Bravissimo!
<br/>
There's my ride.
<br/>
Ay, Chihuahua!
<br/>
Now, I like this one.
This one I really do like.
<br/>
- It's like a little angel. Right?
- Yes, exactly.
<br/>
Chihuahua Aztec Warrior!
Fantastic!
<br/>
- There's Dad! There's Dad!
- Oh, he's bursting with pizzazz!
<br/>
Go, Dad!
<br/>
He really is a Chihuahua Warrior!
<br/>
Well, we are on to Round Three: Talent!
<br/>
And with only five dogs left,
this competition is really heating up!
<br/>
Faboo!
<br/>
That one was faboo, too.
<br/>
Faboo. I'm gonna start saying that.
<br/>
Faboo!
<br/>
No, no.
<br/>
Snooty. Snooty puss. Got a snooty puss.
<br/>
- She's good.
- That is amazing.
<br/>
Look at that. Oh, marvellous
<br/>
- Clever! Clever!
- My gosh. That's so impressive.
<br/>
- That's clever.
- It's an homage. It is an homage!
<br/>
That Appoline is a regular Pet-casso.
<br/>
- You get that?
- I got it.
<br/>
- Yes, yes. Very clever.
- Pet-casso.
<br/>
No! No, no, no! Dismissed!
<br/>
What? Oh, you have gotta be kidding!
<br/>
- Not fair.
- It's a dog! Playing a piano.
<br/>
If you can't play it right,
you shouldn't play it at all.
<br/>
Playing the piano with paws.
Not even fingers.
<br/>
- Boo! Not faboo.
- Sorry.
<br/>
What is going on?
<br/>
How dare you!
My Chloe is the most beautiful,
<br/>
the most stylish and the most
talented dog in the entire world!
<br/>
She has a coat
like the whitest of snow,
<br/>
and eyes that sparkle like diamonds,
and a heart as big as...
<br/>
Well, as big as...
Why don't I just show you?
<br/>
Papi, what are you doing?
<br/>
She has a heart as big as this one.
<br/>
My Chloe will live in my heart forever.
<br/>
Now that's talent.
<br/>
Papi! Papi! Papi!
Papi! Papi! Papi!
<br/>
Papi! Papi! Papi!
<br/>
I'll tell you, Appoline has
some serious competition this year,
<br/>
- and his name is Papi!
- Papi. I love you, Papi!
<br/>
Oh, Papi, te adoro.
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have chosen this year's finalists,
<br/>
and they are... Papi Cortez...
<br/>
Yes!
<br/>
- ...and Appoline Bouvier.
- Yes!
<br/>
Judge McKible.
<br/>
What's this?
<br/>
I don't know, but Judge McKible
looks very concerned.
<br/>
Mr Cortez, you do realise
<br/>
the Beverly Hills Dog Show
is for purebreds only.
<br/>
Do you have Papi's birth papers
showing his pedigree?
<br/>
No, we rescued him from the street.
He was a stray.
<br/>
I knew it.
<br/>
He might not have
breeding papers or a pedigree,
<br/>
but you'll never meet a dog that shows
more pure Chihuahua heart...
<br/>
...than Papi.
<br/>
Fight the tears. I'm not gonna cry.
I'm not gonna do it. Not gonna cry.
<br/>
- Bravo.
- So important.
<br/>
Hear, hear.
<br/>
- Well said.
- I'm sorry, rules are rules.
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,
<br/>
Papi Cortez has been disqualified
for lack of breeding papers.
<br/>
- I'm so upset.
- Oh, no.
<br/>
The winner of the 25th annual
Beverly Hills Dog Show
<br/>
- for the fourth year in a row is...
- Mademoiselle Marie Appoline Bouvier!
<br/>
These dogs aren't the only thing fixed
about this competition.
<br/>
We won!
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
We won.
<br/>
Let's go, guys.
<br/>
That's it for
the Beverly Hills Dog Show.
<br/>
This is loco. I can't even watch.
<br/>
- Oh, no.
- It's not fair.
<br/>
I know something we can do.
<br/>
- Hello?
- Rach?
<br/>
Sam, how'd it go?
<br/>
- Not so good.
- Oh, no.
<br/>
Yeah, now we have two days
to pack up the house and move on.
<br/>
- Oh, Sam.
- I'm going to Arizona
<br/>
for a little while to get them set up.
<br/>
I already contacted Viv's housekeeper
about watching the dogs.
<br/>
- I can come too, if you want.
- Nah, that's OK.
<br/>
- This is a family thing.
- I... thought we were family.
<br/>
You know, that we would get married
and have kids someday.
<br/>
Rach, I can't take care
of you and a family
<br/>
when I can hardly take care
of the one I already have.
<br/>
Oh, I see.
<br/>
I should go, they need me here.
<br/>
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Rach.
<br/>
Sam, love is like chasing your tail,
<br/>
spinning and spinning...
<br/>
And trust me,
it hurts when you catch it.
<br/>
Papi, come quick! The puppies are gone!
I can't find them anywhere!
<br/>
- What? Gone?
- Oh, no.
<br/>
- What are you talking about?
- Maybe they're hiding somewhere.
<br/>
- Kids! Niños! Hey, this isn't funny.
- Kids! Where are you?
<br/>
The scent's old.
They're not in the house.
<br/>
If anything happens to them,
I don't know what I'll do.
<br/>
Don't worry, miamor,
I will not let that happen.
<br/>
Where could they be?
<br/>
This is scary. We've never been
out by ourselves before.
<br/>
Don't you want to be
real Chihuahua Warriors,
<br/>
- like the ones in Dad's stories?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Then we have to help Uncle Delgado.
<br/>
'Cause families stick together
and Delgado is family.
<br/>
Now, this is where Delgado
said his sons work.
<br/>
We'll just tell them the truth
and they'll forgive him.
<br/>
Attention, all units.
Attention, all units.
<br/>
We have a robbery in progress
at Southcoast Bank. All units respond.
<br/>
We got a situation, everybody.
Round up the dogs and move out!
<br/>
- Quick time, double time, let's go!
- Come on.
<br/>
Hey, those dogs look
just like Uncle Delgado.
<br/>
That must be them. Let's go!
<br/>
Let's get 'em in.
<br/>
Close 'er up!
<br/>
- Go! Go! Go!
- K-9 unit, what's your status?
<br/>
Yes, this is the K-9 unit,
is mobile and on the move.
<br/>
Hey, what are you doing in here?
This is police property.
<br/>
We're friends with your dad, and we've
got something to tell you.
<br/>
Move it, move it! Move, move, move!
<br/>
- Copy that. Go, go!
- Keep going!
<br/>
- Second unit, in. Go!
- Come on. Go, go, go! Go, go, go!
<br/>
Let's go. Right there!
<br/>
Come on, boys!
Come on, boys! Catch the scent!
<br/>
We'll talk more about this after.
<br/>
Stay here,
we don't want you getting hurt.
<br/>
Come on, boys. Let's go.
<br/>
Oh, no. We didn't tell them Uncle
Delgado's leaving LA soon. Come on!
<br/>
Yes, five puppies. Yeah.
<br/>
Well, if you see them,
please give us a call.
<br/>
- Any news?
- I feel terrible.
<br/>
I put those stories in their heads.
<br/>
When will I ever learn?
<br/>
...where a bank robbery is in progress.
<br/>
Hey, isn't that our bank?
<br/>
- Turn it up.
- It is our bank.
<br/>
Police have informed us that
the robbers are still inside.
<br/>
At this time, there are no hostages.
<br/>
- Did I just see what I think I saw?
- Yes! It's them!
<br/>
We will keep you updated on this
breaking story as events unfold.
<br/>
- Guacamole's going on here?
- I'm going to the bank.
<br/>
Mom, Dad, you guys stay here in case
anyone calls and gets them first.
<br/>
- Of course.
- Please hurry, Sam.
<br/>
- They're my puppies. I'm going too.
- Not without me.
<br/>
Delgado, Pedro, let's roll.
<br/>
I don't see Delgado's sons.
Where'd they go?
<br/>
I bet they went that way.
Follow me.
<br/>
Oh, no. What if we never find them?
<br/>
I mean, of course we'll find them.
We're Warriors.
<br/>
Antonio! Alberto! Where are you?
<br/>
This is scary.
<br/>
Presents! Oh, boy, is it Christmas?
<br/>
Hey, look. This is what everyone's been
saying we need.
<br/>
We can save the house with this.
<br/>
Everyone, get as much of it as you can.
<br/>
- Yeah!
- Come on, guys.
<br/>
- I'm next. I'm next. Me me, me.
- Wow. Look at all this.
<br/>
Come on, the coast is clear.
<br/>
Come on, come on. Come on.
<br/>
Hey, what's going on here?
<br/>
- Who turned out the lights?
- Hurry up.
<br/>
- What's going on?
- Get us out of here.
<br/>
- What's the big idea?
- What's happening?
<br/>
- It's dark in here.
- Go!
<br/>
What?
<br/>
Gone? Are you sure?
<br/>
Please, stand back here.
<br/>
I'm sorry, folks. You're just gonna
have to stay back.
<br/>
- You guys, wait here.
- No way,
<br/>
those are my kids you're talking about.
Come on, let's go.
<br/>
Yeah, I can't say
anything right now, ma'am.
<br/>
- Sorry about that, but I can't.
- What exactly happened?
<br/>
There were at least 15 or 20 of them.
<br/>
They were ninja fast,
and they all were very, very large,
<br/>
but I fought four
or five of them off myself.
<br/>
This is a crime scene, sir.
I need you to step back.
<br/>
Right, sorry. Did you happen to see
five Chihuahua puppies around here?
<br/>
Puppies?
<br/>
I got their scent. Come on.
<br/>
They were just here.
Search for clues.
<br/>
Hey. Look at this.
<br/>
Look what I found.
<br/>
Great, a clue!
<br/>
A ski mask? You think it has
something to do with the kids?
<br/>
- Yeah?
- I know who can help us. Come on.
<br/>
You can do this, Delgado. Go talk to
them. I'll be right behind you.
<br/>
Dad? What are you doing here?
<br/>
Look, I know you don't
want to see me right now,
<br/>
but I got some missing puppies.
<br/>
And I think this may be a clue
as to where they went. Any ideas?
<br/>
Smells like flour. Eggs. Butter.
<br/>
- Bread. It's bread.
- Any bakeries around here?
<br/>
Oh, of course. The Hoffman
Bread factory! It's right near here.
<br/>
Good job, kid. Let's go get your pups.
<br/>
We'll grab the humans
and meet you there.
<br/>
Thanks, boys.
<br/>
Come on, everyone. Vámonos.
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
Oh, where are they going?
Where are they going?
<br/>
Police business, look out!
Coming through.
<br/>
Watch out, dog crossing!
<br/>
Hey, better hurry up
before the foreman shows up.
<br/>
Yeah, like he'd ever notice.
<br/>
How many of these jobs we pulled off
in the last few months?
<br/>
Yeah, we just hit the on button
and the machines do all the work.
<br/>
It's a perfect cover.
<br/>
This smells like the place.
<br/>
- Pumpernickel.
- Let's go.
<br/>
Those guys in there can be real meanies.
You got some kind of a plan?
<br/>
Don't I always, hermano?
<br/>
- Help!
- Somebody help us!
<br/>
Let us out!
<br/>
Let's see how much we got.
<br/>
- Who brought the dog?
- I didn't bring the dog.
<br/>
Back off, mister. You can't kidnap us
and get away with it.
<br/>
- Sounds like a rubber duck.
- That guy is tough.
<br/>
- Bring it on. I'm a Chihuahua Warrior.
- What are you gonna do, bite my toe?
<br/>
Look how tough he thinks he is.
<br/>
I'm really good.
<br/>
- Nice doggy.
- Back away from the puppies!
<br/>
And in case you're wondering,
this isn't a smile.
<br/>
Easy. Nice doggy.
<br/>
- Who you callin' "nice"?
- I'm outta here.
<br/>
Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
Split up! Split up!
<br/>
Uncle Pedro. You found us!
<br/>
I mean, not that I needed your help
or anything. But they're getting away!
<br/>
Don't worry. They won't get far.
<br/>
- There's the signal.
- Ready?
<br/>
Ready.
<br/>
Help! I wanna go home!
<br/>
Gee, that was kinda fun.
<br/>
Thank goodness you're OK.
<br/>
- Mom?
- Delgado!
<br/>
Looks like we still make
a pretty good team, Jellybean.
<br/>
- I mean, Delgado.
- Yeah, we still got it, kid.
<br/>
But let's not make a habit
of this rescuing thing.
<br/>
We lost 'em.
<br/>
Incoming!
<br/>
Left, right. Left, right. Left, right.
No one messes with my kids.
<br/>
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right. Left, right.
<br/>
Left, right. Left, right.
Left, right.
<br/>
- What's going on?
- Left, right. Left, right. Left, right!
<br/>
You think that's gonna stop us?
<br/>
No, but this will.
<br/>
Now you guys are really
rollin' in the dough.
<br/>
- Daddy, that was awesome!
- Wow, Dad, that was amazing!
<br/>
- That was awesome.
- We showed them.
<br/>
Your mother and I were worried sick.
<br/>
What you kids did, leavin' home
without tellin' us, was off-leash.
<br/>
Way off leash!
<br/>
- Sorry, Dad.
- We're sorry, Dad.
<br/>
- Sorry, Dad.
- Sorry isn't good enough.
<br/>
You kids are grounded
for the... rest of your lives!
<br/>
- What?
- No way!
<br/>
Papi, their intentions were in the
right place and, if it wasn't for them,
<br/>
- the bank robbers would've gotten away.
- True.
<br/>
So, what, two weeks?
<br/>
Don't you think they've shown
that they are good Chihuahua Warriors?
<br/>
OK, you're grounded for one week.
<br/>
And no bacon-wrapped filet mignon.
<br/>
- No.
- Come on, Dad.
<br/>
OK, OK, you can have 'em.
But act like you don't like 'em.
<br/>
- OK, Dad.
- Promise.
<br/>
Papi, I'm so proud of you.
<br/>
You're really becoming the father
I always knew you could be.
<br/>
Thank you, micorazón.
<br/>
- OK, our bus is ready.
- You got the wrong guy.
<br/>
- Yeah, yeah. We're bread makers.
- Yeah, yeah, I'm sure.
<br/>
- I hope you got a good lawyer.
- I hate dogs.
<br/>
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
<br/>
Come on, Delgado. Turn around.
<br/>
Dad, wait.
<br/>
I think we owe you an apology.
<br/>
Chloe and the puppies
told us why you left.
<br/>
We didn't know that you did it
to protect us. Thank you, Dad.
<br/>
I'm just glad I got a chance to see you
boys again. Make things right.
<br/>
Come on, guys.
<br/>
Quite the police dog, fella.
<br/>
Let's see who you belong to.
<br/>
"Mexican Police Force"?
<br/>
I wonder if they'd let us
borrow you for a little while.
<br/>
We sure could use your nose on a couple
of cases. What do you boys think?
<br/>
OK, OK. Let me give 'em a call.
<br/>
You want me to stay?
<br/>
Yeah, I think we have
a lot of catching up to do.
<br/>
- Come on, guys.
- It's great to have you back, Dad.
<br/>
It looks like you're gonna be
a Beverly Hills dog, Delgado.
<br/>
Thanks for everything, princesa.
You have a beautiful family.
<br/>
And thanks to them,
I have my family back, too.
<br/>
I'm sure I'll see you around.
<br/>
And I can't wait for next year's dog
show. What do you say, Delgado?
<br/>
In your dreams, kid. Adiós.
<br/>
Load up.
<br/>
And you, too.
<br/>
There you guys are.
<br/>
I know. I missed you, too.
<br/>
Don't worry, we're leaving.
You didn't have to bring the police.
<br/>
We're not going
to cause you guys any trouble.
<br/>
Can you give us one second of
your time, please?
<br/>
Hey! You know, your dogs
are pretty special.
<br/>
They solved the case
that stumped an entire task force.
<br/>
We been trackin' these criminals
for three months.
<br/>
They got over 15 million dollars
from banks in the area.
<br/>
And there is a $250,000 reward
for their capture.
<br/>
Which is yours. It'll probably pay off
the loan on your house and then some.
<br/>
- Hey, guys! Come quick! Check this out.
- What's going on?
<br/>
Is this a joke?
'Cause I'm not laughing.
<br/>
I can assure you, Mr Cortez,
this is not a joke.
<br/>
In fact, you can come down to the bank
this week and sign the papers.
<br/>
And... here's your pen back.
Sorry about that.
<br/>
You know what, those never work.
Take this one. OK.
<br/>
Holy guacamole! We did it!
We saved the house!
<br/>
Gracias. Oh, my goodness.
<br/>
No, I'm fine. Really, that's...
<br/>
You don't really have...
OK, we're hugging it out.
<br/>
I'm having a hard time breathing.
That's great. Please let go.
<br/>
- Yes.
- What are we waiting for? Let's unpack.
<br/>
- Unpack.
- I'm gonna stay out here.
<br/>
Come on, guys!
Let's show him some love!
<br/>
Oh, no-no-no. No, no, no.
No-no-no. Good dogs!
<br/>
- Good dogs...
- Dogpile!
<br/>
Bad dogs. Bad dogs.
I'm really not a dog person.
<br/>
My kitty's going to be very jealous.
<br/>
- Come in, Rachel.
- Hi.
<br/>
I called her. A mother
wants to see her son happy.
<br/>
- I'm so sorry, Rachel.
- No, I'm sorry.
<br/>
I hated the way we left things.
<br/>
I wanna be with you,
whether we're married or not.
<br/>
And I want to be with you... forever.
<br/>
I wanna have a family with you.
<br/>
I wanna depend on each other
for the rest of our lives.
<br/>
Go for it, Sam.
<br/>
Rachel, will you marry me?
<br/>
Yes. Yes, of course!
<br/>
And I'm throwing the wedding!
<br/>
Viv!
<br/>
Oh, congratulations.
<br/>
Let's celebrate!
<br/>
OK, kids, ready to play?
Marco!
<br/>
Polo!
<br/>
- Marco!
- Polo!
<br/>
You can't catch me.
<br/>
Come on, let's join in the fun.
<br/>
Micorazón, be careful, the mud.
Wait here.
<br/>
Oh, Papi, you're so romantic.
<br/>
But of course.
After all, I am a Chihuahua.
<br/>
Don't I know it.
<br/>
Papi likes.
<br/>
Every pet deserves a loving
and permanent home.
<br/>
So if you're adopting a pet,
<br/>
please be sure you are ready
for a lifetime commitment,
<br/>
and please adopt responsibly.
<br/>
Gracias and thank you.
