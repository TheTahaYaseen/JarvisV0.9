Got some.
<br/>  
- Dad peed in his pants.
- Get used to it, son.
<br/>  
When I'm old,
you'll have to change my diaper.
<br/>  
Another year over. I can't believe it.
<br/>  
I can't believe our sons are 7.
<br/>  
In a couple years,
they'll be starting a band...
<br/>  
...growing their hair long...
<br/>  
...stealing your Suburban
to go on tour.
<br/>  
Charlie, we have ourselves
a situation.
<br/>  
Okay, I'll be a minute.
<br/>  
Phil. Phil.
<br/>  
Rare. Good. See?
<br/>  
Save room for cake.
<br/>  
Never mind that on the cake.
<br/>  
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, slow down.
<br/>  
It was the end of Summer Olympiad
between us and our rival camp.
<br/>  
The final event: The relay race.
<br/>  
Coming down the stretch,
I was flying like the wind.
<br/>  
You were sweating sheets of rain.
<br/>  
You could barely move
in a straight line.
<br/>  
- I was still in the lead.
- Whatever.
<br/>  
I hand the baton to Charlie,
he drops it, we lose everything.
<br/>  
Then Lance Warner flew
right past you to the finish line.
<br/>  
I hated that snot-nosed little brat.
He's why I didn't have a good time.
<br/>  
Honey, why is Ben going on and on
about going off to camp?
<br/>  
The permission slip's been
on the fridge for three weeks.
<br/>  
He really wants to go,
and I think he should.
<br/>  
Well, Phil and I have talked,
the boys aren't going.
<br/>  
- What do you mean?
- I mean, they're not going.
<br/>  
All those snakes and spiders
and wedgies.
<br/>  
Just because you had
a bad experience as a kid at camp...
<br/>  
...doesn't mean
our son will have one too.
<br/>  
- What are you talking about?
- I was there. You were scarred for life.
<br/>  
I'm on the ground,
staring up at my father.
<br/>  
He stands there
with a look of disapproval.
<br/>  
Just over some stupid camp game.
<br/>  
I won't allow my son to let
anything like that happen to him.
<br/>  
He will know I love and support him
no matter what.
<br/>  
Good. Then you can love
and support him going to camp.
<br/>  
You didn't hear what I just said?
<br/>  
Yes, I did, and he's not you,
and you definitely are not your father.
<br/>  
Oh, and you're driving them.
<br/>  
There it is. Camp Canola.
<br/>  
You don't want to go to rival Canola.
<br/>  
But that's where everyone goes.
<br/>  
No, if you wanna go to camp,
you wanna go to Driftwood.
<br/>  
Yeah, Camp Canola's
some rundown shack...
<br/>  
...on a piece of swamp land.
<br/>  
At least, it used to be.
<br/>  
- Cool.
- Awesome.
<br/>  
It's a lake. I don't remember a lake.
<br/>  
Well, this ain't nothing.
<br/>  
Wait till you see
where you are going.
<br/>  
Camp Driftwood.
<br/>  
What the heck?
<br/>  
Yeah, well, you're crazy, Morty.
That's the best offer...
<br/>  
...you're ever gonna get
for this craphole.
<br/>  
I'm doing you a favour, butthead.
You're crazy, Morty.
<br/>  
- Are you folks lost?
- No, we're here to check out the camp.
<br/>  
You want to bring your kids here?
<br/>  
That's beautiful.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
Hey, good luck with that.
<br/>  
Okay, kids, come on.
<br/>  
Didn't you hear? Camp's closed.
<br/>  
- Yes.
- Yes.
<br/>  
What happened?
This place used to be the best.
<br/>  
Well, now seems
like everybody wants newer, better...
<br/>  
...properly licensed and bonded.
<br/>  
They want Camp Canola
down the road.
<br/>  
You guys went to Driftwood?
<br/>  
Yeah, we were here
when we were kids.
<br/>  
Then you know. This place really used
to be something special.
<br/>  
And Canola was a dump.
Then some rich family bought it...
<br/>  
...eventually turned it over
to that mutant son of theirs.
<br/>  
What's gonna happen to Driftwood?
<br/>  
Well, soon I'm gonna have no choice
but to sell it to Canola.
<br/>  
It's a pity. Because all he wants
to do is bulldoze over it.
<br/>  
Can you believe it?
<br/>  
That kid has been a pain in my heinie
since he won the '77 Olympiad.
<br/>  
I just hate to give that jerk
Lance Warner the satisfaction.
<br/>  
Warner? Lance Warner?
<br/>  
He wants to buy this camp
and tear it down?
<br/>  
Our camp?
<br/>  
You bought a what?
<br/>  
Not the whole camp,
a partnership with the original owner.
<br/>  
I know the day care centre
has been successful...
<br/>  
...but you've spent a lot
fixing this house up...
<br/>  
...to accommodate more kids.
<br/>  
The Daddy Day Care brand
means a lot in this town.
<br/>  
Re-purposing that brand into summer
is just smart business.
<br/>  
Do you know how to run a camp?
<br/>  
That's just it. I'm not gonna run
the camp, Uncle Morty is.
<br/>  
Phil and I are just gonna help out.
<br/>  
So I'll spend as much time
with Ben as possible.
<br/>  
But you hate the outdoors.
<br/>  
Yes, but I hate Lance Warner more.
No way my son's going to his camp.
<br/>  
Please just send him to Canola.
That's where all his friends are.
<br/>  
No. No way.
<br/>  
Listen, my father sent me to camp
and it didn't go so great. Okay?
<br/>  
Maybe I can give Ben
the positive experience I never had.
<br/>  
Just promise me you'll let...
<br/>  
...this Uncle Morty do
the real outdoorsy stuff.
<br/>  
I don't wanna have to send
a search party...
<br/>  
...to come rescue your lost butt
in the woods.
<br/>  
Come on, Sally, now,
don't play hard to get.
<br/>  
Oh, you little tease.
<br/>  
Oh, you... I've gotcha.
<br/>  
It's another beautiful
woodchuck day, baby. 
<br/>  
Hey, that's great.
You remember the old cheer.
<br/>  
I can't thank you guys enough.
I mean, you saved the old place.
<br/>  
Yeah, well, with your help,
I'll show that Lance Warner...
<br/>  
...how to run a good
old-fashioned summer camp.
<br/>  
Swell. I'll see you guys
in September.
<br/>  
Say what, now?
<br/>  
Uncle Morty?
<br/>  
Excuse me. Morty, you can't leave.
<br/>  
You're supposed to be overseeing
the camp. We're partners.
<br/>  
I've been watching over this camp
for 30 years.
<br/>  
It's time I took a vacation, partner.
<br/>  
Don't worry.
Dale here will show you the ropes.
<br/>  
- He's the best counsellor I got.
- No, Morty, wait. You can't leave.
<br/>  
Wait. Come back.
<br/>  
What was that about?
<br/>  
This is my first day.
<br/>  
Charles Hinton?
<br/>  
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm from FM J Bank.
<br/>  
No doubt your uncle Morty
informed you of the liens...
<br/>  
...we have against your property.
- Informed?
<br/>  
He just took his little fishy
up the road.
<br/>  
As the business has no clients...
<br/>  
...therefore no discernible
means of income...
<br/>  
...the bank will have no choice
but to foreclose on the property.
<br/>  
- Foreclose?
- Foreclose?
<br/>  
Let me ask you something.
<br/>  
What if this camp could show
discernible means of income?
<br/>  
Continue.
<br/>  
We have run
the Daddy Day Care Center...
<br/>  
...successfully
for the past several years.
<br/>  
Allow us to use the hard-earned trust
that name brings...
<br/>  
...to build in new clientele.
<br/>  
I suppose I could recommend
to the bank...
<br/>  
...that we extend the debt
for about a month.
<br/>  
Assuming, of course,
that you can maintain the camp...
<br/>  
...and a client base
of at least 30 children.
<br/>  
We'll have it in tiptop shape
in no time.
<br/>  
Yeah, you got a methane problem,
all right.
<br/>  
Gonna have to have
that baby pumped.
<br/>  
Oh, crap.
<br/>  
Yeah, you said it. Gonna need
a whole new septic tank...
<br/>  
...new plumbing, the works.
Cost you about 14.
<br/>  
- Hundred?
- Thousand.
<br/>  
You know what?
We'll buy the kids gas masks.
<br/>  
It's your party, pally,
but that methane is dangerous.
<br/>  
You boys best be careful.
<br/>  
- Phil.
- What? That wasn't me.
<br/>  
Okay, here's your lunch, sweetie.
<br/>  
It's a sugar-free, wheat-free,
gluten-free, tofu nugget.
<br/>  
You have your Sidekick with text,
GPS locator in case you get lost...
<br/>  
...and waterproof sunscreen,
in case it gets sunny...
<br/>  
...while it's still raining.
- Mother, it's day camp.
<br/>  
I'll be seven miles away.
<br/>  
And home before dinner.
<br/>  
Did you take your Xanax?
<br/>  
I don't wanna go to camp in the rain.
<br/>  
I wanna stay home
watching nudie flicks.
<br/>  
The brochure said there would be sun.
Please behave yourself.
<br/>  
And for the love of God,
try not to make anyone bleed.
<br/>  
Take your Dramamine now
before you get on the bus...
<br/>  
...then later if you ride a horse...
<br/>  
...or anything that bounces
or gently sways.
<br/>  
- What about my Pepto?
- Save that for lunch.
<br/>  
And your Beano,
in case you have a snack.
<br/>  
It's another beautiful woodchuck day. 
<br/>  
Promise you'll put those games away
and try to be social this summer.
<br/>  
Die, alien scum, die.
<br/>  
Carl, please don't let the other kids
tease your brother.
<br/>  
What am I? Dr. Phil?
<br/>  
I've got nothing to work with here.
<br/>  
Archibald Lawrence Mapleton?
<br/>  
Call me, Mullet. Business up front,
party in the back, baby.
<br/>  
Juliette Stone?
<br/>  
Present.
<br/>  
Holy Hogwarts.
<br/>  
Watch the merchandise, dude.
<br/>  
- I still got it, huh?
- I can't hear! My ears!
<br/>  
Okay, this is it. Time to give them
a summer they'll never forget.
<br/>  
They won't forget that.
<br/>  
Nature walkers, lotion up.
<br/>  
Okay, Robin Hoods, gather around.
<br/>  
Everybody take a bow.
<br/>  
There you go.
<br/>  
There's enough for everyone.
There you go.
<br/>  
Hey, Romeo.
If you like her, go in that group.
<br/>  
No. That's okay.
I've only got to kill one more Orc.
<br/>  
Right. Kill your Orc, you dork.
<br/>  
Dad, I want to be
in the group with Max.
<br/>  
I'm older than these babies.
I should be in that group.
<br/>  
I didn't sign up to be with no skirts.
<br/>  
They got cooties.
<br/>  
There's no such thing as cooties.
<br/>  
It's simply a term used to express
age-appropriate discomfort...
<br/>  
...of those not of our gender.
<br/>  
Stop arguing.
<br/>  
You wanted to accommodate children
of all ages.
<br/>  
Well, at this point,
we can't be too picky.
<br/>  
Look, here we have grass.
Some grass and a big rock.
<br/>  
How many more to go?
<br/>  
Everybody gather round. Get in here.
<br/>  
Can anyone tell me
what kind of tree this is?
<br/>  
An oak?
<br/>  
Yeah. Sure. Okay.
<br/>  
Look over here, some berries,
maybe a strawberry thing.
<br/>  
I wouldn't eat them, though.
Watch out.
<br/>  
Poison ivy. Keep moving, slowly,
behind the bush.
<br/>  
Come on, slowly. Don't touch it.
<br/>  
Careful, careful. Okay.
<br/>  
That would be a leaf.
<br/>  
Ready. Aim.
<br/>  
Wait. There's a bunny.
<br/>  
We can't shoot with a bunny
in the field.
<br/>  
He's way off to the side.
You'll never hit it.
<br/>  
Yes, we can. That's good eating.
<br/>  
No, it's not.
<br/>  
Wait. All right, kids, hang on.
Back up.
<br/>  
So the rebel Borg rogue vessel...
<br/>  
...circles around Barkon IV...
<br/>  
...loops over the Enterprise
and doubles back...
<br/>  
...through the space nebula.
<br/>  
We passed this tree twice already.
<br/>  
Because it's a very important tree
and I wanted to emphasise it.
<br/>  
We're not lost.
<br/>  
- Alligator.
- Calm down. Stop. Calm down.
<br/>  
Stop.
<br/>  
We don't have alligators
on the nature hike.
<br/>  
It's not that good a camp.
<br/>  
See, kids?
Everything's gonna be just fine.
<br/>  
Air varmint.
<br/>  
I appreciate that you kids
are such quick learners...
<br/>  
...but these knots are not supposed
to be used for evil.
<br/>  
See? Just a big, dumb empty log.
<br/>  
Bees. Scatter.
<br/>  
Now put two thumbs up.
<br/>  
You guys, two, three,
or four of you are out...
<br/>  
...because I didn't say, "Simon says. "
<br/>  
All right, Simon Says.
<br/>  
Ben. Hey, Ben.
<br/>  
Simon says, "Wave at Daddy. "
<br/>  
Good concentration, son.
You know, because I'm not Simon.
<br/>  
Good job, Dale.
<br/>  
Oh, no, so many are out right now,
I can't even count how many.
<br/>  
- Can I help you?
- Felix.
<br/>  
Simon Says. A classic.
<br/>  
I was showing the kids here...
<br/>  
...where the go-cart track will be...
<br/>  
...once you and your team of idiots
run your camp into the ground.
<br/>  
First of all, it's not for sale.
<br/>  
Yeah, well, from what I heard,
that may not be up to you.
<br/>  
Yeah, a little something
called foreclosure.
<br/>  
Axe coming down.
<br/>  
See all those kids
running around down there?
<br/>  
Does that look like
a business in trouble?
<br/>  
It's only day one, buddy boy.
<br/>  
Once all those kids see how much fun
we're having at Camp Canola...
<br/>  
...they'll be jumping ship
like harbour rats.
<br/>  
And to make matters worse...
<br/>  
...you will never be able
to beat the Chief in the Olympiad.
<br/>  
That's him. He's the Chief.
<br/>  
And you poop in your shorts.
<br/>  
Nice son you got there, Lance.
<br/>  
He ain't my kid. I hate kids.
<br/>  
First of all, there ain't gonna be
any Olympiad. And secondly...
<br/>  
...I care about building these kids up,
not tearing them down...
<br/>  
...with some futile attempt
at competition.
<br/>  
That's pathetic.
<br/>  
You won't last a month.
<br/>  
Yeah. Thirty-one days. Or 30.
<br/>  
Except for February,
which stands alone.
<br/>  
All right, let's go.
<br/>  
Dang, he looks familiar.
<br/>  
All right, Camp Canola.
<br/>  
Let's head out.
<br/>  
Wait. Oh, good Lord.
<br/>  
Watch and learn.
<br/>  
- Mullet. Come on.
- Hurry up.
<br/>  
I want candy.
<br/>  
Dale, make sure
you count them twice.
<br/>  
Everybody on the...
Hey, no fighting.
<br/>  
On the bus. Get on the bus.
<br/>  
Oh, thank God.
<br/>  
See? This is exactly
where I thought we'd come out.
<br/>  
Get down to the bus.
It'll be leaving any second.
<br/>  
I've gotta drop the kids off
at the pool.
<br/>  
We have a pool?
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
This is the worst camp ever.
<br/>  
Thanks for coming.
<br/>  
No, no, Max.
All right, no, Max, Max.
<br/>  
Okay, off the bus.
Everybody off the bus.
<br/>  
Yes, off the bus. Okay. Okay. Relax.
<br/>  
What's wrong with him?
<br/>  
He was born with no sense of smell.
<br/>  
What's his problem?
<br/>  
- Mayhoffer's gonna blow.
- What?
<br/>  
Phil, we got a situation here.
I need help. 
<br/>  
I need backup. I repeat, backup for... 
<br/>  
All right.
<br/>  
Code blue. Code blue, Phil.
<br/>  
- What else could go wrong?
- No, please...
<br/>  
I think we're gonna need
more toilet paper.
<br/>  
Baby...
<br/>  
...it's just not your area of expertise.
<br/>  
You need someone
with more outdoor experience.
<br/>  
Someone like your father.
<br/>  
You're gonna call Grandpa?
<br/>  
No. Mommy's just making a joke.
<br/>  
I don't need Buck.
<br/>  
Kids all over town are bathing
in tomato juice, thanks to you.
<br/>  
It was one lousy skunk
and a harmless methane explosion.
<br/>  
Your father's a military man.
<br/>  
You told me yourself Buck knows
everything about the outdoors.
<br/>  
Roughing it, managing troops,
survival skills.
<br/>  
Yeah, and he realises it
through anger, shaming, and criticism.
<br/>  
Here, baby, sponge yourself.
<br/>  
Look, I know that you two have had
your problems.
<br/>  
Problems? No.
<br/>  
Nothing I ever did was good enough,
including sports, school, work.
<br/>  
But other than that?
<br/>  
He could help,
and Ben would be thrilled to see him.
<br/>  
I think it's time you give him a chance.
<br/>  
Look, baby, this is my thing, okay?
I'll handle it.
<br/>  
Phil and I got special
camp consultants coming tomorrow.
<br/>  
It's a fresh start and a new day.
<br/>  
Consultants?
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
- It's all right here in our Idea Binders.
- That's for you.
<br/>  
You just trust us.
<br/>  
- Syl. Come to me.
- I'm right here.
<br/>  
Be with me, think with me.
<br/>  
We could have
this entire area carpeted.
<br/>  
Shag carpet.
<br/>  
Like a child, a universe grows.
<br/>  
That was a waste of time.
<br/>  
Hey, don't worry.
When those 35 kids get off that bus...
<br/>  
...we're gonna show them adventure,
Charlie and Phil style.
<br/>  
Okay. See, Phil, it's all we needed.
A new day, fresh start.
<br/>  
Way to go, Dad.
<br/>  
What?
<br/>  
That's all we got. The other parents
are demanding a full refund.
<br/>  
Let's go this way, guys.
<br/>  
We only got seven kids left, Phil.
<br/>  
There's no other way
to cover these bills.
<br/>  
We can't afford to hire consultants...
<br/>  
...much less make
the foreclosure payment.
<br/>  
We can't even afford to give refunds.
That money went back into repairs.
<br/>  
You're gonna have
to swallow your pride...
<br/>  
...and get a man in here
to help run this camp.
<br/>  
Historically,
the art of using troops is this:
<br/>  
When ten to the enemy's one,
surround them with tanks.
<br/>  
At five times the strength,
you attack with air strikes.
<br/>  
Napoleon: All manoeuvres were
on horseback.
<br/>  
Saladin: Camels...
<br/>  
Colonel here.
<br/>  
Just a sec.
<br/>  
Civilians, you're dismissed.
<br/>  
That's better. How can I help you?
<br/>  
No, no. No, the time is fine.
<br/>  
You don't say?
<br/>  
And that's how you treat
an acute poison ivy breakout.
<br/>  
I'd like to apologise to you guys
for letting you play...
<br/>  
...in what I thought was clover.
<br/>  
Jack, I wouldn't go number two
for a few weeks if I were you.
<br/>  
I think you used that "clover"
for toilet paper.
<br/>  
If you'd all sign these waivers...
<br/>  
...acknowledging you've been briefed
on safety...
<br/>  
- Here you go. Okay.
- Excuse me.
<br/>  
With the exception
of emancipated minors...
<br/>  
...I don't believe
that a personal injury waiver...
<br/>  
...with confidentiality clause,
executed by a child...
<br/>  
...is a legally binding document,
Uncle Phil.
<br/>  
It's a raid.
<br/>  
Camp Canola!
<br/>  
Get the flag.
<br/>  
I can use the second mortgage
on the house...
<br/>  
...to pay off the bills for the camp?
<br/>  
Great. No, Mr. Thumson,
I don't need you to come out here.
<br/>  
No, business is fine. It's just...
<br/>  
You know,
we have such a full house.
<br/>  
Can I call you back?
<br/>  
What the heck is going on here?
<br/>  
Open your ear-holes, dweebers.
<br/>  
"We, the mighty troops of Fort Canola,
have braved hill and dale...
<br/>  
...so that we may find...
<br/>  
...who are the greatest warriors
in the land. "
<br/>  
No. No. No way.
<br/>  
You are way out of line, Lance.
<br/>  
Behold!
<br/>  
This spear of honour...
<br/>  
...garnished with the flame of truth.
<br/>  
Now, I challenge ye...
<br/>  
...to the XLV Annual
Intercamp Olympiad.
<br/>  
That's the 37th Olympiad to you,
pea brain.
<br/>  
Forty-fifth.
<br/>  
I told you before, there isn't going
to be any competition.
<br/>  
Well, then let the onslaught continue.
<br/>  
Now's your chance.
Go say something.
<br/>  
Do you like World of Warcraft?
<br/>  
World of what?
<br/>  
I'm a Level 40 Blood Elf Druid.
<br/>  
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.
<br/>  
Goodbye.
<br/>  
I like causing destruction,
not cleaning up after it.
<br/>  
Is that why you threw a paint grenade
at your own campmate during a raid?
<br/>  
What can I say?
War is hell, skunk-boy.
<br/>  
Fight. Fight. Fight. 
<br/>  
Fight. Fight. Fight. 
<br/>  
Cut it out. Stop it. Stop fighting.
<br/>  
A ten-hut.
<br/>  
I see this unit's morale is flagging.
<br/>  
There is only one solution for that.
<br/>  
All of those who are my grandson,
front and centre.
<br/>  
- Come here, you little peanut.
- Grandpa Buck.
<br/>  
Do you remember this manoeuvre?
<br/>  
Sneak attack at tickle point.
<br/>  
Everyone, this is my father,
Colonel Buck Hinton.
<br/>  
- Reporting for duty, corporal.
- Please don't call me that.
<br/>  
All right, then, private.
<br/>  
Gentlemen. Ladies.
What I just witnessed was a mutiny.
<br/>  
Among campers,
that is unacceptable...
<br/>  
...from this point forward.
<br/>  
Now...
<br/>  
...front and centre. Double time.
<br/>  
I'll make you soldiers
if it's the last thing I do.
<br/>  
No, wait a minute. There is no mutiny.
Everything is under control.
<br/>  
This is not why I called you.
<br/>  
- Why the misconduct, soldier?
- We got raided by Camp Canola.
<br/>  
- Yeah.
- Sneak attack, huh?
<br/>  
Well, I'm sorry, private.
<br/>  
We should be planning
a counterattack.
<br/>  
Meet force with force.
I say we hit them at nightfall.
<br/>  
- Yeah.
- No. No.
<br/>  
Driftwood Day Camp.
<br/>  
Hit them at 5,
when the sun's in their eyes.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
Okay, guys.
<br/>  
Guys, can you excuse us
for a minute?
<br/>  
This is not a boot camp. All right?
<br/>  
We're not looking for Colonel Hinton,
war games consultant.
<br/>  
We're looking for Colonel Hinton,
experienced team builder...
<br/>  
...slash King of the Outdoors.
<br/>  
We're not trying to turn these kids
into Marines.
<br/>  
What's wrong with being a Marine?
<br/>  
Maybe if you had enlisted...
<br/>  
...you could work yourself out of a jam
instead of calling in reinforcements.
<br/>  
Listen. Yes, I do appreciate
your coming.
<br/>  
Yes, we do need your help.
<br/>  
But we don't want to get into this thing
with Camp Canola.
<br/>  
- No war games?
- No.
<br/>  
Hand-to-hand combat?
<br/>  
- Guerrilla warfare?
- No war.
<br/>  
No war.
<br/>  
Just help us run Driftwood,
all right?
<br/>  
Can you follow those orders, Dad?
<br/>  
That's colonel to you, private.
<br/>  
Line up.
<br/>  
In through the nose.
<br/>  
Out through the mouth.
<br/>  
In through the nose.
<br/>  
Out through the mouth.
<br/>  
The samurai warrior meditates...
<br/>  
...to blend mind
and body into harmony.
<br/>  
Come here. Come to me.
<br/>  
Hey! Hey!
<br/>  
Hey, old man, what's with the séance
in the middle of our off-road track?
<br/>  
What? Get them out of here!
<br/>  
Get your kids out of here!
Get them out of here!
<br/>  
Somebody's gonna get hurt!
<br/>  
Relax, General Depends.
<br/>  
Shouldn't you be
in some bingo game or something?
<br/>  
L-27. G-13.
<br/>  
All right, boys. Let's move them out.
<br/>  
- B-7.
- G-40.
<br/>  
That tears it.
<br/>  
Rules of engagement...
<br/>  
...been overruled.
<br/>  
There's the objective.
Anyone unclear on their role?
<br/>  
No, sir.
<br/>  
- Anyone wanna go home?
- No, sir.
<br/>  
Operation MoonPie is a go.
<br/>  
It's right up here.
<br/>  
You know, I've never been up here.
<br/>  
Help. Help. Come on, y'all.
Give me a lift. Come on, please.
<br/>  
Go, go.
<br/>  
Where is it? Where is it?
I know that loser from somewhere.
<br/>  
Where is it?
<br/>  
Jackpot.
<br/>  
Charlie Hinton.
<br/>  
Can I help you?
<br/>  
- Hi, my name's Becca.
- I'm Juliette.
<br/>  
And we've come to offer you...
<br/>  
...the Driftwood
Olive Branch of Peace.
<br/>  
In exchange for our friendship...
<br/>  
...all we ask is
that you return our flag.
<br/>  
Did big bad Charlie send
his little bitty girls...
<br/>  
...to do his bidding for him, huh?
<br/>  
Let's put it this way:
Either you give it back...
<br/>  
...or we take it.
<br/>  
You and what army, Petunia?
<br/>  
You had to ask.
<br/>  
Ask what?
<br/>  
What the...?
<br/>  
Get him.
<br/>  
You're messing with Lance Warner.
<br/>  
Stuck.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
Hey, Warner.
<br/>  
- Yes.
- That's my boy.
<br/>  
Sound the alarm. Red alert.
<br/>  
We're under attack.
This is not a drill, people.
<br/>  
Everyone to your stations!
Security's been breached!
<br/>  
The perimeter's
been compromised!
<br/>  
Lock the gates! Call my dad!
<br/>  
Hey, Dale, you seen Buck?
<br/>  
Supposed to be back
with the kids an hour ago.
<br/>  
I wouldn't sweat it.
<br/>  
Your dad's like
the most responsible guy I ever met.
<br/>  
Yeah, you're probably right.
<br/>  
Get back here, you little rodents.
<br/>  
Come on. Come on.
<br/>  
No! No, no, no.
Give me my pants back.
<br/>  
Here's your diaper.
<br/>  
Clean yourself off.
<br/>  
Move out.
<br/>  
Let go. Get back here, you cowards.
<br/>  
No one messes with Lance Warner,
you hear me?
<br/>  
No one.
<br/>  
G.I. Joe is turning red. 
<br/>  
Someone farted on his head. 
<br/>  
G.I. Joe is turning pink. 
<br/>  
Someone puked in the kitchen sink. 
<br/>  
G.I. Joe is turning white.
<br/>  
The zippers on his pants
are really tight. 
<br/>  
G.I. Joe is turning blue.
<br/>  
There are peanuts in his poo. 
<br/>  
Company, halt.
<br/>  
Where have you guys been?
<br/>  
Your nature hike was supposed
to be back an hour ago.
<br/>  
Present colours.
<br/>  
- You didn't?
- Yes, sir.
<br/>  
Robert, what happened
to your head?
<br/>  
It's just a battle wound.
<br/>  
Dale, go get the first-aid kit.
<br/>  
You take these kids off our premises
without permission slips...
<br/>  
...and bring them back like this?
<br/>  
Affirmative.
<br/>  
See, this is exactly the thing
I was afraid of.
<br/>  
We restored our honour, Dad.
It was just...
<br/>  
What kind of insane militant
nut factory you running here, huh?
<br/>  
Huh, Charlie Hinton?
Driftwood Class of '77.
<br/>  
- That's right, I know who you are.
- Listen, Lance.
<br/>  
I'm really sorry about this.
In fact...
<br/>  
...my father and I were just about
to have a discussion about it.
<br/>  
This is your father?
<br/>  
Oh, this is classic. Oh, sure.
<br/>  
The chicken's come home
to roost, huh?
<br/>  
Now I know why you don't want
to compete in the Olympiad.
<br/>  
You're afraid of getting
your butt kicked again...
<br/>  
...in front of Lieutenant Prune Juice.
<br/>  
Colonel.
<br/>  
Oh, Colonel. Sorry.
<br/>  
Look, Lance, I'm just trying to teach
these kids about sportsmanship.
<br/>  
No, the only thing you can teach
these kids is how to lose.
<br/>  
Or have you forgotten?
<br/>  
"Daddy. Look at me.
<br/>  
I'm a failure. "
<br/>  
You know why my parents bought
Camp Canola for me?
<br/>  
No, why?
<br/>  
Because that summer
when I kicked your butt...
<br/>  
...that was the best moment
of my life.
<br/>  
And now, every day when I wake up,
I get to live that dream.
<br/>  
And it is fantastic.
<br/>  
Peaked when you were 11,
did you, Lance?
<br/>  
See, I get it, Charlie.
<br/>  
You don't want your kid
to end up a loser like you.
<br/>  
Like father, like son.
<br/>  
Oh, sure. No, that's cool.
You walk away.
<br/>  
Yeah, because refusing to compete...
<br/>  
...just proves to the community...
<br/>  
...which camp they should send
their kids to.
<br/>  
Mine.
<br/>  
Adiós.
<br/>  
What I'd really like to do
is kick your butt.
<br/>  
Being as we're trying to set
a good example here, mister...
<br/>  
...you got yourself an Olympiad.
<br/>  
Yeah!
<br/>  
Fantastic.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
Good, good job.
<br/>  
The great Julius Caesar
once said...
<br/>  
You were way out of line
with what you did today.
<br/>  
If we do this, we do it my way.
You got it?
<br/>  
- Affirmative.
- Good.
<br/>  
Now. What do you think
we should do?
<br/>  
A sleepover?
<br/>  
I thought the whole purpose
of day camp...
<br/>  
...was sending the kids home
at the end of the day.
<br/>  
It was your idea to get
my father involved.
<br/>  
According to Buck,
the best way to build team unity...
<br/>  
...is to put the kids in a new situation
where they have to work together...
<br/>  
...to overcome stuff.
<br/>  
Well, I think someone wants
to impress his own father.
<br/>  
Listen, this Olympiad is gonna
be good for business.
<br/>  
Once those Canola parents see
how well our kids work together...
<br/>  
...we might drum up new customers.
<br/>  
If you think parents
are gonna switch camps...
<br/>  
...based off of wins
some silly events...
<br/>  
Mrs. Hinton?
I'm Edward Thumson from the bank.
<br/>  
Yes, I'm aware of who you are,
but what are you doing in my house?
<br/>  
Is that real Tiffany crystal?
<br/>  
It is standard procedure to do...
<br/>  
...a pre-inventory
prior to the foreclosure.
<br/>  
But the first instalment is not due
until next week.
<br/>  
True. But with only six campers...
<br/>  
...it is mathematically impossible for...
- Actually, there's seven campers.
<br/>  
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'll tell you what's going on.
<br/>  
We overextended ourselves
with the camp.
<br/>  
Now strange men are touching
the furniture...
<br/>  
...messing with my mama's vase...
<br/>  
...Mr. Thumson's threatening
to take my house away.
<br/>  
Okay, okay.
<br/>  
- I know what I gotta do.
- What?
<br/>  
- I'll sell the camp.
- Listen to me.
<br/>  
If you believe by winning
this Olympiad...
<br/>  
...more kids will come to the camp...
<br/>  
...then you go kick
some Lance Warner butt.
<br/>  
Come on. Come on, soldier.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
Ben! Hey!
<br/>  
Come on, son.
<br/>  
- I know the song.
- Well, what?
<br/>  
You don't like being
in the support vehicle with me...
<br/>  
...instead of out there with poison ivy,
rocks and whatnot? Bugs.
<br/>  
It's supposed to be a hike.
I look like a goober.
<br/>  
Okay. You're right.
<br/>  
Oh, look at her.
<br/>  
She even puts on bug spray
like an angel.
<br/>  
You're pathetic. Go walk with her.
Get your groove on, dude.
<br/>  
What makes you such an expert?
You're only 6.
<br/>  
I know I won't spend
my best years buried in video games.
<br/>  
Shut up. Don't make...
<br/>  
Here, buddy.
<br/>  
Stop it. Stop it.
<br/>  
Hey, Billy? What's going on?
<br/>  
Nothing.
<br/>  
No wet willies to dish out?
<br/>  
Maybe you could switch over
to the purple nurple.
<br/>  
No, I already gave one to Mayhoffer.
<br/>  
It's just... I don't like sleepovers.
That's all.
<br/>  
And why is that?
<br/>  
Come on, Billy, you can always trust
a fat guy. I won't tell anybody.
<br/>  
Cross my heart, hope to diet.
<br/>  
- I sometimes wet the bed.
- What?
<br/>  
I sometimes wet the bed.
<br/>  
You know what?
<br/>  
I had the same problem
till I was darn near 10.
<br/>  
Really? What did you do
at sleepovers?
<br/>  
An excellent question,
my young friend.
<br/>  
I think you'll be intrigued
by the answer.
<br/>  
Get that equipment up, Brown.
<br/>  
This is dumb.
Why we gotta walk so far?
<br/>  
Far? Halt.
<br/>  
Now you listen up, hippie-hair.
<br/>  
How are you gonna compete
against Camp Canola...
<br/>  
...tomorrow morning
with that kind of attitude?
<br/>  
We have 12 events staring at us
dead in the eye.
<br/>  
We have got to toughen up.
<br/>  
When I was your age, I used to march
six miles into the woods...
<br/>  
...just to spend the night alone
in a tree. Focus on a goal.
<br/>  
I used to put rocks in my backpack...
<br/>  
...just to get stronger.
<br/>  
That's how you grow up to be a man.
Ain't that right, Ben?
<br/>  
All right. Let's head out.
<br/>  
Forward, march.
<br/>  
Hey, Ben.
What are you doing there, son?
<br/>  
Nothing.
<br/>  
I'm so full.
<br/>  
I'm fuller than you.
<br/>  
No one's as full as me.
<br/>  
But now I've got room for dessert.
Who wants S'mores?
<br/>  
Anything I can help you with?
<br/>  
Can't find the chocolate
or the marshmallows.
<br/>  
What are you talking about?
They're in my bag.
<br/>  
Who wants chocolate?
<br/>  
What are we gonna roast?
<br/>  
Nice job, Hinton.
Your dad is such a schwing.
<br/>  
I gotta roast something
with a pit in it.
<br/>  
Shut up. I don't like it
any more than you do.
<br/>  
It's not my fault.
<br/>  
Dude, trust me.
<br/>  
A star-filled sky,
the warm glow of a fire...
<br/>  
She'll be like Silly Putty
in your hands.
<br/>  
What makes you such an expert?
<br/>  
Look, you know how grownups
are always saying...
<br/>  
...they wish they knew then
what they know now?
<br/>  
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.
<br/>  
How are we ever gonna beat Canola
with runts like you on our team?
<br/>  
Yeah. What you gonna do, tiny?
Bang your pan until they surrender?
<br/>  
I think I burned my banana.
<br/>  
- Hello.
- Hey.
<br/>  
How are you doing
this fine evening?
<br/>  
Pretty good. Never roasted
a pear before, but it smells good.
<br/>  
Yes, smells are good,
and you, too, smell, Juliette.
<br/>  
I mean, things smell...
<br/>  
I mean, good, you smell.
<br/>  
Sorry, it must have been
from the hike, because...
<br/>  
No, no, I mean...
<br/>  
It's a nice night.
<br/>  
Starry skies, a warm fire.
<br/>  
Good food.
<br/>  
Idiot.
<br/>  
Great place you got there.
What's the mortgage like?
<br/>  
What are you doing?
<br/>  
Sleeping in a hollowed-out log
or something?
<br/>  
It's called camping, private.
You should try it.
<br/>  
Yes, right.
<br/>  
Jack, I think that banana is about
as cooked as it's gonna get there.
<br/>  
It's so slimy.
<br/>  
No, it's roasting.
It's supposed to bring out the flavour.
<br/>  
Try it. You'll like it, I promise.
<br/>  
Good, right?
<br/>  
No!
<br/>  
I'm done with that.
<br/>  
That's nasty.
<br/>  
You feel better?
<br/>  
Sure you're gonna need that, son?
<br/>  
Good Lord's filling the sky
with a million nightlights.
<br/>  
Just for you.
<br/>  
Don't know why you got your panties
in a wad tonight, Mayhoffer.
<br/>  
We're all getting butt spackled
tomorrow anyways.
<br/>  
What are you talking about?
<br/>  
You don't seriously think we can beat
those rich Canola kids?
<br/>  
Yeah, they're gonna cream us.
<br/>  
Cream? Cream is for coffee.
<br/>  
Okay. Listen up, troops.
<br/>  
It's come to my attention some of you
don't believe we can win tomorrow.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
Maybe they have fancy equipment.
Gold-plated toilet paper.
<br/>  
But we got something
those snotty-nosed...
<br/>  
...silver-spoon brats will never have.
<br/>  
- Do you want to know what that is?
- Lice?
<br/>  
Driftwood spirit.
<br/>  
I didn't think you guys had it...
<br/>  
...but the way you pulled yourselves
together today...
<br/>  
...made me prouder
than any platoon I've ever led.
<br/>  
- We couldn't have done it without you.
- Nonsense.
<br/>  
You couldn't have done it
without this.
<br/>  
Because it's Driftwood Camp spirit
that links us all together...
<br/>  
...and makes it all possible.
<br/>  
You're not just a bunch of kids
that came together in camp.
<br/>  
You're a team. Team.
<br/>  
- Team.
- Team.
<br/>  
- Team.
- Team.
<br/>  
Team, team, team!
<br/>  
And listen, team.
<br/>  
Tomorrow, you're gonna take
those lobster-eating...
<br/>  
Yeah!
<br/>  
...those Humvee-driving...
- Yeah!
<br/>  
...Canola cretins and you're gonna
throw them in the dumper.
<br/>  
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
<br/>  
Yeah!
<br/>  
You don't think you're setting them up
for a pretty big letdown?
<br/>  
Well, in order to win the battle...
<br/>  
...one must first believe
in the success of the mission.
<br/>  
It's been a long time
since you've been in battle.
<br/>  
A minor technicality.
<br/>  
Hey, have you guys seen Ben?
I can't find him.
<br/>  
- Ben?
- Ben?
<br/>  
- Ben!
- Ben?
<br/>  
- Ben!
- Are you in there?
<br/>  
- Ben.
- Come out.
<br/>  
Guys, I found him.
<br/>  
Ben.
<br/>  
Ben, get down from there.
What are you doing?
<br/>  
Get down. Where you been, man?
We been looking all over for you.
<br/>  
Listen, don't ever scare me
like that again, you hear me?
<br/>  
I'm okay. I just wanted to be
like Grandpa, that's all.
<br/>  
So you wandered off by yourself?
You know how dangerous that is?
<br/>  
Grandpa said
it's what made him tough...
<br/>  
...so I thought it'd do
the same for me.
<br/>  
What?
<br/>  
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen to me.
<br/>  
Let me tell you something
about being tough, okay?
<br/>  
Being tough doesn't necessarily
make you a hero.
<br/>  
Sometimes tough people grow up
to be arrogant, selfish and stubborn.
<br/>  
You guys just need to be yourselves.
<br/>  
And know that
by being yourselves...
<br/>  
...you're gonna be winners,
no matter what.
<br/>  
Even if we choke like you?
<br/>  
Especially if you choke like me.
<br/>  
Listen.
<br/>  
I want you guys to grow up
to be kind and caring...
<br/>  
...and accepting of people.
<br/>  
Even if they make mistakes.
<br/>  
So, Ben,
don't try to be so tough, okay?
<br/>  
Just try to be your best.
That's all that matters.
<br/>  
- Okay.
- Okay?
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
Okay, my little Olympians,
time to rest up for the big day.
<br/>  
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.
<br/>  
Calling Buck, man,
what was I thinking?
<br/>  
It's the only way he knows, Charlie.
<br/>  
If that means him jeopardising
any more kids, he can keep it.
<br/>  
I don't want Ben to grow up
to be anything like my father.
<br/>  
Let's go.
<br/>  
Shoot.
<br/>  
What the heck is...? Oh, you nasty...
<br/>  
This is a mistake.
<br/>  
Wait for me.
<br/>  
Yes. It worked. I'm dry.
<br/>  
See? Told you, Billy.
<br/>  
You always fool
the bed-wetting goblins...
<br/>  
...if you sleep in your day clothes.
<br/>  
Go play with the kids.
<br/>  
Oh, my neck. I'm so cold.
<br/>  
Feel like a human pincushion.
<br/>  
- Relax, Charlie. Look around.
- Oh, thank you.
<br/>  
Would you look at that?
<br/>  
They're running around,
having a good time.
<br/>  
Oh, Buck's gonna go on and on
about how he was right...
<br/>  
...and I'm way too overprotective.
<br/>  
Buck's not gonna go on and on
about anything.
<br/>  
I haven't seen him all morning.
<br/>  
Sign up for camp, please?
Driftwood?
<br/>  
Hey, do you wanna sign up...? No?
<br/>  
Well, as you can tell, we've obviously
destroyed their camp...
<br/>  
...over the last couple years.
<br/>  
I'm thinking, once we kick
Driftwood's butt one more time...
<br/>  
...this is where
the new hardware goes.
<br/>  
What do you say?
It's gonna be great.
<br/>  
Hey, Chuck E. Cheese!
<br/>  
Getting a little nervous?
<br/>  
Let me give you the on the day's events.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
The Olympiad starts.
Your team sucks. You lose.
<br/>  
The end.
<br/>  
Good luck, Lance.
<br/>  
I don't need luck.
<br/>  
Okay, I'll take it from here.
<br/>  
Forfeit! I forfeit!
<br/>  
- Have you seen Grandpa Buck?
- Col. Buck has been gone a long time.
<br/>  
Guys, I'm sure he'll be here.
Okay, so just reach to the left.
<br/>  
Stretch.
<br/>  
No news yet on Buck.
Margaret's driving all over town.
<br/>  
But I did find this in your office.
<br/>  
"Charlie, Uncle Sam called
about another job...
<br/>  
...which is just as well, seeing
as things aren't working out here.
<br/>  
Your tough Colonel Buck. "
<br/>  
- I'll keep looking.
- Okay.
<br/>  
Is that from Grandpa?
<br/>  
Yes. Yes, it is.
<br/>  
He's not coming back?
<br/>  
Well, no.
<br/>  
He's the one that showed us
how to do everything.
<br/>  
We're gonna get whupped.
I don't get whupped.
<br/>  
I do the whupping.
<br/>  
We're doomed. Doomed, I tell you.
<br/>  
Wait, wait, wait a minute.
<br/>  
Just because Buck got called away
to serve his country last night...
<br/>  
...doesn't mean we take everything
he taught us and just let it go to waste.
<br/>  
- He deserted us.
- Without so much as a "see you. "
<br/>  
No, no, no. He didn't.
It's here in the letter, listen.
<br/>  
"Dear Ben, Max, Juliette, Robert...
<br/>  
...Carl, Jack, Becca, Billy,
and Mullet:
<br/>  
Sorry to leave in the night
without even saying, 'See you'...
<br/>  
...but it's important
that you don't panic.
<br/>  
The 103rd Airborne is staging
manoeuvres tonight...
<br/>  
...and let's just say they could learn
something about teamwork from you. "
<br/>  
The 103rd was retired
after World War II.
<br/>  
Tell you what?
They're bringing it back.
<br/>  
- We can't do this without Buck.
- Yeah.
<br/>  
Sure we can. You know what?
He would've wanted it that way.
<br/>  
You know why?
Because we're a family.
<br/>  
We'll pull each other up,
because that's what families do.
<br/>  
If family's so important,
why'd Grandpa Buck leave?
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
- Going that well, huh?
- Best day of my life.
<br/>  
Well, Ben seems upset
about Buck leaving.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
You know why grandkids
and grandparents get along so well?
<br/>  
They're united by a common enemy.
<br/>  
Makes sense.
<br/>  
I'm saying, if you and Buck could unite
around each other's strengths...
<br/>  
...Ben could have
the best of both worlds.
<br/>  
Go get them, coach. For all of us.
<br/>  
Good news.
Found this in Buck's cabin.
<br/>  
I'll watch after the kids.
You go make things right.
<br/>  
Thanks.
<br/>  
You missed your train.
<br/>  
I missed a train.
<br/>  
Haven't really decided
which one I'm getting on yet.
<br/>  
I thought you had
to be back for manoeuvres.
<br/>  
That's true, but next year.
<br/>  
That's about as often
as they let a broke-down retiree...
<br/>  
...come out and play
with the reservists.
<br/>  
"Retiree. "
<br/>  
About the only action
I get these days...
<br/>  
...is when college students
are doing...
<br/>  
...research papers
on military history.
<br/>  
So...
<br/>  
...you abandoned your post
this morning.
<br/>  
Good soldier knows
when he's in hostile territory.
<br/>  
You heard me last night, didn't you?
<br/>  
I guess I've had a few things
on my mind over the last...
<br/>  
...30 years or so.
<br/>  
I didn't even know you felt that way.
<br/>  
Strange, getting older.
<br/>  
Easier remembering things
the way you wish they were.
<br/>  
I want you to know I'm proud
of the man you've become.
<br/>  
The way you make adjustments
in the field...
<br/>  
...like opening a day care centre
when you lost your job.
<br/>  
Me, I wouldn't be able to do that.
<br/>  
I've always needed more structure.
<br/>  
I'm far from perfect, believe me.
Far from it.
<br/>  
I know one thing though,
those kids are gonna be crushed...
<br/>  
...unless your leathery old butt
comes back.
<br/>  
Do you smell gasoline?
<br/>  
That's right.
<br/>  
Minor setback, people.
We'll get them in the next event.
<br/>  
Wrestling?
Have you seen Max wrestle?
<br/>  
He's right. I suck.
<br/>  
Yeah. And that Canola guy's
hairier than my grandmother's mole.
<br/>  
We're stewed.
<br/>  
Can't we just go home?
This is embarrassing.
<br/>  
No one's going anywhere
until we win this thing.
<br/>  
- Grandpa Buck.
- Yay.
<br/>  
Okay. Hands in, soldiers.
<br/>  
It's another beautiful woodchuck day. 
<br/>  
I knew you'd come back, Grandpa.
We couldn't do this without you.
<br/>  
That's where you're wrong.
Your dad is the hero.
<br/>  
My dad?
<br/>  
Don't you realise he did
all this just for you?
<br/>  
You're pretty lucky
to have Charlie Hinton...
<br/>  
...as a father.
<br/>  
He's a better soldier than I'll ever be.
<br/>  
I could never run a camp
like he can...
<br/>  
...or watch over you
and your mom like he does.
<br/>  
He may be a little overprotective...
<br/>  
...but it's only because he loves you
so much.
<br/>  
- Colonel, we've got a problem.
- Yeah, dude.
<br/>  
What's the situation on the ground,
soldiers?
<br/>  
My calculations suggest
they've cheated in nearly every event.
<br/>  
Cheaters, huh?
<br/>  
Well...
<br/>  
...the only way to beat cheaters
is by outsmarting them.
<br/>  
I've got an idea.
<br/>  
Okay. Okay, okay.
<br/>  
First, we're gonna need the skunk.
<br/>  
Here we go. Come on, good D,
thattaway.
<br/>  
Thattaboy. There we go.
<br/>  
Ref, come on, man. I'm growing old.
<br/>  
Look, here he comes.
<br/>  
Ref. Substitution.
<br/>  
Good job, Robert. Good job.
<br/>  
Yeah, thattaway, purple.
There we go, yeah.
<br/>  
That's too bad, Driftwood.
That's tough luck.
<br/>  
Good hands, though, kid.
Good hands.
<br/>  
We've got a sharpshooter.
We gotta do something.
<br/>  
Give me a balloon.
<br/>  
Billy? The water pump's over there.
<br/>  
No, I'm not filling it with water.
<br/>  
I've been holding this in all night.
<br/>  
You shouldn't pick on kids
smaller than you.
<br/>  
Yeah. Good catch. Good catch.
<br/>  
It's pee! It's pee! It's pee!
<br/>  
It's pee! Mom, it's pee!
<br/>  
Yes!
<br/>  
We're the tiebreaker.
We're gonna get the tiebreaker.
<br/>  
It's another beautiful woodchuck day. 
<br/>  
Suck it up. Let's go.
<br/>  
Jeez, embarrassing.
<br/>  
Okay, let's go get them.
Remember what we talked about.
<br/>  
We need this one.
We need this one.
<br/>  
That look familiar, Charlie?
<br/>  
You lose this,
it's déjà vu all over again.
<br/>  
Yeah, well, I got my best athlete here,
waiting to change history.
<br/>  
Let's go, buddy, come on.
<br/>  
You okay?
<br/>  
I twisted my ankle when I fell.
I could shoot the arrow fine, but...
<br/>  
- But can you climb?
- I don't know. I don't think so.
<br/>  
You can forfeit, Charlie, if you like.
<br/>  
No, no, that's okay.
Who's our best climber?
<br/>  
- I can do it, Dad.
- All right. Come on, son.
<br/>  
You're gonna race that kid.
That's gonna be tough, huh?
<br/>  
- Yeah, real tough.
- Like father, like son, huh?
<br/>  
Don't listen to him. Come on.
<br/>  
All right. Come on, let's go.
<br/>  
- All right.
- Go get him.
<br/>  
Okay, Ben, listen to me.
<br/>  
Whatever you do...
<br/>  
...don't drop the baton, okay?
<br/>  
Ben.
<br/>  
Just enjoy it.
<br/>  
Okay, here it comes.
<br/>  
All right, focus. Here we go.
<br/>  
Come on, Ben.
<br/>  
Go get him.
<br/>  
- Go Ben!
- Go Ben!
<br/>  
- Come on. Get up there.
- Come on, Ben.
<br/>  
- Get them little legs going.
- Come on, Ben.
<br/>  
Go, Ben.
<br/>  
Come on, Ben.
<br/>  
It's okay. It's okay, son.
<br/>  
I told you, you're a loser,
just like your old man.
<br/>  
You're not a loser, Ben.
<br/>  
He greased the wall. He's cheating.
<br/>  
No, don't listen to her.
She's a compulsive liar.
<br/>  
And she steals.
<br/>  
- You cheated.
- You're a cheater. You're a cheater.
<br/>  
Canola cheats. He's cheating.
He's a cheater.
<br/>  
He's a cheater. Canola cheats.
He's a cheater!
<br/>  
Ben, no, no. Get down from there.
That's dangerous, Ben.
<br/>  
Ben. Please, please, Ben.
Ben, get down from there.
<br/>  
No, no, that's dangerous.
Ben, that's dangerous.
<br/>  
Pounce, Bobby J. Here we go.
<br/>  
Up that wall.
<br/>  
Bobby J, go, go, go.
<br/>  
Go!
<br/>  
That's my baby. That is my...
That's my baby. Yeah!
<br/>  
Oh, whoa, hey, what...? Hey.
All right, Bobby J, come here.
<br/>  
- Come here, buddy.
- I did it, Daddy.
<br/>  
- I know it, buddy.
- I love you, Dad.
<br/>  
I love you too, son.
I love you too, you crazy kid.
<br/>  
You call that Canola?
<br/>  
That was embarrassing.
What are you, a moron?
<br/>  
Moron? You're the moron.
<br/>  
Wall coming down.
<br/>  
That's for telling everyone
you're not my dad.
<br/>  
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.
<br/>  
Let's go tell my mom.
She's here to pick me up.
<br/>  
You were really great
in the Egg Relay.
<br/>  
What'd I tell you?
Chicks love gold medallists.
<br/>  
Teach me everything you know.
<br/>  
Well, first you got a bird,
and then you got a bee.
<br/>  
Why?
<br/>  
Why?
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
- Mr. Hinton?
- Hi.
<br/>  
All the parents think
Camp Canola may not set...
<br/>  
...the best example for our children.
<br/>  
And so, if it's not
too short of notice...
<br/>  
...we'd like our kids to come
to your camp as soon as possible.
<br/>  
Too short notice? Don't be silly.
There's room enough for everyone.
<br/>  
Yeah, Dale and I can sign all
you guys up. Welcome.
<br/>  
- It was really my son who did all this.
- Colonel?
<br/>  
Job well done.
<br/>  
Just call me Dad.
<br/>  
Hey, what do you say
we go get the trophy?
<br/>  
- Yeah!
- Okay.
