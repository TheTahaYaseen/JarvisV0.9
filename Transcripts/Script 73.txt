In the Russian woods
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's an evil witch
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People only whisper
of her name in fright
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teeth of sharpened iron
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hands that catch the wind
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Steals the children sleeping
in their beds at night
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She flies in a mortar and pestle
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Through darkened Russian skies
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf you see her
running would be wise
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baba Yaga
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Baba Yaga
- Baba Yaga
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The witch of the Iron Forest
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Her evil is next to none
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baba Yaga
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Baba Yaga
- Baba Yaga
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The wolves are afraid to chase her
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The wind is afraid to race her
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All Russia's afraid to face her
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Except for one
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok: Women and children in front.
Gentlemen behind, please. Don't push.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Plenty of room for everybody, sir.
- Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, don't try this at home.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Part of the show.
Totally planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay with me now, folks,
'cause here comes the good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Once in Mongolia
I noticed a fire
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whole city burnin'
and the flames gettin' higher
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're yelling
"Save us or we're all gonna bake"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I ate the flames
and then I drank the whole lake
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They called me
Bartok the Magnificent
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The specifically
terrifically Magnificent
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A mammal so inflammable
he saved the day
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tell you, B-A-R-T-O-K
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Folks, that's pounds of pressure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go over there at once and put a stop
to that inane little bat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, Ludmilla.
Leave him alone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like him.
He's funny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Your Highness, can you-
- Yes?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you wish.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Leave him be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Folks, this here's a dragon,
an exact replica.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A fire spitter.
Kill you with a flick of the tail.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Careful there, sir.
Better safe than sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One time in Hungary
this dragon appears
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's very "hungary"
No dinner in years
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And then he grabs me
and I'm practically through
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I summon all my strength...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and using the dragon's body weight
against him, I throw him off me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I give him a one to the solar plexus
and a two to the kidneys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He was deflated
'cause I knew my kung fu
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's why
I'm Bartok the Magnificent
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With a " Hah"
and a " Hy-ah" that are significant
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That dragon hasn't eaten
since that fateful day
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to B-A-R-T-O-K
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok the Magnificent
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Undeniably, reliably magnificent
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And heaven help
a harpy who gets in my way
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I'm just a natural
or so they say
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This bat'll
go to battle for you, come what may
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I tell you
- B-A-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
R-T-OOOOOOOOO
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- O-K
- Great crowd. Good people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, please, you're too kind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Show's over.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Thank goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Thank goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey! Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not so fast there, big fella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, really?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Why don't you try this on for size?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abraca- Watch it!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, watch very closely.
There's a half hitch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here's a sailor's breastplate,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and this one's called
"ropin' the bear."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes! Yes!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, thanks a lot, folks, really.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. That's too kind-
Oh! Wow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. That's too kind-
Oh! Wow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bravo! Bravo!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Ivan, that-
that is a ring for a Romanoff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No commoner may ever wear that.
- Why?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because that is
how it has always been.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, perhaps it's time for a change.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, ah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very well, Your Highness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Let us go.
- Thank you for helping my people!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, don't be silly.
It was the least I could do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Bye!
- Wow. Would you look
at the shine on that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can't go around...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
giving royaljewels to commoners,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
especially street performers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You only encourage them.
- Well, I wanted to encourage him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ludmilla, don't be that way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The people like the bat.
Did you see how he made them smile?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It was nice to see them happy.
- Nonsense.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought he was funny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Vol, what do you think?
- I thought so.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When the feathers cleared...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and the bat's standing there
holding a chicken-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That's good stuff.
- See?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or-When he punched the-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Silence.
Yes, Your Highness, I know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But one day you'll be czar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You must show respect
for your crown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't,
how can you expect the peasants to?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your Highness,
are you listening to me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm tired of listening to you,
Ludmilla.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I am the future czar,
then I will do as I choose.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And it is you
who must respect the crown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My apologies.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One for me and one for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One, two, three for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One, two, three...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And one, two, three, four for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- And- Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why do you do that?
I hate when you do that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, that never fails to amuse me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ha ha ha.
- Oh, come now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're certainly not going to let
the fact that I got the better of you...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ruin quite possibly one of
our finer performances to date, hmm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You were inspiring today:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
focused, fully in the moment,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
exceeding well beyond
what your talent would indicate.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Thanks a lot.
- And l-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, suffice it to say
the performance of my death today...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
would have shamed Prometheus.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bound to a cliff-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay. Okay, Zozi,
with the cliff and the thing. Sheesh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you could hear yourself.
It's really quite irritating.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Critics.
And what, pray tell, are you doing now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm divvying up the spoils.
What do you mean?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This again.
Why not just pool our assets?
We're always together as it is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no.
Fair is fair.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're not planning on keeping that,
are you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about?
He gave it to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but he's a child.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is a ring for royalty,
and you should know better.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, maybe I don't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I can only hope
one day you will.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There we go.
Perfectly balanced,
my friend. Here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Perfectly balanced?
- Oh, yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Both sides are the same?
- Exactly even.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good. Then you won't mind
if I take this side.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a second there, fella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What happened
to pooling our assets?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Will you give
the prince back his ring?
- Well, what's the hurry?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's not going anywhere.
Sheesh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
Oh, this can't be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But last night he was
in his bed, and he-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Have you searched the grounds? And?
- Every inch. Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He's gone.
- Oh, imbecile.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wha- Oh, good heavens.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A clue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We must inform the peasants.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Good people of Moscow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The prince has been kidnapped.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But I know who has stolen our czar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For she left this iron tooth behind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baba Yaga!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Baba Yaga!
- Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Baba Yaga.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone help us?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Think, good people, think.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who- Who can rescue our prince
from the evil Baba Yaga?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know someone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Zozi,
will you take it easy up there?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aargh!
Avast there, me pint-sized matey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Man the helm.
Batten down the hatches.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rough seas ahead.
There's a storm a-comin'.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Heave ho!
Hard a-starboard!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All hands, clear the deck.
Splice the mainsail.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enemies on the horizon.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What, somebody's comin' ?
- Aargh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spy with my- my little eye...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cossacks. Cossacks!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cossacks! I knew you shouldn't
have kept that ring!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quick, hide. If they see you're
not dead, we will be. Hurry!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hurry. Hide.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Halt!
- All righty. Halting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you Bartok the Magnificent?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, no. No, I'm not.
Never have been.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Although I hear he is quite gifted.
A real talent.
- Silence!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, I'lljust be quiet then.
That's no problem for me to be quiet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'lljust shush it right down.
- What is that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh- Ooh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's Bertok.
Bertok the Magnificent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's really quite different. I take
my show in a whole nother direction.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are coming with us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no, fellas, I really-
I have a thing-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, then, that'll be fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Your Royal Impressiveness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen, if this is about the ring,
just take it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bow before the Regent. Bow!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, there. Bowing, bowing. Don't have
to tell me twice. I love a good bow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Bartok the Magnificent,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we're so glad you came.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Please, l- You are?
- Hmm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Our young czar has been taken
by the evil witch Baba Yaga.
- Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our people and the royal family
have called on you to save him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah-huh.
- Don't even think-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go to the Iron Forest...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and return with our czar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, good people
of the fair city of Moscow,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it would give me no greater pleasure
than to risk my life...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so that I might bring back
your fabulous prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I mean that. I wouldn't just say that.
He's really something special.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately,
my schedule is extremely tight.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see.
I've got a Hydra in St. Petersburg.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I gotta be in the Ukraine on the th.
I can't get outta that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I could squeeze it in
when I get back from Minsk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I assure you,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you will be handsomely rewarded.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, no, really, l-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Well, perhaps I could push
the Hydra to June.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l- l- I mean no.
I really- I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hydra, terrible, eight heads,
flailing about, eatin' people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's- It's not pretty.
But thank you. Thank you very much.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Bartok?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, boy, here comes trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, please, magnificent Bartok,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
save my czar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um, well, you see,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
it's- it's complicated, but-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-but, um,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l-
- Please.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah, I'll do it.
- Oh, no.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, come on, huh?
How often do you get to rescue a czar ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yea, Bartok!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Or eaten by a witch?
- Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, thanks for the send-off, fellas.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll... take it from here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zozi, how's it going in there?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, listen,
I'll let you out in a second,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but first I just wanna let you know...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what a very special friend
I think you are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're warm, you're affectionate,
you're supportive,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
honest, thrifty, clean, reverent-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're furious.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're upset with me, aren't you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're peeved, you're miffed.
You can say it. Go ahead.
You're fuming. You're incensed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Bartok-
- Hang on. I'm not finished.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You're irate. You're beside yourself.
- Bartok-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I mean, literally,
you're here and yet you're here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You see, the- You get it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because you're here and yet-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, they all can't be gems,
all right? I'm done.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe we should do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was the little girl.
She killed me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear the lilt in her voice?
Nobody could resist that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'm sorry. What did you say?
- We should do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- We should?
- Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Now, there's no denying
it will be difficult.
- Right, exactly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Even dangerous.
- Dangerous?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, then that's it. We're
definitely going to St. Petersburg.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok, these people asked you
to help them for a reason.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because they saw
something in you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it so hard for you
to see it in yourself?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody needs you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that's how it starts
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone believes you'll come through
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're scared
So what
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet you've got
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A possible hero in you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's more than courage
or just being strong
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those things are easy to do
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have faith
Take heart
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's kind, he's smart
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That possible hero in you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Close your eyes
- I think I see it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're unafraid
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It just might be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can almost predict
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No more tricks, no more false pretenses
from the back of a wagon.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll save a life someday.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or slay a dragon
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Somebody needs you
- What else can you do
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But take your chances and see
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're on our way
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- All right?
- Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A possible hero
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Impossible hero
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A possible hero
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- In you
- In me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gee, who does her landscaping?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, it's official.
I'm frightened.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, there's your witch's hut.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gee, looky here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm terribly sorry.
Did I startle you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yah, yah.
You could say that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mmm.
Now, why have you come here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l-I've come for Prince Ivan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Delightful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And how might I help you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you just let him in here
to talk to that evil witch Baba Yaga.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He'll handle the rest.
- And you're certain
you're up to the task?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever heard
of Bartok the Magnificent?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, should I have?
- Mm-hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Do you like riddles?
- Riddles?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Riddles?
- Could you answer one?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I do, will you let me in?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Let me see.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Ready?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a section of fence
is feet long and feet wide...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and the parallel section
is the same length,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but both perpendicular sections
are twice as long-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Carry the six, plus the two-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is the key
that will open the witch's door ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry. I lost you there.
What was that last part?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is the key
that will open the witch's door ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I thought it was an arithmetic thing.
- A skeleton key.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly
what I was just gonna say.
A skeleton key.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zozi, you jumped the gun on me there.
Come on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ooooh!
- Hey!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mmm-mm-mm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you hear me say...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you could go in?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You go on ahead.
I'll wait for you here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But-
- Apparently, I'm not permitted.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as much as it might pain me
to not be with you
at this criticaljuncture in your life,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I accept it, fully aware,
as you should be,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that I am with you in spirit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- In spirit, huh?
- Always.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends, once more.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or close the wall up
with our English dead in peace."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for mentioning the dead, really.
That's real helpful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa-oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, would you look at that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Ivan?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody home?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is in my house?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I smell a rat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A witch's life
is very solitary
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one around
to talk to but trees
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So many years
of never makin' merry
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I can feel
a change in the breeze
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'Cause tonight there's
no one in the hallway
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one left or right
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But my hallways all say
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in my house tonight
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one by my fire
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one sippin' tea
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My fire's burnin'higher
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in my house with me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Witches are people
with a magic intuition
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And she's havin'a feelin'
that is, oh, so bewitchin'
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Even though no one's hangin'
round in the kitchen
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We knowthat someone is near, dear
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one in the attic
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one in my chair
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm so emphatic
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in my house
somewhere
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Where is he, where is he
- Where are you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wouldn't desert me
You know it would hurt me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Where is he, where is he
- Where are you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Little no one
you're through, ooh
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one in the mirror
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one by the door
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm gettin' nearer
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in my house for sure
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one small and dumb, no
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one pink and white, hey
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one
here I come, 'cause
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in my house
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone's in her house
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And no one's
gettin' out tonight
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah!
- Whoo!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that was...
convenient for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Quiet!
- Okay, sure, whatever you say.
Not another peep.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You broke into my home.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, actually,
your big head out there by the gate,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he gave me a key.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you just hang on to that.
That's fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shh!
Ah, you've come for the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah, mm-hmm.
- But why have they sent you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Filthy little creature.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not quite a rat, not quite a bird.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You certainly are not
a worthy adversary for me,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the evil Baba Yaga!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well,
appearances can be deceiving.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I think.
- Yes, they can.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know where the prince is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, what a shocker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I'll stop. I'll stop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, in order for me
to show you where he is,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you must first prove
that you are worthy of saving him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, listen, I'm extremely worthy.
They don't come more worthy than-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, sorry. Can't help it.
You go ahead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, sorry. Can't help it.
You go ahead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are three things
I seek within my forest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will tell you
where to find them...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and you must bring them to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quick question. Totally hypothetical,
of course. What if I can't?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can or you can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if you can't,
you will die not a hero,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and Moscow will never
see its prince again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a real win-win.
When do I start?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You already have.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I have?
- Head south to the ice quarry...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and bring Piloff to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Bring Piloff. That's it?
Bring Piloff to you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nah, it's just I thought
you were gonna say more.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, how am I gonna know this Piloff?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aach! Go. And tell your furry friend
if he helps you in any way,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you'll both die.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now, that I really
should be writing down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
" Both die."
It's the little things.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa! Okay, well,
I guess I'm gonna go now!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll catch ya later!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's actually rather charming
for an oversized skull,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
once you get past
his inquisitive nature.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Gosh, I feel like we've
been walking for hours here.
- We have.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-I have absolutely no idea where we are.
-Mm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not unlike Oedipus,
blinded with his mother's broach.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Left to wander the earth,
never knowing-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Zozi.
- I'm doing it again. I'll stop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it getting cold?
I must say, it is rather exciting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first of three gifts
you must search out and bring to her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Uh-huh.
- And I can't help in any way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's what she said.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am freezing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why is it getting so cold?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, hello there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bingo. Piloff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aha.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never get visitors.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is- You know what this is?
It's a pleasure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It's an absolute pleasure.
- You must be Piloff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you must be lost.
How delightful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's it? A little hike,
some cold weather...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
then bring this little thing
back to the witch?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is gonna be a piece of cake!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Oh, my goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hey there. I'm Bartok.
- Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about this, my little friend,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but I gotta bring you
back to Baba Yaga.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, dear. This isn't good.
You see, I'm stuck.
- Ah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ow!
- It's unbearable.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't even know how long
I've been here. What year is this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, boy.
- How's it going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not going good!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, that tickles.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pull, pull, pull.
Yes! Yes!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pulllllll!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's enough to drive you crazy,
isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh- Oh, boy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the sound of it,
you're making great progress.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, that was close.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, I felt like
we almost had something there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My goodness, you are determined.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This whole thing is very exciting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Okeydokey.
- Artichokey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend, we're going to Baba Yaga's,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with or without the extra baggage.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Such fun.
I'm having entirely too much fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, well, that makes one of us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wa-ha!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wheeeeeee!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi-ya!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, careful, careful.
- Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Wheeeeee!
- Intriguing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok, I've landed and I'm unharmed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you still on the boulder ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Um, yes!
- Whoop-de-do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What a strong little bat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're actually doing quite well.
I'm very impressed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one of those days
you never forget,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
when everything you wanted to happen
happens, only better.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm beside myself.
You know what, Bartok?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should try
and remember this too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I'll make a mental note.
All right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wheeeeeeee!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, talk about fun.
We did it, Bartok.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That was a blast.
Wheeeeeeeee!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Can you believe this, Bartok?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We dragged this big old boulder
all the way across the forest,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and I pop off ten feet
from the house.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That's funny.
- Yeah, that's hysterical.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah!
- And where, pray tell,
do you think you're going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- In to see Baba Yaga.
- Do you have a key?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, she took it. Ah, come on.
You're kidding, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me me me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No matter how hard you hit me,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
no matter how much I hurt,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm always good for a laugh.
What am I ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. A funny bone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Funny bone. Ha ha. Key, please.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much obliged.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're really quite good
at solving riddles.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I say, have you heard this one?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What starts off
in the morning on four legs?
-Ah,you brought me Piloff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Baba. I was stuck to a rock.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, boy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Ow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, uh, uh.
Don't sit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm tired.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I'm not sitting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, I'm not sitting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
go fetch me the crown
of Oble the metalworker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oble? He sounds big.
Is he big?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enormous.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He's much bigger than you.
- Piloff!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Sorry.
- Go!
- But I'm exhausted.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or if you don't,
Prince Ivan will be doomed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Which way?
- Walk east until it's dark.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then look for a fire in the forest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's it, huh?
Walk east and look for fire.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No "thank you" ?
No "nice work" ? Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, one last thing.
Give me the key.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but why?
I solved the riddle twice already.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give it to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Okay, that's yours.
Go ahead and take that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh, helping people
sure can take it out of ya.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good people of Moscow,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the prince has been taken from us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
God willing he will be returned.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But in the meantime,
the affairs of state must continue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l, as Regent,
will do my best...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to carry on and ensure the safety of...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and respect for...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the throne... of Russia.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is ridiculous. I'm out here
working my wings off, and for what?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I tell ya, if I get back
and she dumps this crown into her stew,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm gonna have a cow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Meanwhile, I ain't seen
hide nor hair of that prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, would ya look at that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He is large.
There's no denying it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But perhaps he's friendly.
- You think?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's try, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'lljust- I'lljust shout to him
and ask him if I can borrow his hat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll drop Baba Yaga's name. Maybe
they're friends. What could it hurt?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hello, good sir!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, very good.
Uh, we come bearing gifts, sir.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, well, not real gifts,
but gifts of warmth and affection.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In exchange for which we'd just love to
bring your headdress back to Baba Yaga.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aaba Raaba.
Pee wan foof poo mee nana.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What did he say?
- I just don't have a clue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Diction, my dear boy. It can make
all the difference in the world.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Carry on, Bartok.
- Oh! Ah! Hot! Oh, that's hot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It's hot. It's hot.
- Manna ooo boorin eeeeear?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you and me both,
my friend, I'm sure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just need to get that crown of yours
and we'll be on our way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oopsie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, ah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Okay. Hmm. How about this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, how about- Hey, it's hot.
Hey, hey, hey, hey-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hot, hot, hot.
- Yaya. Boogaler?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Part of the show. Totally planned.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay with me now,
'cause here comes the good stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Abraca-woozi!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eeyyy, boogaler.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Bravo!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Zozi, let's roll.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok, he's still coming.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you look at you?
You did it! You did it!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He's something special.
- Quiet, Piloff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And she drops it in the soup.
Perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is the most
difficult task of all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hold the onions.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's to go, please.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ay-yi-yi!
Yaah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, what's with the ruckus
first thing in the morning?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What happened to a nudge? What happened
to the smell of a nice cup of coffee?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Using only this crown...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and the boulder from the quarry,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
pluck the magic feather from the sky.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let me stop you here
for just one sec.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'Cause it's early,
I haven't eaten in about two days...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and I'm a little agitated.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But what does this have
to do with the prince?
- Everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
'Cause from where I'm standing,
I'm just running errands
for your little broth there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I am so sorry.
How insensitive of me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you still tired?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honestly?
Yes. Yes, I am.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh, oh.
Are you awake now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes. You were saying
something about a feather ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A magic feather.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It floats high in the air,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in the middle of a clearing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One feather comin' at ya.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-Ah, one last thing.
- What's that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You cannot fly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh! Ow!
- You can't fly?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nope. Hmm. Ow!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do I do this?
Help me here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I can't.
- Hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if I just try- Careful now.
I just wanna-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Ay, hot!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm exhausted.
I haven't eaten in days.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't the life for me.
Just forget it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A possible hero in you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I tried.
I did the best I can do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can get along without Moscow, and
I won't let that crazy witch find me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah, well, thank goodness.
- Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you can just imagine
if you had completed this task,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
everywhere we went
people would know who we are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'd spend the rest of our lives
running around having to help people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The incessant grabbing
and touching of admirers.
It's more than one can bear.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It certainly is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now we can run away, hide from
Baba Yaga for a couple of years.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which is fine by me.
I'm behind on my hibernating anyway.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then take the show back on the road,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and you can go on pretending
to be what you always wanted to be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, this is absurd.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How are you supposed
to get feet in the air...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with a large crown and a boulder?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You just can't do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, no, I can't, especially now
that it's all in pieces like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's, um, in pieces. Aha.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But of course.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi-ya! Tah-dah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now we get the prince!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When is a door not a door ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When it's a jar.
Child's play.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Now, open wide. I'm coming through.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ha ha. I did it. There you go.
Three for three.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You didn't think I had it in me,
did ya?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, hand over the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have given me the three things
I needed from the forest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But before I show you
where the prince is,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I need something from you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But how can I know what that is
if you never told me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a beauty or what?
They don't make 'em like this anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, that's not it.
- Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, okay, here it is,
the mother lode.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
An autographed portrait
of Ivan the Terrible.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l, uh- I caught him in a good mood.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, that's not it.
- No, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, how about-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It's something from here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Huh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Here. Here you go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hey, what's so funny? Hey, stop it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you stop laughing
at other people's misery?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Uh-oh.
- You never told me
I had to give you something.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're a cheat and a liar, you babbling
old woman with your iron teeth...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and your hocus-pocus.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It's no wonder everybody hates you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Bartok?
- Yeah? What do you want?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Good-bye.
- Oh, yeah, sure. Good-bye.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um, what are you doing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm just being a silly old woman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mean what I said.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look, nobody hates you, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just- l- ah- oh-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could give you what you need.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You just did.
- Huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most important ingredient,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
from your heart.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And now he is worthy
and so he shall see. Come.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come. Hurry up, you little rat bird.
I don't have all day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, whoa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tower.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh, you never took him, did ya?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I never said I did.
- You never took any children.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- People will believe what they will.
- But-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm happy to live alone in the woods
and not be bothered.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There. Take this.
You may need it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What is it?
- A magic potion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This will allow you
to be your innermost self.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you drink it,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
whatever you are
in your heart of hearts,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you will become on the outside tenfold.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute. You mean, the whole time
I was doing all that stuff for me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mm-hmm.
Now, leave me and save the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um, could l-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um, how about a- a hug?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- A hug?
- Come on. Bring it in.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A hug?
Don't push your luck, Bartok.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- All right, all right, all right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'm outta here. Color me gone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, and now all we have to do is tell
'em that the prince is in the tower...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and, boom,
we're on to St. Petersburg.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Uh, what are you doing?
- Finding an appropriate character.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zozi, I hate to break this to you, but
you can't go. They think you're dead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is exactly why a rich
and multi-layered character is crucial.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The right wardrobe,
a dab of well-placed grease paint,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and none will be the wiser.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Um, Zozi, just let me go tell 'em
where the prince is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if something goes wrong?
We still don't know who took the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but- What is this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Cabbage.
- Cabbage?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's your character ?
Cabbage?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great. You're gonna
blend right in with the crowd.
A big six-foot-tall cabbage guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but what could be more apropos...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
than Simka, the Russian peasant woman?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'm going, okay? You wait here.
- But-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah! Ouch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, brave bat,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you have returned
from your difficult journey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Healthy, alive,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
apparently no worse for the wear.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our congratulations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But where is the prince?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The prince never left the city.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Never left? I don't understand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, it's a little complicated
and fairly long-winded,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so everybody listen up, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I left here,
a little fanfare, down into the forest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of trees there,
some gargoyles, big, big skull.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Solved a riddle, met Baba Yaga.
Not a looker, folks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did three tasks.
Not important what they are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Suffice to say, at this point,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm fairly confident of my physical,
emotional and intellectual prowess.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But the prince.
- Hold on to your britches.
I'm getting there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me and the witch, we have a slight
disagreement. Some fisticuffs ensue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I come out on top,
and she slips me this here potion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-See?
- A potion? For what?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be all that I can be,
basically.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since I did all the tasks,
I'm now worthy of saving the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It- It makes you tenfold on the outside
what you are on the inside.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's my understanding anyway.
Eh, eh, eh. Look, but don't touch,
fella, all right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sounds impressive, I know.
Let me break it down for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Essentially, if I ever need to be
more powerful than l- I already am,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just give this here sucker
the old heave-ho.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but where is the prince?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Ivan is in the tower.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- The tower. The tower.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tall building, just outside
and to the right. You can't miss it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My goodness. Well, we-
we must go to the tower at once.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I warn you, if the prince
is not where you say he is...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and this has all been part
of some elaborate performance,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I assure you,
Bartok the Magnificent,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the city of Moscow will have your head.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tah-dah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What'd I tell ya?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hi, Ivan.
- Bartok?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My prince!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whew! I got worried there for a sec
while we were climbing the stairs there,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind telling ya.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You with the talk about taking my head
and everything. Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I still might.
- Hey, hey!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You imbecile!
What is that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That- That's a prince?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very good, yes.
Why didn't you do what I said?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did. I dressed up like the witch,
left that tooth and took the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And what about him?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But you told me
you wanted him out of the way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, what's he doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I put him in that cage
in the tippy-top of the tower.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How much more
out of the way could he be?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dead, you imbecile!
Dead is what he could be. Dead!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dead? But he's the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah, may I interject something here?
- No, you may not.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Okay.
- I never thought
I'd have to see you again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stupid little bat.
It was all so perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eliminate the prince, frame Baba Yaga,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
send a hapless entertainer to save him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And yet, here you are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The conquering hero, returning
from battle with all the answers!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, all the better.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Vol ? Get the prince.
- Yes?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Your Regency.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You three are the only ones who know.
- Hey!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And none of you will ever
leave this room-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
alive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll take that.
Do svidanya.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Poor Bartok the Magnificent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's come so far and done so much
for the good people of Russia.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Such a shame
he'll be remembered as a liar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ten times more powerful
than I already am.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tenfold on the outside
what I am on the inside.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, no, no!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, not to worry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The water will be along shortly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm off to claim my throne.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mmm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
they are going to welcome a new girl
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
no more lying or sneaking about
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll see
someone lovely as a flower
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone who is totally in power
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
when the real Ludmilla comes out
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
every rule's guaranteed to be broken
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Broken
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
every whisper turns into a shout
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feel all my inhibitions molting
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More than just the peasants
are revolting
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
when the real Ludmilla comes out
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
is the grand transformation
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hide, run away or go on a vacation
- Ah
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Starting today she'll be ruling
the nation, no doubt.
- Ah
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And starting today the whole world
will be mine on a platter
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Every man on a plate
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kneel, you peasant, you peon
you dim-witted lout
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gee, the future looks great
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now my inner beauty is appearing
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can almost hear
the peasants cheering
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
when the real Ludmilla
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Proves she's a ruler
to rival Attila
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting today
when the real Ludmilla
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Comes out
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- People of Moscow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My people!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my goodness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Vol, the water's rising. Hurry.
Bartok, help. Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Psst! Bartok.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Come on.
- Whoa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Huh? Zozi ?
- Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What happened?
- Oh, you know, not much.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, Prince Ivan and his guard
are about to drown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm next, 'cause I can't
get out of the cage.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ludmilla drank Baba's potion
and is about to take over the kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, though,
everything is, you know, hunky-dory.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've got an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get us up!
Don't leave us here!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Zozi ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe I've separated my shoulder.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hey, help us down here!
- Hurry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One more time oughta do it.Just give it
a little more, you know, oomph.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, that's what I've been doing wrong.
I've been lacking...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
oomph!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you. You mentioned
something about having an idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was- Was this what you came up with?
You can be honest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I may have made a slight miscalculation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm slipping.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry, Your Highness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ah, Zozi ?
- Uh-oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Tah-dah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm reminded of Euripides'
character Hippolytus...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
whose own life hung in the balance.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wronged by Aphrodite.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dying, nobly,
in his forgiveness of Theseu-
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You've gotta stop Ludmilla.
Go on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- The potion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not so fast.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, you got yourself
one hard head there, really.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"At night the sea began
to rise in waves of death.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Ship against ship...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the Thracian storm wind shattered us."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, you are very good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
First time I performed that was in '
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
at the Siberian Greek Tragedy Festival.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Do more.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right,
that's enough already with the fire.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fire! Fire!
The town's on fire!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We need water, lots of water.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is gonna stop her.
It's time for the "boogaler."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's good, no?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In addition,
you gotta realize that these are all
a different size and weight.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That increases the level
of difficulty exponentially.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Step right this way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"The man who is well-minded
to the state...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"from me in death and life...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
shall have his honor."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, that's completely unnecessary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here, dragon lady!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Zozi.
- Bartok.
- We're over here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Aha!
- Hey, where's the water ?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Hurry!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, good for you.
You got it. Congrats.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hey, hot, hot, hot!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, so close on that one.
Listen, I've been right where you are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a whole thing
with a magic feather.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, oh!
It's frustrating, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's right there,
but you can't get at it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's, uh- It's not fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Much better there.
Just up a little bit and to the left.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice trip.
See you next fall.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bartok, where's the water?
Aah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shee.
Talk about your big finish.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They can't write stuff like this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well done, my friend. Well done.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Well, right back at ya, my friend.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Some wicked witch.
- Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was those tasks that helped you
become what you always wanted to be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- And I never gave her anything.
- What do you mean?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You gave her what she needed most
and what only a true hero could.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your compassion, Bartok.
You gave her your compassion.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I did, didn't I ?
She got upset, and l- I helped her out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boom! I just gave her my compassion.
Didn't even think about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hah. Well, when you got it,
you got it, I guess, Zozi.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you what.
I'm one heck of a guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You certainly are.
For a bat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Citizens of Moscow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please stand with me and give thanks
to Bartok the Magnificent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He saved us
and we are forever in his debt
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please, it's embarrassing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Psst!
- Ooh, I almost forgot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here you go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But that was my gift to you.
- Nonsense, Your Highness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you
something about that ring.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That ring is a ring for royalty.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- How's tricks?
- How's tricks?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think he did really, really well,
don't you, Baba?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Piloff, shh, shh, shh.
Congratulations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you... for everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, well...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hang on a sec. Is it me or is there
a lot of love up here right now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what? I think it's time
for that hug I was talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Again with the hug?
- Come on, Piloff. Group hug.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Stop it now. Go, go, go.
- Bring it in, everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh, I love hugs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, enough.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I'll be seeing ya.
- You can count on it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- See you soon! Auf wiedersehen!
- Piloff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bye, Bartok!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
