Theodore!
What? Dave always turns off the light after saying good night.
That fire was sort of the only thing keeping us from freezing to death.
Yeah! Can't you just relight it?
How? With your glasses. And the sun?
All right! Way to keep the spirits up, guys.
Doing it, yeah!
And what is this supposed to be? Breakfast!
No, it's bark.
Yeah, for breakfast!
I bet it's very good.
It's not.
It's been forever since our last all-you-can-eat buffet.
Crazy suggestion, guys, Iet's get off this beach and let's find some real food.
If I know my horticulture, and I do, this is a grove of mango trees.
Then where are all the mangoes?
Theodore: Maybe the Jungle Monster 4 ate them all!
You were planning on sharing that, right?
Of course.
Well, good.
'Cause it kind of looked like you were gonna eat it all by yourself.
What? I would never do that.
I don't believe you.
Hey!
Yeah! Winning!
What?
I'll make sure to save you the pit!
My acorns!
Way to go, Theodore! Come on, we'II split it.
Don't listen to him, Theo.
He's gonna eat it all by himself.
I'll share it with you.
No. She's trying to trick you.
No, you're trying to trick him.
No, you're trying to trick him by saying I'm trying to trick him.
He's lying, Theo!
What?
Theodore, I am so sorry!
Oh, no!
My precious! My precious!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Look at us.
One day on this island and we've become animals!
Did you hear that?
What was that? Jungle Monster.
Positions, everybody.
Hold.
Hold.
Fire!
No! Why?
Please don't eat us, Mr. Jungle Monster!
I'm not a monster, I'm Zoe. And I'm clearly a girl who has been on this island for so long that now she's imagining that squirrels can talk.
We are chipmunks.
Yeah, Alvin and the Chipmunks.
Who and the what now?
I'm sure you've heard of the Chipettes. We're kind of world famous.
Who?
Maybe this will help.
Okay. Stop. Lame!
I don't know who you are.
Awkward!
Exactly how long have you been here?
Well, I got here on a Monday, so...
Yeah, like, you know, eight or nine years?
Nine years? Wait. You've been here nine years?
Well, it could be eight.
What if we're here nine years?
What if we're here forever?
I told you, Dave's coming.
I used to think that Dave was coming, too.
And he never did.
Dave Henderson, my supervisor at UPS.
I used to fly cargo planes for them, until one day I crash-landed in the ocean.
We crash-landed, too. Really?
But our Dave won't rest until he finds us.
Right, Alvin?
Absolutely.
You mean I'm finally gonna get out of here?
I can't wait to go tell the others!
There are others?
I mean, can you guys imagine being stuck here for all these years without anybody to talk to?
I think I'd lose my mind!
Chipmunks, I'm pleased to introduce my friends.
This is Rawlings, Spalding, Callaway, Dunlop, and, right there, that's Nerf.
Hey, girlfriend, you look good.
They survived the crash with me.
Okay.
Hi. Hi.
Hello. Okay.
I'm Theodore.
Guys, Dave is coming to get us!
No, not Dave Henderson. I saw your face!
It's another Dave.
But, you guys, just get excited. We're finally gonna get off this island.
She's funny.
In a crazy sort of way.
This totally calls for a party. Who's hungry?
Yeah! Yes, please!
I'm hungry. We are famished.
Yeah? Let's go to my place.
Is it far? I don't think I could walk another step.
Who said anything about walking?
We're gonna die!
Oh, man! That was so cool!
I know, I know!
Come on. Come on in, guys! Bring it in.
Come on down!
Yeah! Wasn't that awesome?
No, it was not awesome. It's a miracle we got here safely. In fact, the odds of a chipmunk getting hurt on a zip-line are one out of six.
Eleanor: Aaaah!
Simon: [sighs[ Why do I always have to be right?
Ellie, Ellie! Are you okay?
Aleanor: I think I sprained my ankle!
You know what, you should put some ice on that.
No, guys, I don't have any ice. I live there in that tree.
I thought that maybe you did, though.
No, we don't have any ice. Just like we don't have any shelter.
Wow, that's a major bummer for you.
Do you guys like bungee jumping? 
Yes!
No. We do not. Listen, lady, maybe you should just leave us alone so we can focus more on surviving and less on k*lling ourselves.
Whoa, that is a lot of uptight in a very little package.
I'm not uptight. I just don't wanna see anyone else getting hurt. Ow! Criminy. What was that?
You know what, that was just a spider and they live here because this is nature.
It is not just a spider, it's a Phoneutria bahiensis. Its bite contains a neurotoxin.
Mr. Fancy Words. So what?
Simon: Alvin, toxin? Poison? Neuro? Brain?
That's not good.
Side effects include changes in personality, Ioss of inhibition, dry mouth.
Zoe: Okay, calm down. I get bitten probably twice a day by these little fellows and I am still completely normal.
Alvin: Yes, normal.
Simon: Oh, no.
Alvin? Simon!
Chubby one!
Girl chubby one!
Brittany? Jeanette?
I hope they're okay.
Who cares if they're okay? I just need them to be here.
And here I am thinking you've changed and don't only care about yourself.
Nope. And it's a good thing, too.
Because right now the rage I'm feeling for you and those chipmunks is the only thing keeping me going.
Shall we keep going?
Ian, just keep an eye out for something to eat or drink, all right?
All right. Right there!
Where? 
That thing around your neck.
You're not gonna eat this. This was a gift from Theodore.
That explains it. I was gonna say, it's really ugly. Like, really... Wow. Ugly.
Dave: It's not ugly. It goes with everything and it's soft enough to sleep in.
Yeah, and it's edible.
You will not eat my son's necklace.
He's not your son, Dave. He's just a chipmunk.
Dave. Where are you?
Where are you, Alvin?
Ian: All right. I'm gonna crash.
Simon. Where are you going?
Who is this Simon you speak of?
You?
No, my name is not Simon. It is Simone!
That's pretty close to Simon.
And yet completely different.
Would you care to join me on my adventure?
What adventure?
The adventure called life!
Okay.
But just until Dave shows up.
Alvin, Alvin! Simon and Theodore are gone.
They probably just went to get stuff for the shelter.
It's all the guy can talk about.
Still, it's not like them to wander off like that.
Could you please go look for them?
Why can't you?
I have a situation of my own to deal with, Alvin.
Right. How is Eleanor doing?
She's fine. I'm talking about me. It's been two days since my last bath and I am a mess. I can't get rescued looking like this.
Oy.
Theo! Simon! Simon!
Theodore! Theo!
Si! Theo!
Bonjour, my friend.
Simon? Are you bungee jumping?
His name is not Simon.
It is Simone.
That's pretty close to Simon.
Yeah, I thought so, too. But he's acting totally different.
The spider bite! That's it! Remember the side effects?
Personality changes, loss of inhibition?
Lies! Who are you?
Wow! Simone is pretty cool.
It's Simon, Theodore. And, no, he's not.
Au revoir, Alfred.
Alvin. It's Alvin!
C'est magnifique, Simone!
Okay, Theo, it's all you.
Really? I've never done anything like this.
And you never will.
How can you let him do this? What are you thinking?
I'm thinking, "When did my dad wash up on this island?"
What? We were having the best time.
Why do you have to show up and be so uptight?
Me? Uptight?
I'm not the uptight one, I'm the fun one!
The cool one. Ask anybody.
Who should I ask?
Come on. Theodore, you can't bungee jump.
You get scared just watching a movie.
Munk up, Alvin.
A little help?
Much better. Jeanette, these dresses are, like, totally adorbs. I die.
Thank you. And I also made these for you, Eleanor. 
Look how handy you are all of a sudden.
And in case you get tired, I made you a wheelchair.
Super.
Enchanté, mademoiselles. A kiss.
A kiss. And a...
A kiss.
What's gotten into him? Spider venom.
Yeah, yeah, he thinks he's some sort of fun-loving French dude.
Really? Now he thinks he's...
The most interesting munk in the world.
Simon? Simon.
Simone?
I think we should get to work on that shelter.
I cannot imagine a better roof over our heads than the stars in the sky.
What about the kind of roof over our head that's actually a roof?
It's going to rain!
What is a little rain?
We cherish the water, for it is the water that nurtures the flower.
Okay. This is crazy!
Building a shelter was your idea. Yours!
Great. Great!
All right, guys, we're gonna build a shelter.
I need everyone's help. Let's go.
I'll try. But I feel so useless.
What are you doing? What I've wanted to do since the moment I laid my eyes all over on you.
What?
Hey, you guys are going to catch pneumonia dancing in the rain like that.
You ought to be careful kicking mud around like that.
Hello?
Someone could lose an eye!
Eleanor: That looks like fun.
Eleanor? Would you care to dance? 
I'd love to.
With me? 
Yes, Theodore!
Brittney: I can't believe Jeanette's getting all the attention. I'm the pretty one. Jeanette's the smart one. You don't see me running around trying to be all smart, do you?
Alvin: I know! I'm the fun one, you're the pretty one. 
Brittney: Yeah!
Alvin: Do you know how slippery that dirt is? This is ridiculous. Are you even listening to me? Simon!
Brittney: Alvin? You're starting to sound like Dave.
No!
What are you doing?
Building a shelter.
Since I'm not the fun one anymore I figure I may as well be the responsible one.
Really?
Well, since I'm not the pretty one anymore, maybe I should build a shelter, too.
Yeah, good luck with that.
What, you don't think I could do it?
Hey, I didn't say that, Brit.
I thought it, but I didn't say it.
So you wanna play it this way.
He's so French.
Be careful, Simone!
Let's do it.
Oh, no.
Now, wasn't that a pleasant ride?
Good thing we don't wear pants.
Okay, you guys, come on, come over.
Are you sure it's safe? Of course it's safe.
I do this thing every day.
Jeanette! Jeanette!
Hold on, Jeanette.
No, no. Look into my eyes.
You have nothing to fear.
Yes, yes. Very good.
You are safe. Bravo!
You made it! You're so brave.
Pretty.
Double rainbow. What does it mean?
Alive they're superstars, sure. But d*ad? They're legends.
I'm talking about tribute albums, pay-per-view funerals.
Wait a second. You actually think I'm in this for the money?
Well, if you're doing it to pick up chicks, you're doing a lousy job.
I'm doing this because I love them, okay?
Look, if you wanna spend the rest of your life running around after a bunch of spoiled brats, be my guest.
They're not brats. Really? Even Alvin?
You never even bothered to get to know them, Ian. I mean, sure, Alvin can be kind of a handful, but he means well. He's sometimes just a little irresponsible, that's all. But, come on, Simon? He's probably the most level-headed kid I know. If anything, he's a little too uptight. And then there's little Theodore.
Ian: Dave, I barely cared about what you had to say about the first two. I can't imagine the big-boned one is gonna be any more interesting.
Dave: Forget it, let's just keep going.
Up, poisson, up!
Oh, no. This is terrible.
Shouldn't he have come up by now?
Uh oh.
Jeanette: Simone! Where are you? Zoe, you've gotta do something.
All right. Callaway, I need you to go in there and find Simone. I know you can do it, little buddy.
You're kidding, right?
If Callaway can't find him, nobody can.
Simone!
Told you.
Simone: I'm sorry if I caused you any worry, mademoiselle. But I have something for you. Maybe this will be a way to make it up.
Jeanette" It's beautiful! Where did you find it?
Zoe: Yeah, it is beautiful. Where did you find it?
Simone: In a cave behind the waterfall. I thought it would look nice on you. But now I realize even the most precious gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Zoe: Yeah. Were there any other jewels or gems or diamonds or anything else in there?
Simone: By the time I found the gold, I had already been gone from my Jeanette far too long.
Theodore: What?
You guys, they found it. They found it!
And the best part is, they don't even know what they found.
They think that it's just one bracelet.
Which means that the rest of the treasure is mine.
All mine!
What the...
What are you?
Hey!
Yeah, you're one of those honey badgers.
You just take what you want.
Drop it. Drop it!
You mess with me, ése, I'll go loco on you.
Hey!
Give it back!
You can sting like a bee or strike like a cobra, but this honey munk don't care!
Alvin: Okay, Brit, I'm all done. If you want, I can help you get started... This tree house is awesome. Maybe you are kind of the smart one.
Thank you, Alvin. And yours is... Well, you did your best.
Anyhoo, no reason we can't be comfortable and stylish while we wait for Dave to show up, right?
Brit, I...
I think I know why Dave hasn't come.
You do? Why?
'Cause he's not even looking.
Alvin, why wouldn't he be looking for us?
Because I drive him crazy.
You know, the way Simon's been driving me crazy?
I mean, that's what I've been doing to Dave.
For years.
No wonder he hates me.
Don't worry, Alvin. I'm sure Dave will come. I mean, he certainly loves Simon and Theodore.
Theodore: Simon? Is Dave ever gonna find us? Simon? I mean, Simone?
Simone: I'm so sorry, were you speaking to moi?
Theodore: Yes! About Dave! Are we ever going to find him?
Simone: I see you are sad, mon ami. And I hate to see you sad. I will help you find your friend Dave.
Theodore: You really think you can find him?
Simone: I know I can! And then I will find this Simon you keep speaking of!
Simone: As Dave and I have never met, I will need you to describe him for me.
Theocore: Well, he's very kind and a good storyteller.
Simone: Very helpful.
Theodore: And he's about this tall.
Simone: Is he by any chance a big, flightless bird?
Theodore: I don't think so.
Simone: Then these footprints must not be his.
Theodore: [gasps] Jungle Monster!
Do you hear that?
Yeah, it's my stomach grumbling.
No, no, maybe it's a helicopter! Listen!
Face it, Dave, no one is coming to rescue us, okay?
And my stomach noises are gonna get louder and louder and louder until one day they just stop.
Because I will have eaten you.
Maybe you're right. Maybe no one's coming.
Maybe the chipmunks aren't here at all. Maybe they're gone.
I really messed up.
Dave, it kills me to say this, kills me, but...
Look, man,
you're really good with those kids, really good.
They love you.
And I should know because I was really bad with those kids and they hate me.
But, look, you should know that whatever happens, you did nothing wrong. Nothing.
Thanks, Ian.
Come here.
Yeah. Yeah.
Ian?
Ian?
Ian!
Theodore: The Jungle Monster's real! And it's angry!
Simone: Or hungry. Allons-y! That means let's go.
Alvin: Great, a volcano.
Brittney: Of course! That's why the water was so hot! It's being heated by the underground magma chamber!
Jeanette: How do you know that? 
Brittney: I have no idea! The place where I get my nails done always has the Science Channel on. Maybe I accidentally paid attention.
Zoe: Hey, guys, anyone up for a quick hike? Like, I don't know, maybe to the waterfall or whatever?
Alvin: Not now, Zoe! The whole island is going to explode!
Zoe: What?
Alvin: Guys, we've got to get off this island. We have to build a raft, now.
"Right now" Iike, right now?
Or "right now" Iike, after a hike to the waterfall now?
Simone: I've been hit!
Theodore: By Dave's necklace?
Simone: Tell Jeanette I will watch over her with angel wings.
Theodore: Dave?
Dave: Theodore!
Simone: Dave? Told you we'd find him!
Dave: Simon!
Simone: It is Simone, but I am often confused for this Simon fellow. Perhaps we look alike?
Dave: Simone?
Theodore: Ian!
Ian: Hey, you found the chubby one.
Dave: Don't worry, Theodore. Nothing's gonna happen to you. Is it?
Theodore: What was that?
Ian: That's an active volcano.
Alvin: Okay, Brittany and I will build the deck. Eleanor, you need to start braiding ropes. Jeanette, find as many coconuts and mangoes as you can. Who knows how long we'II be out there.
Dave: What can I do to help?
Dave! Dave!
Dave!
You found us! Hey.
We missed you so much.
I knew you would find us.
Dave: Eleanor! What happened?
Eleanor: You know, just a zip-line accident.
Dave: A what?
Elaenor: I'm fine. It only hurts when I try to explain it.
Okay, you know what, never mind.
The important thing is you guys are safe.
Alvin? Everything's gonna be okay. Hey, what is it?
Alvin: I thought you'd never find us. That you weren't even looking.
Why wouldn't I look for you?
Alvin: Because I'm such a pain in the...
Dave: Alvin.
Alvin: I know, you don't think I'm a pain.
Dave: No, you're a pain. But I'd come, no matter what.
Simone: Arc de Triomphe, mayonnaise, Napoleon.
Ian: I get it, Frenchie, you come from a rich history. Well, guess what, we're all gonna be history if we don't get out of here.
Chipettes: Uncle Ian!
Alvin: What's he doing here?
Dave: It's kind of a long story.
Don't worry, he's cool.
Yes, for a pelican man.
Yeah, nothing cooler than a grown man in a pelican suit.
So, Dave, how are we gonna get out of here?
Dave: I don't know, Alvin, I think you've got this under control.
Alvin: Theodore, you and Eleanor are on rope duty. Dave and Ian, we need oars. Simone, you and Jeanette are in charge of food. And, Zoe...
Zoe: No, I know, I know. I'm gonna go and I'm gonna pack up my balls!
Dave: Who's that?
Alvin: Another long story.
Yeah! Good work, guys! Let's get off this island.
This raft won't build itself.
Go! Go! Go!
Heave! Ho!
Heave! Ho!
It's incredible, you guys.
Ian: Very impressive.
Dave: Just seeing everyone come together to build it, I just want to say... It can wait.
Wait, where are Jeanette and Simone?
I hope this is going to be enough.
Did you hear something?
Who can say? When I am with you, all I can hear is the b*ating of my own heart.
Oh, Simone!
Oh, no!
Somebody! Help!
Dave: Jeanette?
Alvin: Guys! Guys! Over here! Come quick, hurry!
Simone, are you okay? Simone!
Simon: Why are you calling me Simone?
Alvin: Simon? 
Yeah.
Alvin: Ha ha! You're back! It finally wore off!
Simon: What wore off?
Alvin: You were bitten by a spider. It, like, messed up your brain.
Simon: Is that why I think I see Dave and a half-Ian, half-bird?
Dave: No, it's really me. And really Ian.
Ian: 'Sup?
Allvin: Simon, where's Jeanette? She was out here with you.
Simon: Jeanette? I don't know...
Brittney: I do. It's Zoe. She took her. Simon, I need to know where you found that gold bracelet.
Simon: What gold bracelet?
Brittney: The one you gave to Jeanette.
Simon: What? When did I give Jeanette a bracelet?
Brittney: On your date.
Simon: Jeanette and I are dating?
Brittney: Okay, he's useless. Theodore, Eleanor, you're gonna have to lead the way.
Theodore: I don't remember exactly how to get there.
Eleanor: I do!
Dave: Which way, Eleanor?
Make a left. No, right. No, left!
I thought you said you knew where you were going.
Eleanor I do! Sometimes I just forget my left from my right. That way! Okay, we just have to cross here.
Simon: Are you kidding me? Guys, I can't do that.
But, Simon, you already did.
Simon: No, I didn't. That was Simone, that was not me.
Brittney: But Simone is you. He's in there somewhere. You just have to find him, tout de suite. Because Jeanette needs you, Simon.
Simon: No, I'm sorry, I just can't do it.
Dave: All right, Ian, get everyone to the raft. If the volcano blows before I make it out of here, you have to promise me you'II...
Ian: Leave without you. Got it.
Okay.
Alvin: Dave. I'm coming with you.
Dave" Absolutely not, it's too dangerous.
Alvin: Remember I said someday I may need to disobey you? Sorry, Dave, but I gotta disobey you.
Dave: Let's go.
You're not coming up until you have every last bit of that treasure.
But the volcano is about to explode!
Well, then I guess you better hurry, huh?
Run, go, go. In you go.
Get down there. That's right.
Keep going!
S.O.S.
Please someone help me It's not healthy for me to feel this Y.O.U. are Making it hard I can't help it See, it don't feel right Keep moving!
This time, please Someone come and rescue me
Okay! Pull me up. I can't hold any more.
If you can still talk, it means you haven't stuffed your cheeks yet!
Yes! That sounds very good.
Dave: Jeanette!
Alvin: Dave! They're supposed to be behind that waterfall!
That's right. That's what I'm talking about.
Alvin: Zoe! 
Zoe: No, no. Not another step. Don't come any closer.
Dave: Are you all right, Jeanette?
Jeanette: I'm pretty freaked out, and those earrings tasted awful.
Alvin: Zoe, you don't have to do this.
Zoe: I don't? I spent ten years looking for this treasure. It's the whole reason why I came to this stinking island!
Alvin: You mean you didn't crash-land?
Zoe: They said that I was crazy and they said that this map was a fake. And now the treasure is mine!
Alvin: Run!
Dave: Jeanette, come on, come on. Run!
No, you don't!
Jeanette!
Jeanette: Oh, no, help!
You're going back in that cave, and you are going to get me more treasure.
Simon: Jeanette!
Jeanette: Simone! 
Simon: It's Simon!
Alvin!
No!
Hurry! Come on, guys, go!
Go, go!
Come on, come on.
Look!
Come on!
Run!
But where's Dave?
Help me up! 
Help you up? Is that what I'm supposed to do now, Dave? All I had was my treasure, and now it's gone. Do you get that? My life is ruined. And now you're gonna know how that feels.
No, no!
It's tempting to blame Dave. I know. I've been there. I wish I could get back all those years I spent plotting my revenge. All that time and energy, wasted. All those pizzas I had delivered to his house, wasted. 
That was you?
Not now, Dave! All right?
You could let Dave fall to his death and I could go back to the raft with the chipmunks, become their manager again and make tons of money.
So, really, I'm good either way.
But let me tell you something.
Hate, anger, regret, those aren't just members of a girl group I once signed.
They're what consumed me. And they're consuming you.
It's not too late to do the right thing.
Or not. Again, I'm good either way, so...
I don't want to sway you.
Alvin: What are you guys doing? Help me. Please. Help me save my dad! Hurry! I got you, Dave. Come on! Help me, guys.
Wow!
There they are!
Come on!
Faster!
Hurry! Hurry!
Let's go, go, go!
Oh, no!
Get up! Hurry!
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Run!
Grab the oar!
Come on! Come on, guys!
Paddle!
Come on! Paddle!
Faster! Come on, hurry!
Now we'II never get to perform at the International Music Awards.
I guess now we're the losers.
Jeanette, I don't know what to say.
I guess I was just so obsessed with finding that treasure that I kind of... I lost it.
And I'm...
I'm really sorry.
We both are.
Well, apology accepted.
Here, I want you to have this.
Really?
Look, Dunlop, this is a new beginning for both of us.
I hope you don't mind.
Simone gave it to me.
I don't mind.
You know, Jeanette, even the most perfect gem cannot compare to your beauty.
Dave? Yes, Alvin?
I just wanted to say now that we're not all, you know, d*ad, sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry I was acting like a child on the ship.
And kind of maybe ruined our family vacation.
Sometimes a racehorse needs a little room to run.
Yes. Yeah. I like where your head's at.
That is very wise, David.
'Sup?
What, no love for Uncle Ian?
You put us in cages! You put us in cages!
Seriously? Are we still talking about that?
New subject, I saved Dave's life.
Okay, but I'll be watching you, mister.
Alvin, you still have that pocket Knife I gave you?
Knife? Right, sorry, I meant to give it back.
I want you to keep it.
Really?
Maybe you can use it to signal that helicopter.
What?
Hey! Down here!
Hello!
It's me, Ian Hawke! Jet Records!
Guys, circle around!
Everything's okay. We got you, guys!
It's good to be back, huh?
Sure is.
Sold Zoe's story to Hollywood. Huge bidding war. Keira Knightley is interested. I'm thinking Fiddy Cent for me.
Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you.
You're a great audience. We love you!
I'm sorry, sir, that's full.
We're gonna have to gate-check those.
Are you gonna charge me 25 bucks a bag?
Of course not, sir.
It's $25 for the first bag and $40 for each additional bag.
I'm a little chilly. Would you mind adjusting the vent?
But of course.
You wrinkled my business magazine. Sorry.
Guess I'll have to read this.
She's pretty.
Wait, that's me.
All right, head count.
You like my Jungle Monster costume? Eleanor made it for me.
Yeah! Out of a barf bag!
Nice.
Where's Alvin?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking.
We're cleared for an on-time departure for Timbuktu.
If Timbuktu is not for you, please alert the flight attendant by pressing your call button.
Alvin!
Thank you for choosing AirAlvin. Enjoy your flight!
Sir, please return to your seat, we're about to take off.
Sit. Now.
But he... Sit!
No, no, no!
Alvin!
