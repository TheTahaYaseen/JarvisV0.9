Buck: Oh, no, no, not the book. How many have seen "opening the book" before?
[<i>brakes screech</i>]
Buck: Close the book. We're not doing that. Here's what we're gonna do. Why don't I just go back to the day things took a turn for the worse?

Chicken Little: No, no, no! It's true! Come with me!
Buck: No. Son? What?
Chicken Little: It happened under the old oak tree! I'm not making this up. It's here. [stammering] There's a piece of the sky somewhere.....somewhere on the ground. It was shaped Iike that!
Dog: It Iooks Iike a stop sign?
Chicken Little: Yes! Only it doesn't say "stop" and it's blue and it has a cloud on it. And it hit me on the head! It Iooked Iike a stop sign.
Person: Wait What's that?
Buck: Son, is this what hit you?
Chicken Little: Oh, no, Dad. It was definitely a piece of the sky!
Buck: A piece of a sky. It's OK, everyone! There's been, Iike, a Iittle mistake. It was just an acorn that-that hit my son. A Iittle acorn that hit my son.
Chicken Little: No! Dad, no.
Buck: Quiet, son. This is embarrassing enough already.
Reporter 1: Chicken Little! What were you thinkin'?
Reporter 2: Why put your town's safety in jeopardy?
Reporter 3: How could you mistake a stop sign for an acorn?
Chicken Little: But it... a big acorn Ievel fluh.
Teporter Poodle: What did he say?
Chicken Little: A big acorn Ievel fluh...
[Reporter 2] It was a big acorn?

News: Ladies and gentlemen. it's just gibberish. Gibberish of an insane person.
Turkey Lurky: Come on, Buck! Your kid went and scared us all half to death!
Buck: Well, what can I tell you, folks, my son, you know... Kids do crazy stuff. You have kids. It's...
Chicken Little: No, Dad. It wasn't an acorn. It was... it was a piece of the sky. Really, it was. You gotta believe me.
Buck: [chuckling] A movie. A movie. They're makin' a movie. When? When will everybody forget your big mistake? First it was all over the papers, then they wrote a book about it, then the book on tape, then the board game, the spoons with your face on it... ...and the Web site, the commemorative plates. ...and the Web site, the commemorative plates.
- You saw them, right?
- Yeah. I saw them.
Can't eat off 'em.
- They're not microwave-safe.
- Billborads! You saw the billboards?
Chicken Little: I saw them.
Buck: Ha! There's a bumper sticker. I knew it was only a matter of time. Billboards I could Iive with. Posters I could even Iive with. But a bumper sticker. It's... it's Iike glued on forever.
Chicken Little: It doesn't matter. You know why? Because I've got a plan.
Buck: Yeah, about that. Well, remember how I told you it would be better for you to Iay Iow, don't call attention to yourself? Right?
Chicken Little: Yes, but I...
Buck: See, it's Iike a game. Yeah, a game of hide-and-seek, except the goal is never to be found, ever!
Chicken Little: [stammering]
Buck: Great! [chuckles] Now, we've got a plan, right? I'II see ya Iater! Remember, Iay Iow.

[cheering]
Runt: Oh, man.
Foxy: Pump it up! Pump it, pump it, pump it!
Split into two teams. Popular versus unpopular.
Runt: Coach?
Coach: Yeah, unpopular?
Runt: Shouldn't we review safety guidelines?
Coach: Sure! Hit the pig, kids!
Runt: Aaah! [screaming] Look out!
Abby: Calm down, Runt. Just... Just do what Fish is doing. Tough morning?
Chicken Litte: A run-in with my old nemesis.
Abby: Gum in the crosswalk?
Chicken Little: He won this round.
Abby: Your old foe!
Chicken Little: Mm-hmm.
Abby: Incoming on your right.
Chicken Little: Thank you!
Abby: Yeah, I heard about the movie. Tough break.
Chicken Little: Yeah.
Abby: Well, Hey! Maybe it'II just go straight to video.
Chicken Little: That's the Ieast of my problems. This morning... this morning my dad told me I should basically disappear. But that's not gonna get me down. Because I've got a plan. You want to hear about it?
Abby: Uh-oh.
Chicken Little: No, no, no no, no! This one's good. Look, one moment destroyed my Iife, right? One moment. Warthog at 3':00!
Abby: I see him Yes!
Chicken Little: So I figure all I need is a chance... AII I need is a chance to do something great to make everyone forget the "sky falling" thing once and for all. And then my dad'II finally have a reason to be proud of me.
Coach: Time out!
Morkubine: [snickering]
Coach: Nurse!
[dialing]
Woman: Hi, Tiffany!
Dog: Hey, man, what's goin' on?
Chicken Little: So, uh... what do you think?
Abby: OK, Iisten. You said the sky was falling. Your dad didn't support you.
Chicken Little: I...
Abby: And you have been hurting inside ever since, right? It's hurt. It stung. OK?
Chicken Little: It's hurt, but... Yes.
Abby: That's the nutshell.
Chicken Little: OK. Yes, but...
Abby: No. Buh-buh...
Chicken Little: But, it's...
Abby: Buh! What's got to happen now is the nut needs to be cracked open. And not one Iittle chip at a time, but... bam! Smash! Bits of emotion flying everywhere! Anger! Frustration! Denial! Fear! Deep depression, in fact! You see what I'm saying?
Runt: Uh...
Abby: AII right, forget the nut part. Here's the main thing. You have got to stop messing around, and deal with the problem.
Chicken Little: OK, yes, but...
Abby: Here's the real solution. You and your dad talk-talk-talking... closure!
Chicken Little: CIosure?
Abby: CIosure, talking about something until it's resolved. Wait! Hold on! See? Look. There's a whole section about it in this month's Modern Mallard. Incredibly appropriate!
Chicken Little: I told you, I have a plan.
Abby: Yeah, but according to Cosmo Duck, you should "stop the squawk and try the talk." Beautiful Duckling says, "Avoiding closure with your parents can cause early molting." See? CIosure.
- [sighing]
Abby: Come on! Just repeat after me. You, your dad, talk-talk...
Chicken Little: Abby, Abby, Abby Iisten! Talking's a waste of time. I got to do something great so my dad doesn't think I'm such a Ioser.
Abby: Come on. You are not a Ioser.You're inventive and resourceful and funny and cute and...
Chicken Little: What?
Abby: [chuckling, stammering] Yeah... uh, Runt! Should Chicken Little have a good talk with his dad and clear the air or keep searching for Band-Aid solutions and never deal with the problem?
Runt: Band-Aid solutions!
Abby: Runt!
Runt: Well, I'm sorry! I'm very bad at reading facial cues.
Abby: [sighs] Fish, help me out here.
Fish: [muffled yells]
[water sloshing]
Abby: Men.
'Runt: Twas beauty that killed the beast.
Abby: I guess only girls are good at honest communication and sensitivity.
[class Iaughing]
Chicken Little: That does it! We were in a time-out, Foxy! Prepare to hurt. And I don't mean emotionally, Iike I do. Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! Whoa!
Runt: We will save you! Fall back! Mad goose!
Coach: Chicken Little!
Principal: Not showing up for class, inappropriate school attire, icking fights in gym class and the fire alarm? Ever since that "sky falling" incident, he's been nothing but trouble! [sighing] Now Iook, Buck. You know I have the utmost respect for you. I mean, you were Buck "Ace" CIuck, our school baseball star. [sighs] But Iet's face the facts. Your kid, he's nothing Iike you at all.
Buck: OK. Thank you for talking to me. I'II take care of my son.
Chicken Little: I... Dad, it wasn't my fault. It was Foxy. She's always...
Buck: AII right. It's fine. You don't have to explain anything.
Chicken Little: Uh... Hey, Dad? [clears throat] I was thinkin'. Yeah, what if I...? What if...? What if I joined the baseball team?
Man: Hey, why don't you watch where you're going?!
Buck: Sorry, there, buddy! Sorry, sorry. Baseball? Son, we talked about this.
Yeah, right. But, you know, that was when I was small.
I put on five ounces this year.
I've really bulked up.
Really, son? Baseball. Are you sure?
Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, you know, hey, why not, right?
- Yeah, why not, but why?
- Well, Dad, you were such a big baseball star in high school.
You could give me some pointers.
But, son, you know,
I'm just wondering...
Maybe baseball isn't exactly your thing, you know?
Have you considered the chess team or the glee club?
And some teenagers, you know, they get quite a rush from stamp collecting.
- No.
- Wanna stop? We'II get some stamps.
- I don't Iike stamps.
- Colors, colorful things...
No, I was thinkin' baseball!
I can't wait to see the Iook on your face when I smack that ball in for a touchdown!
Dad... Um, I'm kidding.
That was a... that was a joke.
Just do me one favor, son.
Why, sure, Dad. Anything.
Just please try not to get your hopes too high.
Yeah, but Dad, I mean, I...
I mean, I think I can...
[grunts, Iaughs]
I...
[stammering]
OK, Dad.
Buck: Oh, Chloe. If only you were here. You'd know what to do.
Dog: That's my boy!
Child: Gee, thanks, Dad!
Chicken Little: Come on. All I need is a chance.
[# Patti LaBelle and Joss Stone: Stir It Up]
Acorn Mascot: Lean to the left Lean to the right C'mon Acorns Fight, fight, fight! Go, Acorns!
Announcer: There's excitement in the air, Iadies and gentlemen. It's been two decades since Oakey Oaks has beaten rivals the Spud Valley Taters. Down by only a single run, and with a player in scoring position, we finally have a chance again. This excitement isn't about the fun of baseball, it's not about the prize. It's about gloating and rubbing their noses in it, the "Nah-nah-na-na-na! We beat you!" taunting, if you will, that comes with the winning.
Crowd: Yeah!
Announcer: That's right. Oakey Oaks and the Honorable Mayor Turkey Lurkey will finally have bragging rights again for one full year!
[chuckling, muttering]
Announcer: But this battle has taken a heavy toll on our hometown heroes. After nine grueling innings and several players out with injuries, the Acorns are scraping the bottom of the roster. Hopefully, there's just enough muscle on the bench to pull out a win. Up next... [shuddering] Chicken Little.
- [crowd groaning]
Announcer: CIearly a Iong shot, folks. Little hasn't been up to bat once since joining the team.
Cheetah: He's gonna Iose the game for us!
Announcer: But wait! If he can get a walk and advance to first, that powerhouse Foxy Loxy can step up and save us all. She's had a terrific game so far. A shoo-in for the MVP trophy.
Coach: OK, kid, Iisten up. You have an itty-bitty, teeny-tiny strike zone. There's no way he can throw you out! Just take the walk. Don't swing.
Chicken Little: I have a good feeling...
Coach: Look at me, Look at me. Don't swing. Take the walk. You hear me? Just take the walk!
Chicken Little: But, coach, wait!
Coach: Don't swing!
Announcer: Nervous, gangly, barely able to hold the pine, Little advances to the box. He's going to bat from the right. Make it the Ieft. No, the right. The right.
Gander: Easy out!
Announcer: Well sir, Left field's found something better to do, center field's got a hunger pang in his second stomach and right field's digging for grubs.
Umpire: PIay ball!
Cheetah: Why him? Why now? [sobbing]
Chicken Little: I won't embarrass you, Dad. Not this time.
Announcer: Here's the wind-up, the pitch! It's a high cutter.
Umpire: Ball! Uh... Strike one!
[Iaughing]
Announcer: Ladies and gentleman I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I've seen roadkill with faster reflexes. The catcher Iays down the signals. Here's the pitch. Curve ball Iow and outside, he swings!
Umpire: Stee-rike two!
Turky Lurkey: Ohh!
Coach: I said, don't swing!
Crowd: Don't swing!
Morkubine: No!
Umpire: Batter up!
[crowd yelling]
Announcer: That's two in the hole! One more strike, it's a punch out, folks, and we're all going home.
Chicken Little: [whispering] Today is a new day.
Coach: [slow-motion] Don't swing!
Announcer: Well, take away my squeaky toy! It's a hit!
Turkey Lurky: A hit?
Coach: A hit?
Chicken Little: A hit?
Crowd: A hit?
Announcer: The batter is unbelievably at home plate. He's standing in a daze. Run, kid, run!
Buck: Go, son! Run! Run!
[crowd yelling]
Turkey Lurky: Run!
Announcer: There he goes, headed the wrong way. Wait, wait, wait!
Buck: No, no, no! Not that way! Run the other way!
Abby: Turn around!
Announcer: Wait, wait, wait! He's turned! I've never said these words before, but he's actually rounding home plate! Goosey steps on home and...
Chicken Little: Today's new day! Today's new day!
Announcer: We have a tie game! They're scrambling in the alley. Looks Iike Rodriguez has it. Nope, it's the center fielder! Mayhem in the outfield, as Rodriguez is fired to second.
[blubbering]
Announcer: Catch is complete, but where's the ball? Little touches the bag and keeps going. A hunt for the rock. The fielders are having trouble. Commotion out there!
Cow: It's stuck! It's stuck!
Taters: Tip the Cow! Tip the cow!
Announcer: It's the old tip-the-cow play. He heads for the hot corner, a stand-up triple!
Buck: Yes!
Announcer: Hold up! No! Incredible! He's going for the whole enchilada! The ball of wax, kit and caboodle!
Foxy: Go back! Go back! You're never gonna make it!
Cow: [mooing]
Announcer: Look he tries to Iighten his Ioad! The outfield behind, Little's on all cylinders! He slides for the dish! It's going to be a photo finish at home!
Umpire: You're out!
Announcer: Oh, folks. Folks, what a heartbreaker.
Umpire: Wait!
Announcer: Wait, Wait! Wait a cotton-picking second. Hold your horses, here, and horses hold your breath. This might not be over. He... He's...
Umpire: Safe! The runner is safe!
Announcer: It's all over, folks! The Acorns have done the impossible! For the first time in 20 years, we won the pennant! Mothers, kiss your babies! You've witnessed a miracle! Remember where you were at this moment. The smells! The sounds! There's a new winner in town and his name is Chicken Little!
Foxy: That was just a Iucky hit!
Announcer: Yes, Chicken Little, it's all yours! The victory, the triumph, the glory! And getting doused with a sticky noise drink that soaks into your undies and chafes for hours! This is one memory you'II savor forever!
Yes, yes, yes! We won! We won!
That's my boy out there!
That's my boy!
Chicken Little: # I am the champion- My friend- And I'll keep on fightin' till the end- [imitating guitar riff] I am the champion- I am the champion- But gone is the loser- 'Cause I am the champion- Of the world!# Yow!
Buck: Here's the wind-up and the pitch!
Chicken Little: A knuckleball! right down in the middle!
Buck: He swings!
Chicken Little: Crack!
Buck: t's going.
Chicken Little: He rounds first, to second!
Buck: Hits high off the wall!
Chicken Little: He flies past third and heads for the plate!
Buck: It's a scramble for the ball! It's gonna be close! He is safe!
- Yes!
Both: Acorns win! The mighty Acorns win!
- Yeah!
Jeez, you know, I guess that puts the whole "sky is falling" incident behind us once and for all. Hey, kiddo?
You bet, Dad.
I... [clears throat]
Unless you think we need... closure?
CIosure? What's to close here?
Unless you think we need to close...
- Not me.
- It's closed!
- I agree. Vacuum sealed.
- Shut tight!
OK, great, Dad. You... CIosure, I dunno.
AII right. Enough fun.
Good talk. Good talk, son.
[straining]
- Here, I'II give you a push.
- Rock me a Iittle. Help me.
- OK.
- OK, I'm up.
Hey.
Good night, Ace.
Here's the wind-up... and the pitch!
Chicken Little: Whoo-hoo! Thanks. Thanks for the chance.
[whirring]
Chicken Little: [gasping] [grunting] Oh... [gasping] Noooooooo A piece of the sky?! Shaped Iike a stop sign?! Not again!
Buck: Hey! Son! You all right? I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm comin' upstairs! What's wrong?
Chicken Little: Nothing.
You sure? I thought I heard you yell.
Chicken Little: No. Uh, I, uh... I fell out of bed.
Buck: Huh? How'd you get over there?
Chicken Little Over where?
Buck: There.
Chicken Little: Where?
Buck: There! How'd you get over there?
Chicken Little: Who're we talking about?
Buck: Never mind. What's the difference? Look, the past is behind us, right?
Chicken Little: Mmm.
Buck: Tomorrow's gonna be a new day.

Chicken Little: AII right, guys. Watch this.
Abby: Bizarre. OK. Lemme guess. You haven't told your dad yet.
Chicken Little: Well...
Abby: I knew it! Why haven't you told him? There hasn't been - "you, your dad, talk-talk-talking."
Chicken Little: There was talking. There was definitely talking.
Abby: Really? What did he say?
Chicken Little: Uh... [mumbles gibberish]
Abby: What? AII right, that's it. We are doing an intervention! You have got to stop messing around and deal with the problem!
Runt: She's right!
Chicken Little: Abby, please. This is exactly what fell on me the first time. There's no way I'm bringing this up again with him.
Runt: No, he's not.
Abby: Runt!
Runt: Sorry! I'm a gutless flip-flopper.
Abby: OK. I'm sure there's a simple, Iogical explanation. I mean, it could be a piece of weather balloon, or maybe it's part of some experimental communications satellite.
Chicken Little: I don't care what it is. I just want it out of my Iife, gone for good. Everything back to normal.
Abby: Hey, remember when that icy blue stuff fell from the sky? Everybody thought it was from space and stuff? And it just turned out to be frozen pee from a jet airplane.
Runt: Yeah, that's right. It's frozen pee. Yeah. It's frozen pee. Pee, pee, pee, pee.

Chicken Little: Follow me! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! AIiens here! AIiens here!
Buck: It's... it's happening again.
Chicken Little: Come on! Hurry! Hurry! Come on. Come on. You're about to see it!
[The spaceship is starting to take off.]
Chicken Little: Quick! It's taking off! Come on! If you don't hurry, you're gonna miss it!
Turkey Lurky: Oh, Iook! A penny!
Chicken Little: Guys?!
Turkey Lurky: Oh, right.
Chicken Little: Hurry! Hurry! Come on! Quick! It's taking off! Come on! Hurry up! PIease! It's right in...
Reporter 1: What are we Iookin' for?
Reporter 2: I don't know.
Chicken Little: Uh, yeah. OK. I know this Iooks bad, but there's an invisible spaceship right there with aliens who are here to invade Earth! Let me show you. [grunting]
Reporter: Ooh, bad throw.
Chicken Little: OK, Iet me try again.
All: Bad throw.
Chicken Little: Okay. Well, we all know I don't have a very good arm, but you see, there's these cloaking panels on the bottom. They make it disappear. And I know this because one fell out of the sky and hit me right on the head.
Cheetah: Oh, it's the acorn thing all over again.
Reporter 1: Eh, there's no story here.
Reporter 2: Well, at Ieast we can sell the video to Chickens Gone Wild.
Chicken Little: I'm telling ya everybody, it was here!
Abby: No, wait! There were aliens!
Runt: It's true! They had eyes... They're glowing and then tentacles! And maps with planets with X's through them! Aah!
Runt's Mom: Runt, that's enough! Don't make Mommy take away your Streisand collection!
Runt: Mom? You Ieave Barbra out of this!
Principal: Why can't you keep that child of yours under control?
[Everyone arguing]
Woman: What kind of parent are you?
Chicken Little: I'm telling the truth. Dad! Dad! I'm not making this up! You gotta believe me this time.
Buck: No, son. I don't. [chuckling] I can't tell you how embarrassed I am, folks. I'm really sorry about this, everyone. Looks Iike this is just a big, crazy misunderstanding.
Turkey Lurky: Well, other than the penny, this whole evening was a wash!
Foxy: Oh, Mr. CIuck, don't take it so hard. No one blames you.
Announcer: Reports of panic and mayhem are pouring in after yet another Chicken Little incident last night. In one instance, a family of lemmings was sent running in fear, but unable to find a cliff, they instead began throwing themselves from the nearest park bench.
Buck: Hello? I'm sorry. Hello? I apologize. Hello? Give me a break! What? You were trampled? That's terrible. I thought rabbits' feet were supposed to be Iucky.
Computer: You have hate mail.
Buck: Sorry. That wasn't very funny.
Computer: You have more hate mail.
Buck: Hi. What are you saying, sir?
Computer: Your hate mail box is full.
Buck: Oh, yes. I do see the skywriting there. Thank goodness the cloud blocked the Iast Ietter. Hello? Hey! Watch your mouth. Yeah? Oh, yeah? Well, I'd Iike to see you try. OK, I Iove you too, Mom. Bye. Hello? Really. Well...
Abby: If there was ever a time to talk to your dad.....it's now.
Chicken Little: It's too Iate for that.
Runt: It's too Iate, baby, now it's too Iate. [sobbing] Though they really did try to make it.
Abby: Runt. Just think about it.
Runt: Something inside has died and they just can't hide and they just can't fake it. Oh, no, no.
Chicken Little: Runt, I really just want to be alone right now.
[He turned his head and saw the orange fuzz on the ground. Chicken little gasps, he slowly began to approach it until the orange fuzz bursts alive. It had three eyes four arms and a mouth. It was a real alien!]
Chicken Little: Aaaaaaah! Abby! Runt! Fish! Look! There! Look there! Look there!
Abby: Chicken little, what's wrong?
Runt: What is that thing?!
[Fish shushes them up. He then approached to the orange creature and gurgles. The alien started speaking alien language as Fish turns his head back to h is friends and gurgles.]
Chicken Little: His name is Kirby?
Abby: They Ieft him behind?
Runt: Darth Vader is Luke's father?
Chicken Little: Oh no... Come on, come on, don't cry. We're here for you. We're gonna do whatever it takes to get you back home okay? Here, blow. OK. [chuckling] See, guys? He's cool. He was just freaked out. That's all.
[Kirby speaking alien language]
Chicken Little: Those are your parents? And they brought the galactic armada?
[Kirby goes after them.]
Chicken Little: Watch out for the kid! Don't hit him!
Buck: Son, there you are. Get in the car. We gotta go.
Chicken Little: No wait. Dad, I gotta tell you something.
Buck: What? I know, I know! You were right! AIien invasion. I see that now. Look up! There it is!
Chicken little: Dad, you know, about that... It's actually a rescue mission.
Buck: Rescue mission?
Chicken Little: You see, this alien kid was Ieft behind by mistake and they're coming back to get him! So we have to help him, 'cause if we don't, who else will?
Buck: What?!
Chicken Little: Ugh! Forget it. You wouldn't believe me anyway.
Buck: Son! Son, come back! Son! Chicken Little!
Abby: Mr. CIuck! Wait! He's telling the truth!
Runt: He is! [gasping] Though, given his track record, we understand why you don't believe him!
[# R.E.M.: It's The End Of The World As We Know It]
Chicken Little: Watch out for the kid! No! Don't! Don't hit him! Don't hit... Look out!
Buck: Chicken Little!
Kirby: [screaming]
Buck: What? Where's your head? We gotta get outta here! Come on! Come... You, with the running and the jumping!
Chicken Little: Dad. No, wait.
Abby: What are you guys doing? We gotta get outta here! It's Iike War of the Worlds out there!
Buck: Stop pulling!
Chicken Little: I'm telling you! Just Iisten to me for one second! It's not dangerous!
Abby: We are under attack! Will you two stop messing around and deal with the problem?
Chicken Little: You're never there for me!
Buck: What?
Abby: OK, that's not what I had in mind, but...
Chicken Little: You're never there for me. I mean, you were when I won the game, but not when I thought the sky fell. And not at the ball field and certainly not now!
Abby: This is good! Keep going. Keep going!
Chicken Little: You've been ashamed ever since the acorn thing happened and we have to talk because Modern Mallard says avoiding closure can Iead to molting. I'm already small and on top of that, I don't think I could handle being bald!
Buck: I... I... I didn't.....realize, son. I-I never meant to... The acorn, the sky, I mean, the whole... You're right. You're right. Y... Your mom, she was... You know, she was always good with stuff Iike this. Me... [chuckles] ...I'm gonna need a Iot of work. But you need to know that I Iove you, no matter what. And I'm sorry I... And I'm sorry if I ever made you feel Iike that was something... ...you had to earn.
Abby: And we're good. Let's go. Let's go.
Chicken little: Okay, Dad. AII we gotta do is return helpless Iittle Kirby.
Buck: Return this whatever it is? This is crazy! Crazy! Crazy wonderful! Just tell me what you need me to do.
Chicken Little: Do you really mean it?
Buck: You bet! Anything, son.
Chicken Little: Come on, Dad. We've got a planet to save!
Buck: Crazy supportive. That's me! Ohh! This thing Iikes to nibble, doesn't it? [chuckling]
Chicken Little: By the way, I'd Iike to say I've always found you extremely attractive!
Abby: [chuckling] Now that's closure.
Runt: Wait! Wait! What's goin' on?! Oh, they've given her an alien mind-wipe! Aaah!
Buck: OK, son. What do we do now?
Chicken Little: Uh, OK. This is a piece of cake, Dad. AII we have to do is take the kid down the street to the giant metal alien.
Turkey Lurky: We surrender! Here! Take the key to the city! Key to my car? Tic Tac?
Chicken Little: Forget plan A!
Buck: Uh-oh. OK, OK, what now, son? Who, by the way, I support 100 percent.
Chicken Little: Uh, plan B?
Buck: Ha-ha! Of course! PIan B! What is plan B?
[Kirby: jabbering] Pooteetah! Pooteetah!
Buck: What? You have to go to the bathroom? You want juice? A snack? Corn dog on a stick? Want to play some golf? What do you want?!
Kirby: Pooteetah!
Buck: I stink at this. I'm a horrible father.
[Kirby speaks alien Ianguage] Boka toki.
Buck: No, no, I am.
Kirby: Poo-tee-tah.
Chicken Little: Oh. Is that your parents?
Kirby: Pooteetah, pooteetah. [sputtering]
Chicken Little: That's it, Dad! PIan B! AII we have to do is duck and weave through traffic ane make our way through town square while avoiding the death rays from alien robots. Then we get to Town Hall, climb up to the highest point of the roof and give the kid back to its parents.
Buck: Yeah! Charge!
[????]
Buck: Now that's what I call takin' out the trash! OK, son. Now what?
Chicken Little: Fire truck!
Both: PIan C!
Chicken Little: Runt, no! Turn around! Go back to Town Hall!
Runt: But they'II vaporize us!
Fish: [gurgling]
Runt: You want me to do what?
Chicken Little: Runt, just do it! It'II work! We'II survive!
Runt: I will survive? Brake, Abby!
- [# I Will Survive]
Abby: OK.
Runt: FIoor it!
Abby: [giggles] Boink.

Runt: Deploy Iadder, Fish!

[Runt] # I'll survive I will survive Hey, hey #
Buck: PIan D.
Kirby: PIan D!
Buck: Yeah!
Kirby: Yeah!
Buck: [panting] Thighs hurting. Drumsticks burning. But Ioving you! [groaning] Full support!
[Kirby squeaks]
Buck: I can't get out! Come back, son! We can't go out this way! It's dangerous.
Chicken Little: No, Dad, I can do this!
Buck: It's too dangerous.
Chicken Little: I can do this. I can. You gotta believe me this time.
Buck: I... I do, son.
Chicken Little: OK, hang on tight.
[???]
Buck: Yes!
Chicken Little: Here's your kid! Look over here! Here's your kid! He's OK! He's all right! Stop the invasion!
Buck: Son! Son! I'm here, son!
Chicken Little: Dad! Look out!
Buck: Get away from my boy! Get away!
Both: The mighty Acorns...
- [zapping]
[both yelling]
Turkey Lurky: Tic Tac?
Melvin: Why did you take our child?
Buck: Hey, hey! Just... [gulps] Just hold on there, buddy! My son did not take your kid! You were the one that Ieft him behind! That's bad parenting! And I should know!
Melvin: Silence! [echoing] Release the child!
Chicken Little: OK. OK, OK.
Tina: Sweetheart! Oh, Kirby, I'm so happy to see you! My darling!
Buck: [sighs] That was close.
Chicken Little: At Ieast they're back together.
Buck: They got their kid.
Melvin: You have violated intergalactic Iaw 90210! A charge punishable by immediate particle disintegration!
Buck: Oh, snap.
Kirby: [jabbering]
Melvin: Hmm? What's that?
Kirby: [jabbering]
Melvin: Hmm. I... I don't quite...
Tina: Melvin, honey? He's saying they're telling the truth. It was just a misunderstanding.
[Kirby jabbering]
Melvin: Well, then. This is awkward.
Tina: Yes, it is.
Melvin: I suppose I should...
Tina: Put the big guns away?
Melvin: Yes, yes.
Tina: Now put them down.
Melvin: Of course.
Tina: And turn off your big voice.
Melvin:But I don't...
Tina: Turn it off.
Melvin: But... But I don't get to use the big voice very often!
Tina: Melvin.
Melvin: Yes, dear. Hi. Uh, anyone want to try the big voice? [Iaughing] Again, I cannot tell you how sorry we are for this whole misunderstanding.
Tina: Oh, dear goodness. We are so very sorry.
Melvin: Yes we are. And if it hadn't been for your son there, well, we might have vaporized the whole planet.
Buck: What?
Tina: Oh my goodness! What a shame that would have been. I mean, where else would we pick our acorns?
Melvin: We stop here every summer on the way to the in-Iaws.
Tina: Every year.
Melvin: Oh yeah. Looked on all the other planets and you only find them right here on Earth.
Tina: Just as it says here on your primitive graphic display.
Melvin: That caught our eyes.
Alien Officer: OK, everything's been put back to normal, except for this one, over here.
Foxy: Hi, y'all!
Chicken Little: Foxy?
Alien Officer: She got her brainwaves scrambled during reconstitution. But no worries! We can put her back the way she was.
Runt: No! She's perfect.
Both: Lollipop! Lollipop! #
Alien Officer: Scary.
Melvin: Whoops! Darling! Look at the time! We better get a move on. AII right, then. It was good meetin' ya. Sorry for the whole full-scale invasion thing. But, hey, I'm a dad. You know how it is with your kids. When they need ya, you do whatever it takes.
Tina: [sighs] There goes that panel again. Every year we come here, this thing falls off. Seriously honey, someday it's going to hit somebody on the head.
Melvin: Nonsense!
Tina: You can't return the panel., can ya?
Melvin: Now that's ridiculous.
Tina: You threw away the receipt again.
Melvin: [echoing] Silence!
Tina: Melvin, did you just try and use the big voice on me?
Melvin: Um... uh... Who we talkin' about?
Buck: So I'd Iike to see the movie they make about you now.
Chicken Little: I just hope they stay true to what really happened.
Buck: Oh, son, these people are from Hollywood! The one thing they'II never do is mess with a good story.

Movie Runt: No, no. Ya gotta go on without me, commander. Just leave me some ammo, a little water, some chips if you have 'em.
