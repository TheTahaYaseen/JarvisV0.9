[ Gwen Stefani featuring Eve:
Rich Girl]
<br/>  
She's on her way.
<br/>  
[woman] Good morning, Viv.
<br/>  
Hello, Willow. Lovely to see you.
<br/>  
- [woman] Here she comes!
- [man] Is that the new Louis Vuitton?
<br/>  
[man 2] I might've known
she'd be the first.
<br/>  
[woman 2] Fabulous bag. She's so chic.
<br/>  
Sorry I'm late.
We had to do a little shopping.
<br/>  
Now that's the way to travel.
I'm so jealous.
<br/>  
Faboo!
<br/>  
Louis Vuitton never looked so good.
<br/>  
Mmm. Tell me the stones
in that collar are not real.
<br/>  
Aren't they gorgeous?
Viv said I had to have it.
<br/>  
[dogs barking]
<br/>  
- Sorry keep you waiting.
- Armand, it's fine.
<br/>  
A brush and a seaweed wrap,
but I need her by noon.
<br/>  
- We're having lunch with my niece.
- She'll be ready.
<br/>  
I know, sweetheart. I'm going to miss
you, too. You take good care of her.
<br/>  
- No waxing, OK?
- OK, no waxing for her.
<br/>  
I hope she gives me a red bow.
I want to look my best today.
<br/>  
- Bimini has a date with Scooter.
- Nice pedigree.
<br/>  
Please! The dog chases parked cars.
<br/>  
- He's crazier than a Labradoodle.
- I give it a week, tops.
<br/>  
- Hey! Talk to the paw.
- [Chloe] Good for you, Bimini.
<br/>  
It's not easy to find a mate with
papers. Let alone one you could love.
<br/>  
Me, I'd be happy with
one who's not... fixed.
<br/>  
[chuckles]
<br/>  
- [whistles]
- [Chloe laughs]
<br/>  
Down, boy.
<br/>  
[ Kylie Minogue:
Wow]
<br/>  
[woman] All right, what's next?
<br/>  
- What do you think?
- Please. She wears Harry Winston.
<br/>  
Viv?
<br/>  
Fabulous. I'll take two.
You should see Chloe.
<br/>  
I'll need at least two days at corporate
in New York to meet with buyers.
<br/>  
- You have a little beret?
- Perfection.
<br/>  
[speaks Italian]
<br/>  
Who needs sleep? It's Italy.
<br/>  
Preppy little beauty.
<br/>  
- This just came in.
- She's allergic to wool. No.
<br/>  
- Love that.
- [Viv] Oh! Fabulous!
<br/>  
- Viv.
- I love it. And do you love it?
<br/>  
You may have it.
I'll get you anything you want.
<br/>  
Yes, I will. No, not you, Patrick.
<br/>  
Hello, Jackie O.
<br/>  
- Love the smell of dirt in the morning.
- Sam, the garden looks gorgeous.
<br/>  
And I love the new designs
for the waterfall that you did.
<br/>  
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
<br/>  
For everything. For giving me
a chance to prove myself.
<br/>  
Oh, good job, Papi. Very symmetrical.
<br/>  
[Sam speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
Ciao. Ciao, Papi.
<br/>  
Yes, yes. We did it, Papi.
Yes. Yes!
<br/>  
Go on, take a break, Papi.
You're doing great, buddy.
<br/>  
Hello, beautiful.
<br/>  
You're blocking my sun.
<br/>
much brighter than the sun
<br/>
<br/>  
- What's that smell?
- Which one?
<br/>  
The sweat of my labor
or the mint patch I rolled in for you?
<br/>  
- Neither.
- Then it must be the fertilizer.
<br/>  
Gross! You're covered in it.
<br/>  
Of course. I am a landscaper.
<br/>  
Grasshopper, mi corazón?
<br/>  
I caught it myself. Very tasty.
<br/>  
Papi, that's so... disgusting.
<br/>  
I see you're tempted. I'll leave it here
in case you change your mind.
<br/>  
- [doorbell rings]
- Excuse me. We have guests.
<br/>  
Guests? You got guests... OK.
<br/>  
You want to go have a drink later?
There's a great puddle by the garage.
<br/>  
OK, never mind.
<br/>  
Aunt Viv! I'm here!
<br/>  
[Chloe] An hour late, as usual.
<br/>  
- Aunt Viv, hello!
- [barking]
<br/>  
How do you keep a job?
Oh, that's right, you don't.
<br/>  
Where's Aunt Viv?
Where's Aunt Viv? Chloe, go find her.
<br/>  
- Go on. Go find her.
- Who am I, Lassie?
<br/>  
You're so completely useless.
<br/>  
Of course I understand.
<br/>  
[Viv] It's just that I'm headed to
Europe to promote my new cosmetic line.
<br/>  
No, this is wonderful news.
It's the best news.
<br/>  
Yes, yes. OK. Wonderful. Bye.
<br/>  
- Is everything OK, Aunt Viv?
- I don't know what I'm going to do.
<br/>  
I am getting on a plane at 4:00,
and I gave the staff the week off...
<br/>  
and Chloe's dog nanny just
had her baby three weeks early.
<br/>  
- You're not taking Chloe with you?
- No, no.
<br/>  
Obviously if it was a vacation,
of course, but this is a business trip.
<br/>  
Four cities in ten days.
<br/>  
She's much too delicate for that kind
of travel. Plus she hates Berlin.
<br/>  
- What about a kennel?
- [Chloe] Kennel?
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
No, no. I could never leave her
in the hands of strangers.
<br/>  
Never in a million years.
<br/>  
But you're not a stranger.
<br/>  
- What?
- What?
<br/>  
Here is Chloe's schedule.
Try to stay to it as much as possible.
<br/>  
I could skip the dog park on Wednesday
<br/>  
because Chloe's friend, Stella,
came down with fleas.
<br/>  
I'm about to entrust you with
my greatest treasure.
<br/>  
Take good care.
<br/>  
I love you, sweetheart.
<br/>  
I love you so much.
Mommy loves you so much.
<br/>  
Bye-bye! Have fun, you two!
<br/>  
- OK. Bye!

[ Right Said Fred:
I'm Too Sexy]
<br/>  
Here you go. Good luck.

[ball squeaking]
<br/>  
[dogs barking]
<br/>  
Don't worry, Chloe.
Viv will be back before you know it.
<br/>  
Rachel doesn't look so bad.
<br/>  
You don't know the half of it.
<br/>  
[girl] They all look so cute
in their little outfits.
<br/>  
You didn't have to dress her.
She's so picky.
<br/>  
- You're talking about a Chihuahua.
- She's not any Chihuahua, Angela.
<br/>  
She's a bossy, arrogant, manipulative,
Beverly Hills Chihuahua.
<br/>  
She has no direction. She can't keep
a job. She's never on time.
<br/>  
I'm going to be late to my appointments.
<br/>  
Don't get me started on her schedule.
<br/>  
Shiatsu massages, doggy birthday
parties, couture fittings.
<br/>  
I have to change
her outfit four times a day.
<br/>  
I mean, look at her.
<br/>  
[both] She's so...
<br/>  
...irresponsible.
...spoiled.
<br/>  
- Woof.
- [sighs]
<br/>  
- I need to cool off.
- Dive in, girl.
<br/>  
Whoa!
<br/>  
Hi, mami.
<br/>  
Oh!
<br/>  
Who is that hunk
of Chihuahua over there?
<br/>  
- [Bimini] Nice.
- Mi corazón!
<br/>  
The gardener.
<br/>  
You are more lovely...
<br/>  
- than the dawn.
- Wow.
<br/>  
Mi corazón!
<br/>  
You are more lovely...
than the dawn!
<br/>  
So embarrassing. Maybe he'll go away.
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
I only...
<br/>  
Excuse me while I bravely defend
your garden against that dangerous bird.
<br/>  
Hey, bird!
<br/>  
That is one hot dog.
<br/>  
Excuse me.
Coming through. Nice legs.
<br/>  
Mud all over me.
<br/>  
Hey, hey! Excuse me!
<br/>  
Excuse me! Excuse me, señor?
Gardener guy?
<br/>  
Your dog is muy bad.
Muy, muy, muy bad. Mucho naughty.
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
Can you get... your...
<br/>  
...doggie-o out of here?
<br/>  
Perdóname, por favor,
but my heart must speak.
<br/>  
I only wish to say...
<br/>  
that if you ever need someone
to lick inside your ears...
<br/>  
or chew the hard to reach places...
<br/>  
or share your slumber in the sun...
<br/>  
I would be most honored
to be that special someone.
<br/>  
- Woof.
- Put your tongue back in your mouth.
<br/>  
Oh. I don't think so, Papi.
<br/>  
You mean, not now.
<br/>  
I mean... not ever.
<br/>  
I see. Of course. Well...
<br/>  
This thing.

a most wonderful day.

You're a genius.
<br/>  
Yes, I can be ready
in 30 minutes. OK, bye!

- Let's check it out.
- Surfer boys, hi!
<br/>  
Hi.
<br/>  
I love this town!
<br/>  
I could totally live here.
Isn't this great?
<br/>  
I'm starting to get the feeling
there's no Four Seasons here.
<br/>  
Whoo!

- Third floor, baby.
- Woo!
<br/>  
Hello? Somebody forget something?
<br/>  
- I'm walking by myself.
- [Rachel] Chloe!
<br/>  
I'm starving.
What's taking them so long?
<br/>  
Wait. What time are
we supposed to meet the guys?
<br/>  
Right now, at that club.
<br/>  
Wait a minute. I forgot
the name of the club.
<br/>  
- Cayuca Club!
- Right. Cayuca!
<br/>  
Be right back.
<br/>  
- Dinner time!
- Finally.
<br/>  
You should dance with Bryan, Rache.
<br/>  
- I'm gonna dance with him.
- He's cute!
<br/>  
You'd better be making me
either prime rib or reservations.
<br/>  
There you go.
<br/>  
You're joking, right?

I am ready to dance all night!

There's only one thing this is good for.

- Try this on for size.
- Come on, let's go!

That's a bad dog!
That's a very bad dog!

<br/>  
Rachel. What did you do to her?
<br/>  
Nothing! She's faking! Let's go.
<br/>  
- You silly girl.
- She's so cute.
<br/>  
- We should take her with us.
- Yes! Take me out for food.
<br/>  
- I'm not taking the dog dancing.
- Cayuca!
<br/>  
Hey! Wait!
<br/>  
Come back here! Oops.

Just add that to the bill.

Hola and adiós.

You want to dance, Rachel? Let's dance.
<br/>  
OK. Guy with a giant knife. Moving on.

If I wasn't starving,
this might actually be fun.

Oh! There you are.

You are in so much troub...

Put me down! Who are you?

- Seriously?

for breakfast in the morning!

Chloe's missing.
<br/>  
I don't know where she would go.
She doesn't like to walk anywhere,

- let alone run.
- Well...
<br/>  
- What?
- Las peleas de perros were in town.
<br/>  
Dogfights. They're criminals.
Always on the move.
<br/>  
How do I find them?
<br/>  
I have heard rumors.
<br/>  
Mexico City?

Then there's nothing more you can do.
<br/>  
You've done everything you can.

Why don't you go
put your suit on and join us?

I'm going to keep looking for Chloe.

And if I can't find her,
I'm going to Mexico City.

Where am I?
<br/>  
You're in the dogfights.
<br/>  
Dogfights? What?
<br/>  
This is outrageous.

I was born to shop, not fight.
Unless it's at a sales rack.

- Quit whining, princesa.
- Chloe Winthrop Ashe does not whine.

A delusional Chihuahua.

<br/>  
A gladiator?
<br/>  
You know. A fighter.
Delgado is the best of the best.
<br/>  
Don't listen to Rafa, chica.
El Diablo's the meanest dog in the fights.
<br/>  
Word is they fought once before,
and Delgado did not come out on top.
<br/>  
[praying in Spanish]
<br/>  
What's he saying?
<br/>  
Ay, bendito, he always
prays before a fight.
<br/>  
Don't you speak any Spanish,
chica?
<br/>  
The name's Chloe, not chica.
And why would I speak Spanish?
<br/>  
- Hello! You're a Chihuahua, mi hija!
- So?
<br/>  
I'm from Beverly Hills. You know, 90210,
the shopping capital of the world?
<br/>  
She's a gringa from California.
<br/>  
That's right. The only reason
I'm here is because I was stolen.
<br/>  
- You think I volunteered for this?
- [Chloe] But I'm an heiress.
<br/>  
- A hairless?
- No, an heiress.
<br/>  
- I have a trust fund.
- Look.
<br/>  
If you're worth something,
they'll ransom you.
<br/>  
And if they ransom you,
they won't fight you.
<br/>  
- Guess you have nothing to worry about.
- Well, that's a relief.
<br/>  
I am so glad you feel better.
Now can we get a little quiet?

you're the gardener, right?

- I'm Sam.
- Your garden is muy bonita.
<br/>  
And when I get a casa,
I'm so calling you to be my gardener...

- because it's...
- Thank you very much.
<br/>  
- Where's Rachel?
- Forget her, dude. Where's Chloe?
<br/>  
And what are you hiding there?
<br/>  
Chloe's lost in Mexico.
Rachel stayed to find her.

is out there in trouble?

The Carthay? There's one here.
Would they know you?
<br/>  
They should. We're preferred guests.
We have a gold card.
<br/>  
Why me? Of all the dogs in Mexico.
<br/>  
Why me? All I need,
Chihuahua with booties.
<br/>  
This'll be fun! You'll see.
<br/>  
Here's the GPS.
<br/>  
We're hot.
<br/>  
Diablo, you go get me that Chihuahua.
<br/>  
Go! Go!

<br/>  
- Hold up a second.
- Uh...
<br/>  
What's that sound?
<br/>  
- Hmm. Hold your breath.
- [Chloe shrieks]
<br/>  
- What did you do that for?
- El Diablo's got your scent.
<br/>  
Of course he does. It's Chanel No. 5.
<br/>  
- Congratulations.
- Now I've lost another bootie...
<br/>  
- and I stink.
- I don't smell anything.
<br/>  
Are you kidding? I smell like a wet dog.
<br/>  
You are a wet dog.

<br/>  
- Look... señorita...
- Ashe.
<br/>  
Ashe. I'm sorry.
<br/>  
We're already trying to stop the fights.
<br/>  
And we don't have time to look
for every lost dog in Mexico.
<br/>  
This is not just any dog.
<br/>  
This is my Aunt Viv's dog.
Chloe means everything to her.
<br/>  
I'll tell you what.
<br/>  
Go back to your hotel, download
that photo you were telling me about
<br/>  
and I will see what I can do.
<br/>  
- Gracias.
- You're welcome!
<br/>  
[Mexican Hat Dance ringtone]
<br/>  
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Ciao, Rachel.
<br/>  
Yes, Capri's fantastic.
<br/>  
I was trying the house earlier.
I was worried because nobody was there.
<br/>  
Yeah, we went out for Mexican.

Could I talk to her just a second?
<br/>  
Um... I'll put her on.

OK, here you are,

<br/>  
- Thank you, Delgado. Thank you!
- All in a day's work.
<br/>  
But... maybe you should wait out here.
<br/>  
- Yeah, whatever.
- I don't mean it like it sounds,
<br/>  
but they can be a little particular
about the dogs they let in.
<br/>  
Knock yourself out.
<br/>  
We'll be eating gourmet food in no time.

- Bienvenidos al Hotel Carthay.
- [Chloe] Thank you.

as to look at my collar?
<br/>  
You'll find my owner's
name and number.

<br/>  
Tshh! Get out!
<br/>  
Hello! Ew!
<br/>  
It touched me!

Get this mutt out of here.
<br/>  
- Mutt? How dare you!
- [concierge] Edgar!
<br/>  
I've been a preferred customer
at this hotel for years!
<br/>  
Don't you dare!
<br/>  
- I'm sorry.
- You are making a big mistake. Huge.
<br/>  
Really! [shrieks]
<br/>  
Oh, no.

I'm...
<br/>  
I'm... hideous.

<br/>  
Hmm. Figures.

Isn't it obvious? To find Chloe.
<br/>  
Angela told me everything.
<br/>  
Why did you pretend
you couldn't speak English?
<br/>  
I didn't. You just assumed.
<br/>  
Thought you'd let me go along
and make a fool of myself?
<br/>  
Didn't need any help with that.
<br/>  
What makes you think
I need help from a gardener?
<br/>  
Oh, no, she didn't.
<br/>  
It's not that I have a
problem with that word, but,
<br/>

<br/>  
I'm here for Vivian,

I e-mailed a description
of the dog's collar to all our stations.
<br/>  
Chloe's collar. It's worth a fortune.
<br/>  
You're welcome.
<br/>  
Maybe a picture of the collar
might be even more helpful.
<br/>  
Yeah, a lot. Gracias.
<br/>  
So what should we do now?
<br/>  
We? Nothing.
<br/>  
You go back to
your hotel and wait. Please.
<br/>  
He's right. There's nothing you can do.
<br/>  
What? We're Mexi-can, not Mexi-can't!

I'm not going to stop looking.

No, that really isn't necessary.

OK. Thank you, thank you.

Ooh.
<br/>  
Hey, you guys don't think
Chloe's in trouble, do you?
<br/>  
Paa-lease. I bet Rachel whisked her
off to some faboo place.
<br/>  
If I know Chloe...
<br/>  
she's sitting under a palm tree
being waited on by some hunky husky.
<br/>  
Oh! Thank you!
<br/>  
[groans] I must be starving.
<br/>  
- Yeah. That's our churro.
- Sí, our churro.
<br/>  
Excuse me, but... I saw it first!
<br/>  
- Better back off, muchachos.
- [laughing]
<br/>  
Looks like we have
one of those Chihuahua warriors!

Now look, I've been dognapped,

in a series of bad hair days.

- Let's get out of here, man.
- Sorry... sorry.

- Now we're trapped.
<br/>  
- Now what?
- I'm thinking, I'm thinking.
<br/>  
Why did you abandon me?
<br/>  
I've already been abandoned once.
<br/>  
You left me, I didn't leave you!

was a used churro.

Who's Vasquez?
<br/>  
He runs the dog fights and anything
else he can make a quick buck at.
<br/>  
The police have been after him
for years, but he's slippery.

- [Chloe] What's your plan?

shut, and wait for me to come back.

But... where are you going?

back to Beverly Hills.

on her collar.

So take her to a rescue shelter.

- They'll read it and call the owner.
- Not that simple.

He's even got El Diablo after her.
<br/>  
El Diablo. That's why you're doing it?

Yeah, OK. Bring it to me.

- I'll see what I can do.
- Gracias.
<br/>  
Come on, let's go.
I found someone to read your tag.
<br/>  
- Really? So did I.
- Where's your collar?
<br/>  
You're not the only one
who can get things done.
<br/>  
- What?
- I gave my collar to Manuel...

He is taking it to
the ship's captain to read.
<br/>  
Manuel? Who's Manuel?
<br/>

who's helping me out.

I saved him from
being eaten by an iguana.

That is the oldest con in the book!
Iguanas are vegetarians!

I'm sorry. I don't meet
many iguanas on Rodeo Drive.

there's nothing to separate you
from any collarless stray on the street!

But... Well...
<br/>  
Manuel promised me
he'd be right back from the ship.
<br/>  
What ship? That ship?
<br/>  
What happened to the
"don't talk to strangers"?
<br/>  
You said nothing about iguanas.

angel?" American dogs are so gullible.

<br/>  
You are. And now,
can we steal some lunch? I'm hungry.

- Where did you get that?
- Please don't eat me, man!

- Eat him first!
- Where is the Chihuahua?
<br/>

Of course if you'd like to meet one,
I could arrange it for the right price.

You're about to be lunch.

That's the right price.
How'd you know?
<br/>  
Do something, Manuel.
<br/>  
You're trying my patience,

<br/>  
Stop trying his patience.
<br/>  
- Where is she?
- By the fountain, near the docks.

I didn't know she was a friend of yours.
I was just borrowing it.

Please don't hurt me.

<br/>  
Hmm. Hmm.
<br/>

I didn't cha-cha on his chest.

You know, Manuel, I don't think
that dog was a friend of hers.

It's not our problem, Chico.

Come on, let's go raid a piñata.

- Uh, Delgado?
- Yeah?
<br/>  
What are we doing here?

- This is where we meet the coyote.
- A coyote?
<br/>  
A smuggler. They sneak collarless dogs
like us across the border.
<br/>  
You used to be a police dog, didn't you?
<br/>  
That's how you know Sergeant Tomas.
That's how you can do all those things.
<br/>  
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Did you quit? Did you get fired?
<br/>  
Did you do something wrong?
<br/>  
Yes, I did something wrong, OK?
You satisfied?
<br/>  
Now, just drop it.
<br/>  
OK. OK.
<br/>  
There he is. We're on. Follow me.
<br/>  
- And no more questions.
- OK. OK.
<br/>  
- But what was it? Was someone hurt?
- [Delgado] Drop it! Just drop it!

You're not exactly the most charming
traveling companion either.

- Good, because we're parting ways.
- What?

I'm going to go
all kinds of Mexican on him.
<br/>  
Chico, I have this pain
in the pit of my stomach.
<br/>  
- Must have been the Pop Rocks.
- Or it could be... guilt.
<br/>  
We should have never
stolen that chica's collar.
<br/>  
Now she'll never get home.
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
[both screaming]
<br/>  
Let's get out of here!
<br/>  
[makes donkey-like sounds]
<br/>  
[panting]
<br/>  
Make a left, make a left.
<br/>  
Aisle four, tortillas on the floor.
<br/>  
- I feel naked.
- Every man for himself!
<br/>  
- My head!
- Go through his legs!
<br/>  
This way. Come on!
<br/>  
Back the other way!
<br/>  
Get off me!
<br/>  
Hey, Chico! We're home free!
<br/>  
Back up, back up!
<br/>  
That's what you get!
<br/>  
Hey! He's got my diamonds!
<br/>  
- Our diamonds.
- Whatever.
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
[train horn blows]
<br/>  
Wake up! The conductor's coming!
Hide! Rápido, hide!
<br/>  
[indistinct chatter]
<br/>  
What's going on?
<br/>  
- Delgado, what's happening?
- We got trouble.
<br/>  
Hide behind the crate.
I'll distract him.
<br/>  
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.
<br/>  
But, Delgado...
<br/>  
Don't come out,
no matter what happens.
<br/>  
- What are you gonna do?
- Something crazy.
<br/>  
- [screaming]
- [crashing]
<br/>  
Well, that used to be easier.
<br/>  
Just my luck.
<br/>  
Delgado!
<br/>  
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my back.
<br/>  
- Did you see that?
- Yes.
<br/>  
I just jumped off a train!
By myself! And it was moving.
<br/>  
I told you to stay onboard.
<br/>  
But we're in this together.
I couldn't leave you here.
<br/>  
I've never had a friend like you.
<br/>  
You should have stayed, kid.
Look around.
<br/>  
You should have stayed.
<br/>  
I told the local police
I found the collar on a rat.
<br/>  
But they didn't believe me.
<br/>  
I went to turn the diamonds in,
and they tried to arrest me.
<br/>  
Sorry for the confusion, señor.
<br/>  
The rat, he's clever.
<br/>  
Oye, this hombre
needs help.
<br/>  
I set traps to keep him out,
but he always gets in!
<br/>  
Sneaky, sneaky mouse.
<br/>  
You know what you need?
<br/>  
- [barks]
- A guard dog.
<br/>  
- He's a stray.
- Yeah, he's a stray...
<br/>  
but he's a really good dog.
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
[Rachel] Thanks for
returning Chloe's collar.
<br/>  
Congratulations, amigo.
You have a home.
<br/>  
Gracias, Rafa.
It will happen for you, too.
<br/>  
Stay brown, brother.
<br/>  
Come on.
Ain't nothing to it but to do it.
<br/>  
- Adiós
- Adiós, Chucho.
<br/>  
Hey, don't chew the furniture.
<br/>  
- Good luck finding your dog.
- [Sam] Thank you.
<br/>  
I just got off
with the Puerto Vallarta police.
<br/>  
There was some dog trouble
on the northbound train this morning.
<br/>  
A German Shepherd jumped off.
<br/>  
Chloe.
<br/>  
- Thank you.
- Call me if you find out anything.
<br/>  
- [Rachel] Follow the tracks north.
- [Sam] Through the Sonoran Desert.
<br/>  
[Rachel] This will be great.
<br/>  
She's getting away with my diamonds.
<br/>  
[Chico] I think that that's like...
karma, man.
<br/>  
See, you steal it,
and eventually it is stolen from you.
<br/>  
And I steal it back.
<br/>  
- How you going to do that?
- Quiet!
<br/>  
[ War:
Low Rider]
<br/>  
[Chloe] So, Bimini says that
she's going out with Scooter...
<br/>  
who I happen to know
is completely crazy.
<br/>  
[Delgado] Please, make it stop.
<br/>  
[Chloe] I can't say that to her.
I have to be supportive, right?
<br/>  
Wait a minute. Haven't we
passed this tree before?
<br/>  
No, you're mistaken.
We've been walking for hours.
<br/>  
- But I tinkled there.
- You what?
<br/>  
You tinkled?
<br/>  
Can't you tell?
<br/>  
Oh, my... You can't smell, can you?
<br/>  
[groans]
<br/>  
- No.
- What happened?
<br/>  
It's OK, you can tell me.
<br/>  
I didn't... quit the police force.
<br/>  
They let me go because
I could no longer follow a scent.
<br/>  
Now we're out here walking in circles.
<br/>  
I'm sorry, kid.
<br/>  
[distant growling]
<br/>  
- What's that?
- Mountain lions!
<br/>  
- I'm scared, Delgado.
- I know.
<br/>  
We better get moving.
We got to get out of the open.
<br/>  
- OK.
- Let's go. Double time.
<br/>  
Delgado, what happened to you?
<br/>  
Why can't you smell anything?
<br/>  
Well...
<br/>  
My partner and I...
we were on a major bust.
<br/>  
I was on point.
<br/>  
Before I knew it I was blind-sided.
Then it all went bad.
<br/>  
While I was down,
my partner got hurt.
<br/>  
He was never the same after that.
And neither was I.
<br/>  
I should have sensed him coming.
<br/>  
Next day I woke up
and couldn't smell a thing.
<br/>  
Were you hurt?
<br/>  
No. They say it's all in my head.
<br/>  
In my head.
<br/>  
[growl]
<br/>  
They found us!
<br/>  
I'll hold them off as long as I can
while you run. Understand?
<br/>  
They're just cats.
You could take them.
<br/>  
[growl]
<br/>  
We need a miracle. Run when I say run!
<br/>  
- Come on! Take them!
- [growls]
<br/>  
Yeah, you can do it!
<br/>  
Don't be afraid!
<br/>  
Go, Delgado! Go, Delgado!
<br/>  
- Run, kid! Run, now!
- OK, OK.
<br/>  
- Run and hide!
- Here. I'm here.
<br/>  
This is not hiding.
<br/>  
[rumbling]
<br/>  
[rumbling stops]
<br/>  
[dogs growling]
<br/>  
Say hello to my little friends.
<br/>  
[barking]
<br/>  
- [cats shriek]
- [barking]
<br/>  
Whoa! That's some bark you guys got.
<br/>  
I am Montezuma!
Come with us if you want to live.
<br/>  
Yeah, I want to live.
<br/>  
Now I've seen it all.
<br/>  
[Chloe] Can you help us get back
to civilization, Montezuma?
<br/>  
[Montezuma] Of course.
<br/>  
But it is too dangerous
to travel these canyons after dark.
<br/>  
You will spend the night here with us.
<br/>  
[Chloe] Where are we?
<br/>  
You are in Chihuahua.
Birthplace of our mighty breed.
<br/>  
I was born in Beverly Hills.
<br/>  
Sí, but your ancestors
came from here.
<br/>  
The Aztec people left long ago,
but we remain.
<br/>  
Wow.
<br/>  
[ Luis Oliveira and His Bandodalua Boys:
Chihuahua]
<br/>  
Did you hear what he said, Delgado?
<br/>  
- I come from a mighty breed.
- Yeah, mighty annoying.
<br/>  
You're just mad because
we were saved by little dogs.
<br/>  
Very little dogs.
<br/>  
Tonight we celebrate your arrival.
<br/>  
Thank you, Montezuma.
<br/>  
Please, call me Monte.
<br/>  
- [Chloe sighs]
- [Delgado] Ay yi yi.
<br/>  
[barking]
<br/>  
[Chloe] Wow! All this for me, Monte?
<br/>  
[Monte] Yes, Chloe.
<br/>  
When a Chihuahua comes home,
it is cause for celebration.
<br/>  
[Chloe] Even a Beverly Hills Chihuahua?
<br/>  
[Monte] Of course. No matter where
you come from, you are one of us.
<br/>  
Tiny but mighty.
<br/>  
Mighty? But I'm just... a lapdog.
<br/>  
A lapdog? No.
<br/>  
Do not insult yourself. Do not insult
the Chihuahua race.
<br/>  
- [all] No más.
- [Chloe] No más?
<br/>  
Sí, it means "no more."
<br/>  
We Chihuahuas are not toys
or fashion accessories.
<br/>  
[all] No más.
<br/>  
We were not bred to wear silly hats
and ride in purses!
<br/>  
[all] No más.
<br/>  
We will no longer
be spoken to with baby talk.
<br/>  
We have been called "teacup"
and "tiny toy" for too long.
<br/>  
[puppy] No más!
<br/>  
Names like Fifi, Foo-Foo...
<br/>  
Pookie, Pumpkin, or Squirt.
<br/>  
[all] No más!
<br/>  
Yes, we Chihuahuas shake, but not for
the amusement of humans.
<br/>  
We shake because we know the power
of our inner strength. Our bark.
<br/>  
[all] No más!
<br/>  
Yes, we are tiny, but we are mighty!
<br/>  
[all] No más! No más! No más!
<br/>  
Join with us, Chloe.
Embrace no más. Find your bark.
<br/>  
My bark?
<br/>  
Sí! That which makes you mighty.
<br/>  
That which makes you... you.
<br/>  
We are Chihuahuas, hear us roar.
<br/>

<br/>  
- [bark]
- [Chloe squeaks]
<br/>  
- [bark]
- [squeak]
<br/>

That was embarrassing.

Don't worry, little one. Your bark will
come when you need it most.

[Manuel] Come on. Little more.
<br/>  
- You got it now. Now pull.
- [Chico] I got it, I got it.
<br/>  
- Sweet smell of success.
- I'm smelling something else.
<br/>  
There's the bag. There's the bag that's
got my diamonds. Hey, watch your nose!
<br/>  
I don't feel right about this.
<br/>  
Look, my neck flap is swelling up.
<br/>  
Stop with the guilt.
Iguanas are supposed to be cold-blooded.
<br/>  
You know I was born in captivity.
I grew up under a heat lamp.
<br/>  
Snap out of it. We got a job to do.
<br/>  
Ah-hah! You're the pack rat
who stole the collar!
<br/>  
See? You're so busted, Manuel.
<br/>  
Hey, dude, you got me mixed up with
another rat. You know we all look alike.
<br/>  
- No, no. It's him. He did it.
- What?
<br/>  
Now the love of my life
is out there in trouble.
<br/>  
- Not because of us.
- No?
<br/>  
- We were trying to... save her.
- Yeah.
<br/>  
From the demon dog that's hunting her.
<br/>  
Tell me about this demon dog.

<br/>  
Chloe, you can always stay here with us.
<br/>  
This place is amazing, Monte.
<br/>  
But there's someone at home who's
probably worried and missing me...
<br/>  
and I miss him.
<br/>  
Your corazón?
<br/>  
Mi corazón. What does that mean?
<br/>  
My heart.
<br/>  
I never even gave him a chance.
<br/>  
We Chihuahuas come
in many shapes and colors...
<br/>  
but when you look not with your eyes,
but with your soul,
<br/>  
there we're all the same.
<br/>  
Listen... back there with the lions...
<br/>  
...uh... uh... thanks.
<br/>  
But of course. We are Chihuahuas.

Ah! Civilization at last.

- Delgado!
- Just keep paddling!

- That was fun!
- Yeah, you're a real aquatic goddess.

- Delgado, look!
- What?

Is that you? Nice toga.

never get rid of him.

- Come on.
- Now I'll finally get my diamonds.

- you can pick up her scent using this.
- Yeah.
<br/>  
- I can't.
- What?

I make this noble gesture,

Well, adiós, kid.

can take care of things yourself now.

I'll miss you.
<br/>  
Yeah, I'll miss you, too, kid.
But this isn't goodbye.
<br/>  
I'm sure we'll be
seeing each other again.
<br/>  
[sighs]
<br/>  
Don't turn around. Don't turn around.
<br/>  
Maybe you could use
a little extra help on the force.
<br/>  
Where do you think
you are going, officer?
<br/>  
Ready to get back on the job?
<br/>  
[barks]
<br/>  
Officer!
<br/>  
[both bark]
<br/>  
Yeah. Good boy. Good boy.
<br/>  
[Rachel] Chloe! Papi! Let's go home.
<br/>  
We gotta get home before Aunt Viv does.
<br/>  
Hey, come here.
<br/>  
Goodbye, my friends. [speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
- Adiós, amigo.
- [Delgado] Adiós, kid.
<br/>  
Muchas gracias, Delgado.
<br/>  
Thank you, Chloe.
I've never had a friend like you.
<br/>  
Great, she's not home yet.
She'll be here any minute.
<br/>  
- Can you get the bags?
- Yeah, I'll get the bags.
<br/>  
- I'll put her in the tub.
- Go, go, go.
<br/>  
Hurry up!
<br/>  
Come on. We're going to make it.
<br/>  
Oh-oh. Think fast, amigo.
<br/>  
Hi! How are you? Welcome.
<br/>  
- Welcome. Hi.
- What a surprise. Hello.
<br/>  
I took photographs
of the most wonderful gardens.
<br/>  
You're not going to believe.
First, I want to go see Chloe.
<br/>  
- Actually, I need you to see something.
- That's the best you can do?
<br/>  
- Something you're gonna love.
- Should I bite her leg?
<br/>  
By the way, you look exhausted.
You've been working too hard.
<br/>  
Chloe? Chloe.
<br/>  
- Sam, put my bags over there, please?
- Yes.
<br/>  
Chloe? Rachel?
<br/>  
- Hi, Aunt Viv.
- Hi.
<br/>  
- Hi.
- Hi.
<br/>  
Your hair is all wet.
<br/>  
I was in a bath.
<br/>  
- Oh. Where's my Chloe?
- There she is.
<br/>  
Hi, sweetheart.
<br/>  
Hi. Come here.
Hi, sweetheart.
<br/>  
My baby girl. My sweet angel.
<br/>  
I missed you so much. I did.
<br/>  
Yes, I did.
<br/>  
What's that smell? What's that...
<br/>  
[Viv] It's sort of... urban and...
<br/>  
kind of earthy... and it's fabulous.
<br/>  
That's Mexico No. 5.
<br/>  
I can't believe I'm running over
a pond in my best dress.
<br/>  
So does this mean you're no longer a
prissy Beverly Hills Chihuahua?
<br/>  
Beverly Hills, sí. Prissy,
no más.
<br/>  
How do you say "What are you doing
on Friday night" in Spanish?
<br/>  
[both speak Spanish]
<br/>  
Me? Nothing. And you?
<br/>  
- Nada.
- Bueno, let's...
<br/>  
After the way I treated you,
<br/>  
I can't believe you came after me.
<br/>  
How could I not?
<br/>  
[speaks Spanish]
<br/>  
I think I'm... going to cry.
<br/>  
[whimpers]
<br/>  
Oh, Chloe. [laughs]
<br/>  
[chuckles] Papi likes.
<br/>  
[Papi] In case
you were wondering, amigos.
<br/>  
Delgado received the medal of honor for
capturing his archnemesis, El Diablo.
<br/>  
Shortly after entering the pound,
<br/>  
El Diablo was adopted by a rich lady
with a passion for fashion.
<br/>  
Rafa became the official
spokesdog for Minty Mutt.
<br/>  
For that doggy fresh breath
all day long.
<br/>  
Bimini, Sebastian, and Delta
landed a dream spot
<br/>  
on TV's hottest new reality show,
<br/>  
So You Think You Can Prance. Hey!
<br/>  
Chico and Manuel
stowed away to Beverly Hills...
<br/>  
where they learned
a new English word...
<br/>  
..."bling."
<br/>  
This was Chloe and
me on our first date.
<br/>  
And who knows? Maybe there are
a few taquitos in our future.
<br/>  
Let's just say
mi corazón puts the "wow" in...
<br/>  
... Chihuahua!
