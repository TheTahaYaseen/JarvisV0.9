<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Before Rome, before Babylon, before the pyramids, there was Kahndaq.
[Amon's narration is accompanied by a long establishing shot, panning over a prosperous Kahndaq, rich with impressive architecture and forestry quite unusual for its geographic region].
KAHNDAQ, 2600 BC
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> The first self-governing people on Earth, Kahndaq was a center of power and enlightenment. For centuries, they thrived.
[The establishing shot ends abrubtly as we cut to a scene of the kingdom in chaos].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> But then… 
[Soldiers are shown driving away innocent civilians and tearing down national Kahndaqi banners. A dutch angle shot reveals an ascendant tyrant watching the subjugation of the people from his palace's balcony].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> ...came King Ahk-Ton. Using the army to seize power, Ahk-Ton became a tyrant. But he had even darker ambitions. Obsessed with dark magic, Ahk-Ton’s real goal was to forge the Crown of Sabbac.
[The movie wastes no time showing the hypothetical forging of said crown. It is dark, full of evil, and glows in two colors: blue in "standby mode" and red whenever it's used].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> If infused with the powers of the six demons of the ancient world, it would make Ahk-Ton invincible. 
[Another master shot showcases the widespread exploitation of the Kahndaqi people. Forced into labor for Ahk-Ton, they toil daily in mines, their skins grey and pale from all the dust and ash clinging to their sweaty, worn out flesh].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b>To make the crown, he needed Eternium. A rare mineral of magic properties, found only in Kahndaq. So he enslaved his own people… and forced them to dig.
[One of the older slaves, Djau, digs deep into the sand until he comes across a sparkling, blue lump. The much desired mineral, Eternium. Triumphant, he raises his hand with the lump into the sky].
<b>Djau:</b> Eternium.
[He immediately covers his hand and ceases to rejoice, seeing how he's sparked interest. But it is too late. The other slaves surround and encircle him, reaching out their hands towards his Eternium lump, clawing at the precious nugget].
<b>Slaves:</b> Eternium. Eternium.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Kahndaq was teetering on the brink. What they needed…
[A young boy steps into the fray, defending Djau].
<b>Boy:</b> Get off him! Get off him!
[The slaves, intimidated by his forceful commands, do back off and step away from Djau].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> …was a hero.
<b>Boy: [to the slaves]</b> Why are we fighting each other? Remember who our real enemy is! [to Djau] Come with me.
[The boy takes Djau to the royal outpost, where the King's supervisors oversee the mining procedure].
<b>Djau:</b> Look. Eternium.
[He hands the lump over to the supervisor].
<b>Supervisor:</b> Let me see that.
[He raises the clump high into the air and assesses its value. It <i>is</i> Eternium].
<b>Supervisor:</b> The king thanks you.
<b>Boy [defiantly]</b> He’s supposed to reward him.
[The supervisor glances at the "lucky" slave].
<b>Supervisor:</b> Is that right?
[Djau nods while gesturing with his arms in an apologetic manner].
<b>Djau:</b> I want what I’m owed.
[The supervisor gestures at Djau, and they both go to a sharp turbot from which the mines are clearly visible].
<b>Supervisor:</b> You want a reward?
[The boy watches, slightly smiling, hopeful. But the supervisor draws his sword and stabs Djau with it, much to the boy's and other slaves' dismay].
<b>Supervisor:</b> The king thanks you for your service.
[Having said that, he lets go of the poor fella and casts him off the turbot. Djau falls to his death. The boy is so distraught over this, the supervisor rushes towards him with a devilish grin on his face].
<b>Supervisor:</b> You want the king’s reward too?
[An older man comes just in time, taking a stand between the young slave and the supervisor].
<b>Man:</b> No, but my son accepts the king’s mercy.
[He then escorts the boy out of the warden's sight, who is very clearly busy cleaning the dusty Eternium lump now. The father and the son go to another turbot to have a talk].
<b>Man:</b> I won’t always be here to protect you.
<b>Boy:</b> I don’t need protection. I want to be free. If we fight together, we could overthrow the king.
<b>Man:</b> Let someone else be the hero… the graveyards are full of them. Stop dreaming and go back to work.
[He then turns and begins walking away. The son looks at his toiling, suffering compatriots with great compassion].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Someone to hold the hopes of the people. Even when all hope seems lost.
<b>Boy: [turning towards his leaving father]</b> If we had more heroes… then maybe our freedom wouldn’t be a dream!
[He runs to the supervisor, steals the Eternium lump from him, and begins to run up a hill where he could be seen by most slaves].
<b>Boy:</b> Freedom!
[The young slave manages to hold off king's men by throwing some stones at them. He gets to the top of the hill and presents the Eternium lump to the crowd while holding his palms up in the shape of a triangle. The others follow his example and soon the entire mine is full of "triangle hands". The boy smiles, knowing a spark had been ignited].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> King Ahk-Ton knew that this spark could quickly ignite a fire. And so he ordered that it be snuffed out. 
[The narration is accompanied by the visual of guards setting up the boy's execution. As the executioner raises a sword above the revolutionary's back, the youngster does the triangle gesture again and the people follow suit].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> They thought they were getting a martyr. Instead… they got a miracle.
[King Ahk-Ton finally gives the command. The executioner swings his weapon down on the boy, and it is in that moment that the young convict... vanishes completely].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> The Council of Wizards, the magical guardians of the earth…
[The scene cuts to the ancient land of magic - The Rock of Eternity, where the wizards gather to bless the boy with their reward].
<b>Wizard #1:</b> You have been chosen.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> …sought to restore the balance. They empowered him with the gifts of the ancient gods. And turned a boy… into a champion.
<b>Wizard #2:</b> The stamina of Shu!
<b>Wizard #3:</b> The swiftness of Heru!
<b>Wizard #4:</b> The strength of Amon!
<b>Wizard #5:</b> The wisdom of Zehuti!
<b>Wizard #1:</b> The power of Aten!
<b>Wizard #6:</b> The courage of Mehen!
<b>All Wizards:</b> S-H-A-Z-A-M!
[With this shout, the Council transforms the boy into Kahndaq's champion, infused with the stamina of Shu, swiftness of Heru/Horus, strength of Amon, wisdom of Zehuti/Thot, power of Aten/Aton and courage of Mehen.]
[Next, we see King Ahk-Ton's servant running through the palace with the crown of Sabbac, desperate to deliver it to the monarch as fast as possible.]
<b>Ahk-Ton:</b> Hurry. Give it to me!
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> But the crown had already been completed.
<b>Ahk-Ton:</b> Give it to me.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> And when the Champion arrived at the palace to challange him… 
[The Champion indeed does arrive, strong, imposing, brimming with power of determination. In the same moment, Ahk-Ton dons the crown. Its gleam shifts from azure blue to bloody red].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> King Ahk-Ton summoned its demonic power. In the ensuing battle, the palace was destroyed, but the Champion was victorious. The wizards hid the Crown of Sabbac… so that it would never again fall into the hands of man. And the Champion was never heard from again.
[The visuals show a spectacular destruction of the Royal Palace of Kahndaq, brought down by a thousand lightnings. As the dust settles, the image fades to black, only to reveal a modern day landscape].
KAHNDAQ, PRESENT DAY
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Today, Kahndaq is occupied by international mercenaries, the Intergang, the latest in a series of foreign invaders. But legend says, whenever Kahndaq needs him most, the Champion will return to restore freedom to the people. It has been a long, long wait.
[As Amon continues his monologue, we see Intergang's soldiers scouring the capital city, Shiruta, on motorbikes, to the tune of "Bullet with Butterfly Wings". A couple more swings of the camera through the streets more and we finally see Amon in person. He is skateboarding through the rain-soaked streets of Shiruta. He does a slight turn by pushing himself off of a truck and enters the bazaar district. There, multiple Intergang mercenaries are checking people's IDs and documents].
<b>Intergang Mercenary:</b> Show me your papers.
[Cut to a checkpoint consisting of a tollbooth and a couple soldiers checking IDs and pepers
INTERGANG CHECKPOINT Sector 5 – North Shiruta
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> Move it along! Have your documentation ready.
[The next vehicle in line is a vintage-looking camper. A rather large man, the driver shows the papers to the clerk standing next to the car doors].
<b>Driver:</b> It’s all our three documents, yeah? Don’t judge the picture, it’s after my girlfriend broke up with me.
[The clerk then illuminates the driver and his two companions sitting next to him].
<b>Clerk:</b> Open the back. Need a look inside.
[One of the men looks at his palm hidden beneath his jacket. His firearm is ready].
<b>Driver:</b> Yeah, it’s unlocked, man. It’s just a bunch of old TVs. I’m an electrician.
[Amon reaches the checkpoint with "Bullet with Butterfly Wings" still blasting in the background. The commander stops him and throws him off balance, putting him on the ground. From Amon's backpack fall out comics with modern day superheroes].
<b>Commander:</b> Watch where you’re going. You know the drill, back of the line.
<b>Amon Tomaz: [getting back up]</b> Come on, man, you see me every day.
<b>Commander:</b> And every day I tell ya, if it’s got wheels, it’s a vehicle. Back of the line, mate.
<b>Amon Tomaz: [putting the comics back into his backpack]</b> You’re not my mate.
<b>Commander:</b> I’m heartbroken. Now, go on, piss off.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> No, what you are is a neo-imperialist enforcer, from halfway around the world, sent here to steal my country’s natural resources, strip-mine our sacred lands, pollute our water, oppress our heritage, and make us wait in lines all day.
[This rather abrupt tirade infuriates commander, who pulls out a fairly menacing looking baton. The camper's driver bangs the vehicle's plating].
<b>Driver:</b> Hey, boss man. Can I go?
[Amon uses the commander's distracted state and skates past him without prior indentification].
<b>Commander:</b> Hey!
[He returns the papers to the driver with resignation].
<b>Commander:</b> Go on, get out of here.
<b>Driver:</b> Yeah, yeah.
[Just as the camper passes the now lifted tollbooth, the commander looks at his scanner. Apparently, a wanted fugitive Adriana Tomaz is in the vehicle. The scanner clearly shows the word "DETAIN" under her profile].
[Back inside the camper...]
<b>Driver:</b> Adrianna, we’re clear.
[From a closet located in the car's back slides out Adrianna Tomaz, a former history teacher at the University of Kahndaq, now a self-proclaimed freedom fighter].
[The first of the men sitting next to the driver takes voice].
<b>Man #1:</b> Kahndaq isn’t safe for us anymore.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Let’s just move the crown first, and then we can worry about safe.
<b>Man #1:</b> I got Intergang watching my house.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I gave up my job at the university and moved four times. It doesn’t mean I’m gonna abandon my country.
<b>Man #1:</b> I’m just saying, no one stays a step ahead of them forever.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> We can’t wait for things to cool down this time. If I’m right, they’re days away from finding it.
[Suddenly, a loud thud is heard from the back door. The crew turns their heads and is surprised to see... Amon clinging to their camper. Adrianna rolls up the glass of her window to talk to him].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> What are you doing? 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I want to come with you.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You know it’s too dangerous. You shouldn’t have gotten involved.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Come on, I want to help you beat those bastards.
[The second passenger is watching their little-chit chat carefully].
<b>Man #2:</b> Adriana, keep your head down, please.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You want to be a hero, huh?  
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I do, yeah.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Go home, do your homework. Your time will come one day, but not today, son.
[Amon takes this with visible frustration and disappointment].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Go.
<b>Man #2:</b> Go, little man. You did good.
[Amon is visibly let down, but he lets go of the car and stops on the street. Cut to a shot of the camper speeding through Kahndaqi highways, deep into the mountains].
[The first passenger, Samir, who has been sleeping for some time now, wakes up. Through the rear view, he sees Adrianna wearing a necklace with Eternium].
<b>Samir:</b> That would get you a fortune on the black market. Is that real Eternium? Show us a little magic.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It doesn’t work like that, it’s unrefined.
[The other passenger, Ishmael Gregor, is trying to sleep].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> You guys should get some rest.
<b>Samir:</b> I thought Intergang seized all the old relics.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Hey, come on. Stop it.
<b>Samir:</b> I’m just curious how she got it.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> My grandmother gave it to me.
<b>Samir:</b> How did she get it? 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s not a museum piece. It’s a family heirloom, going all the way back to the days when Kahndaq was free.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> You happy now?
<b>Samir:</b> Cool story.
[The driver, Karim, decides to speak his mind as well].
<b>Karim:</b> And all I inherited was a sweater.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> That’s not true. Baba left you his van, and his bald spot.
[Karim decides to use this fact to his advantage and he begins to explains its merits to Samir and Ishmael].
<b>Karim:</b> You know, some women like a bald spot. Curly on the outside, smooth on the inside. You know?
[Samir and Ishmael remain continually unimpressed about this].
[Cut to the camper driving up a mountain. As it ascends on a bumpy road, the camera shows us a truly abhorrent sight: Intergang mines scattered all over, destroying Kahndaq's soil and extracting Eternium for the mercenaries' benefit. The van finally arrives at the right spot. As soon as Karim stops, his companions exit the vehicle and seize their equipment].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Are you sure about this?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> The inscriptions we found are clear. And I’m positive about that translation. There is something inside that mountain.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> What if it really is the crown? Then what? It’s a source of great power. Who gets to keep it?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No one. We hide it again someplace else. Get it out of the country if we have to. It is too dangerous for anyone to have.
[Samir, who's just closed the car's trunk, joins Adrianna and Ishmael, admiring the mountain's immense size].
<b>Samir:</b> This is it?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Not yet.
[The group begins moving towards the mountain. Karim stays inside the van].
<b>Samir:</b> Are you coming? 
<b>Karim:</b> Bad knee. I’ll keep watch.
[He then inserts a music tape into the car's system and drinks some liquid from a bottle through a straw].
[Our brave explorers soon enter the heart of the mountain. They begin investigating its dark passages, with Adrianna leading the march].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> This way. Almost there.
[She begins to read the ancient inscriptions written on the stones out loud].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “Men were given the gift of magic, but their hearts were too easily corrupted.”
[She stops as soon as she hears some suspicious sounds in the distance. Samir gestures at the inscriptions].
<b>Samir:</b> Keep reading.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “The ultimate power was banished from the earth and hidden… here.” Until now.
[The explorers advance through the dark corridors].
<b>Samir:</b> This mountain has kept the Crown of Sabbac safe for 5,000 years. We’re 100 percent, totally, no take-backs certain that we want to move it?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b>We don’t have a choice.
[As they stop by another stone with inscriptions, Adrianna notices one of her companions is missing].
<b>Adrianna:</b> What happened to Ishmael?
<b>Samir:</b> Great. Don’t worry, I’ll find him.
[Cut to Karim sitting inside his van and singing "Baby Come Back" alongside the tape playing. He cuts it short once he hears a scream. A man falls on the ground at the foothills of the mountain. It is Samir. Karim rushes immediately to his wounded comrade].
<b>Karim:</b> Samir? Samir, what happened?
[Samir intends to say something, but he is choking on his own blood].
<b>Karim:</b> What? I can’t hear you! What are you saying?
[A gunshot rings, killing Samir instantly. Karim glances in the distance. From a nearby boulder emerge the Intergang mercenaries].
<b>Intergang Soldier:</b> Don’t move. Unless you want to join your mate.
<b>Intergang Members:</b> Stay where you are!
[Karim immediately understands the situation. He raises his hands in a conciliatory gesture, trying to smile].
<b>Karim:</b> Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Hey…
[Adrianna reads the inscriptions of the stone quietly. A voice behind her reads it out loud].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> “Turn back.”
[Adrianna quickly turns, jumpscared, but it is just Ishmael].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> That’s what it says, no?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Yes. Where is Samir?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Claustrophobic. Needed some air. Is this the way to the crown? 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I think so.
[They advance further down below, until they reach a dark, cave-like room].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s a tomb.
[She reads the inscriptions on the floor].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “Speak not his power, so he may suffer a dreamless sleep for all eternity”. Teth-Adam. The slave who became champion and defeated the king. The legend was true. Kahndaq… really did have a hero once.
<b>Ishmael Gregor: [skeptically]</b> If he was such a hero, why’d they bury him down here?
[They move to an even lower part of the room. It has no roof, but rather a gaping hole that brings light to it. And in the middle of it... hovers the crown of Sabbac].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> The crown.
[Adrianna begins climbing one of two boulders that can get her high enough to reach the crown. She does, and she makes a jump to another one while seizing the object. Ishmael smiles in satisfaction. Adrianna notices an inscription on the crown's surface and pins it to her belt, but once she glances at the room... she sees dozens of Intergang's soldiers everywhere, several holding down Ishmael and Samir].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> It’s over. Now, give me the crown.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Run, Addy! Run!
[He is slapped by the officer as the rest open fire towards Adrianna. She takes cover behind the boulder].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Hold fire! Don’t hit the crown. Get her!
[The soldiers proceed to encircle the boulders in order to capture Adrianna, but she hides too well.
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Go. Move. Circle around.
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Get down.
[He makes Karim fall on his knees, putting a gun to his head].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Say goodbye to your brother! In five… four… three… two… one…
[Adrianna runs around the room and shows up behind the soldiers].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I’m over here!
<b>Karim:</b> One?! You let them get to one?
[The soldiers quickly put Adrianna to her knees and put the crown in a small suitcase. The commanding officer closes in on the kneeling explorer, holding her at gunpoint].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Any last words?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Please tell my son…
[She looks down on the inscriptions on the floor beneath her, glowing in cyan light. She begins reading...]
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b>“Mightiest of mortals… god of gods, Six Immortal Elders by name…”
[The Eternium necklace on her neck rings and shines. The gaps in the inscriptions fill with teal light, forming a quadrangle of sorts].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> What?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “Shazam.”
[As she utters this, the glowing quadrangle is complete. It is immediately struck by a lightning which descends through the hole in the roof. It blows everyone away and turns the floor into glass. On it kneels down a mysterious figure wearing a black robe, cape and hood. Teth-Adam].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Who the hell is that?
[Him and his mates begin approaching the champion].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> You wouldn’t believe me if I told you.
[The soldiers stop in distance, forming a half-circle over Teth-Adam, weapons aimed at him].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Check him out.
[The soldiers definitely do not want to do this].
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Boss say you go... Chief say your turn...
[The third mercenary finally acquiesces. He slowly, but surely, walks up to the mythical figure].
<b>Intergang Soldier:</b> Hey, amigo. Let me see your hands.
[The man seizes him and begins choking him, lifting him up. Electricity surges through his being, reaching the poor guy and killing him. The mercs watch in horror as their mate is fried alive until he's nothing but bones. Once he's done, Teth-Adam breaks his spinal cord and drops his skeleton, letting it crumble into pieces. His fearsome theme, having been played quietly in the background, is now in full, intimidating swing].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Open fire!
[The mercs begin unloading their shotguns and rifles at Teth-Adam. The champion catches the first bullet, while the next ones simply bounce off of him.]
<b>Teth-Adam: [in Kahndaqi]</b> Your magic is weak.
[He rises into the air, bullets ricochetting off of him all the same. Adrianna decides it's the time to flee].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Go. Go.
[Her and Karim turn to leave the chamber. Meanwhile, the hopeless soldiers reload and keep firing at the wizards' chosen one, who is menacingly brimming with power. He then springs into action, taking them out one by one with superhuman strength, speed and occasional lightning strikes. In the amok, one of the soldiers gets hit and drops the suitcase with the crown, which is spotted by Adrianna and Karim].
[As Teth-Adam keeps demolishing his adversaries, their chief, hidden behind a nearby rock, speaks through the comms].
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> We need immediate backup. Send everything you’ve got.
[Ishmael runs to the case without thought, not afraid he might get sniped by Teth-Adam. Adrianna notices him.]
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Ishmael!
[He opens it, but it is empty. A soldier situated on a boulder fires a missile launcher at Teth-Adam, who in turn throws another soldier at the incoming projectile. The subsequent explosion is strong enough to send some rocks from all around the chamber tumbling down. Ishmael pays the price for his greed, becoming the first to be buried beneath the stones].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Ishmael!
[Her shock almost costs her her life. A huge rock appears in the sky, coming down on her any minute. She ducks, spotting it. But so does <i>Teth-Adam.</i> He generates a lightning and directs it at the stone, razing it instantly, and saving Adrianna. It is in this moment, that his theme finally shifts into hero mode].
[He then spares no glance towards the surprised Adrianna, but instead ascends higher to reach the soldiers located in the upper levels of the chamber. He deals with them all too easily, frying them mercilessly with his bolts. Adrianna and Karim finally exit the chamber].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Let’s go!
<b>Karim:</b> This is as fast as I can go.
[Meanwhile, Teth-Adam slightly descends and strikes the wall, as fire and electrical currents burn his way to freedom out].
[The vengeful hero is immediately met by Intergang's helicopters.]
[Below, Karim and Adrianna exit the mountain. Adrianna immediately spots Samir's corpse].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Samir! What happened?!
<b>Karim:</b> What didn’t happen.
[He quickly gets inside his van, as does his sister]
<b>Karim:</b> Samir fell off of a cliff. I had a gun to my head! Ishmael is buried under a mountain!
[They immediately drive off, desperate to get away from the mountain as quick as humanly possible].
<b>Karim:</b> And you summoned some flying magic man! All for what? NOTHING!
[Adrianna proceeds to take the crown of Sabbac out of her backpack].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz: [triumphantly]</b> Not for nothing.
[Meanwhile, the back up for the Intergang has arrived. Teth-Adam observes in silence as dozens of troops and armed vehicles assemble on the ground below him. The helicopters decide to deal the first blow].
<b>Intergang Pilot:</b> Light him up.
[The helicopter fires a missile and smoke and fire blow over. The two pilots spot Teth-Adam next to their helicopter].
<b>Intergang Pilot:</b> Shit! Where the hell did he come from? Rotor out! Go! Go!
<b>2nd Pilot:</b> I can’t maintain altitude!
[Teth-Adam violently pushes their vehicle towards the other helicopter, makes them explode, and then throws the flaming wreck into the ground units of Intergang, which are firing like crazy at him].
[The helicopter then crashes on the ground, blowing up one of the armored trucks. "Paint It Black" begins playing as the movie transitions into slow-motion. Teth-Adam unleashes a sea of lightning into the soldiers trying to snipe him, then he pushes an incoming rotor away from him. He tears through a flying truck and razes another dozen of soldiers. He catches a grenade bullet and inserts it into a nearby soldier's mouth, then performs an expert thunderclap and throws the ground enemies away. A soldier firing from a nearby HMG located on top of a truck is still a nuisance. Teth-Adam redirects an incoming missile at said truck, and another into the tanks firing them missiles. Slow-motion expires and now we get to see the damage be done in real time: the wreck crashing into a vehicle, the rotor shredding a soldier, the missle pulverizing the ones on the truck and another in the tank, and the electricity atomizing everyone else. Then, that one soldier pulls the grenade out of his mouth].
<b>Intergang Soldier:</b> Oh, shit.
[Black Adam epically stares into the distance, as everything in the background explodes].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Stop! Stop the van!
[Adrianna and Karim's camper stops just before Black Adam's face. Their savior slowly walks up to the van as they nervously roll their windows up. Despite their attempts to stay calm, Teth-Adam nonetheless glances at Adrianna with curiosity. Meanwhile, Karim notices one surviving tank in the distance. And on that tank... a soldier loading an Eternium rocket into his launcher. Karim gestures dramatically, trying to warn Teth-Adam].
<b>Karim:</b> Behind you!...
[The soldier fires as Teth-Adam catches the projectile with zero effort].
<b>Karim:</b> Did he just catch a rocket?
[Teth-Adam examines the missile with mild interest as he spots the sign "ETERNIUM" written on its shell. The shell explodes. Karim and Adrianna can't see anything through the smoke for a while, then Teth-Adam's hand violently sticks to their window. It turns out the hero's cape and hood have been incinerated, leaving only the smooth, uniform black suit of form-fitting fabric with a large glowing thunderbolt attached to the chest. Teth-Adam immediately turns and disintegrates the soldier with a quick bolt. He then spots a shimmering blue wound on his side and flies away. Karim and Adrianna watch his departure in silence].
<b>Karim:</b> God willing, we won’t see him again.
[Just as he says this, Teth-Adam violently crashes into the ground. He lays in the crater his made, his Eternium wound acting up. Adrianna and Karim exit the van, watching him. She starts to approaching him, but her brother stops her].
<b>Karim:</b> Wait. Hey. Hey! What are you doing? Don’t touch him, he’s made of lightning.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Good point. You get him, you’re the electrician.
[Karim reacts to this with absolute disbelief].
[Cut to two Intergang soldiers speeding through the airspace on their Eternium flybikes.]
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Raptor team, come in. What’s your status?
[In the chamber, the commanding officer of that unit is coughing and straining. Meanwhile, Ishmael is safe and sound. He takes the comm.]
<b>Intergang Officer:</b> Help me.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> I told you to make it look real, not punch me in the face.
[He then shoots him].
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Raptor team, come in. What is your status?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Status is that everyone is dead.
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Ishmael, is that you? What happened?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> The crown wasn’t the only thing waiting for us down here.
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Do you have it? 
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> No. But I know who does.
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Copy that. We’re en route to your location.
[Him and his buddy enter high speed and rush on their flybikes to the mountain].
[Cut to a room in a mansion. The resident, Carter Hall, also known as the Hawkman, is watching all the footage and recordings left from Teth-Adam's massacre of the Integang].
<b>Intergang Commander [v.o.]:</b> <i>We need immediate backup. Send everything you’ve got.</i>
<b>News Anchors:</b> This rare, magical mineral has been mined for centuries… …reports of an Eternium blast. It is unknown who or why… …has decimated a number of troops. We are waiting on… …an unidentified male. This being is somehow able to harness…
[Suddenly, an incoming video call is accepted. Before Carter's face appears an image of Amanda Waller, the director of the secret A.R.G.U.S. agency, created by the government to handle metahumans].
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> What do you think?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I think this loose cannon needs to be locked down… before innocent people start getting hurt. Oh, and good morning to you, too.
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> Shove it up your ass, Carter. He’s been asleep for 5,000 years. He’ll be disoriented at first. The longer he has to adapt, the harder it will be to take him down.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Wheels up in 30.
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> Who’s on the team?
[Cut to an outside shot of Hall's mansion. To the tune of a trap beat, a girl stops her bike by the entrance and walks up to a pole with a visual scanner for identification].
<b>A.I. Assistant:</b> Welcome. Please state your name for identification.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Hi. I’m Maxine Hunkel. I’m here to see Mr Hall.
<b>A.I Assistant:</b> Confirmed. Welcome, Maxine.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Thanks.
[The gates open up before her and she enters the premises, riding on a bike.]
<b>Carter Hall: [v.o.]</b> Maxine Hunkel, aka Cyclone. Wind manipulation powers, computer skills, smart as hell. Basically a tornado with a 167 IQ.
<b>Amanda Waller: [v.o.]</b> Sounds delightful.
[The scene cuts back to the video call].
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> But please tell me you found someone who can pack a punch.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That’s where Atom Smasher comes in.
[Cut to a young man sitting in a currently moving car. He too is having a video call - with his uncle].
<b>Carter Hall: [v.o]</b> Al Rothstein, nephew to the original Atom Smasher. He inherited his uncle’s powers.
<b>Al Pratt:</b> How’s my suit? Does it fit?
<b>Al Rothstein: [clutching the bag with the suit]</b> No, yeah. It’s perfect. Thank you again for letting me borrow it. You know, I used to watch you all the time as a kid? This is literally the only thing that I’d ever wanted in my…
<b>Al Pratt:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Don’t let anything happen to it. It’s vintage. And don’t let anything happen to you, either. Don’t do anything crazy. You listen to Carter.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I’m gonna make you proud, Uncle Al. I promise.
[He then ends the call. The scene returns to the OG video call.]
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> They seem green.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That’s why I called in Kent.
[The scene cuts to the interior of another car, driving one British wizard and his headgear].
<b>Carter Hall: [v.o.]</b>Кent’s been out of action for a little while, but I can’t do this without him. Takes magic to fight magic and the man’s got nearly god-level powers.
[As Hall's speaking, Kent Nelson, Doctor Fate, puts his palm to his temple, then gently moves it to the seat next to him, revealing his rusty but trusty helmet].
<b>Amanda Waller:</b> It might take a lot than that. Are you sure they can take him?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Waller, you find us a cell that can hold him… we’ll take care of the rest.
<b>Amanda Waller: [sarcastically]</b> Good luck.
[She disconnects. Carter turns and glances at a showcase located near the room's wall. The showcase is holding his armor].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> This is gonna be fun.
[In his car, Kent touches the helmet again, with the same utmost carefulness. This time, however, he sends his thoughts forward, into the future, and he uses the helmet as a conduit to see what may transpire.
The results are far from expected. A series of wild images: Hawkman blocking bolts with shield, rocks breaking, Hawkman charging forward, a teal explosion of energy, flybikes, Hawkman screaming... Kent wakes up with terror in his heart. He then learns with some surprise that he has arrived].
<b>Chauffeur:</b> We’re here, sir.
<b>Kent Nelson: [exiting the car]</b> Oh, right. Was I staring again?
<b>Chauffeur:</b> Only half an hour or so, sir.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Maybe next time, honk the horn.
<b>Chauffeur:</b> Of course, sir.
[ And here we are, HAWKMAN’S ESTATE SAINT ROCH, LOUISIANA].
[In the hangar, Carter's aircraft - The Hawk Cruiser - gets ready. The team is walking towards it].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> So what’s the op?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We’re headed to Kahndaq to apprehend and contain… a Class-A rogue metahuman.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I didn’t bring passport.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> We don’t need passports. We’re the Justice Society.
[The crew enters the jet. It is looking quite expensive and stylish].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Is this entirely made out of Nth metal?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Everyting down to the screws. Completely indestructible. I’ll be in the cockpit if you need me.
[He then departs to pilot the craft].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> It’s pretty cool. [to Kent Nelson] You got any snacks?
[Doctor Fate just sighs slightly with exasperation, turns and proceeds to leave elsewhere].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> It takes a lot of energy to smash atoms.
[Carter starts the engine. Al takes a place near Maxine. She throws him a snack].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Here.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Oh. Thanks. I’m Al, by the way.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Мaxine.
[She starts the analyzing panel of the main cabin. Al eats his snack].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> What do you do?
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Wind. You?
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I grow.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Сool.
[The garden of Hall's mansion folds in on itself as the underground hangar finally lets the Hawk Cruiser fly].
[Cut to Teth-Adam relieving his painful past in dreams. As soon as he sees the blade in memories, he wakes up, blasting an innocent Superman poster with lightning].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Wh-Whoa!
[Teth-Adam looks at him and at his surroundings. It seems Adrianna and Karim have taken him to their apartment in Shiruta. The champion spares a glance at the burning poster].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Don’t worry about that. I can get another one.
[Teth-Adam rises from the bed and looks at his side, covered in bandaids. He begins ripping them off].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> My mom’s not much of a doctor, but you should probably leave th…
[Teth-Adam removes the bandaids and just seals the still present wound with lightning].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Or do that.
[Teth-Adam closes the wound entirely. Amon, meanwhile, closes the door so that his "guest" doesn't get away.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I know you have a lot to catch up on. But, I was thinking we could help each other.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Мove. 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I’m Amon, by the way.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I didn’t ask for your name.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> You’re Teth-Adam, right? Everyone in Kahndaq knows your story.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I said move.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> My mom said you took out a bunch of Intergang soldiers in the desert.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Because they wouldn’t move out of my way.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> So you can really fly and stop bullets, ’cause that’s really crucial to my plan.
[The champion grabs him mid-sentence and moves him out of his way].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> And is it really you stopping the bullets or is it the suit? Wait, what’s your top speed? I’m sure you’re fast, but how fast? Like Flash fast?
[Meanwhile, Teth-Adam looks at himself in the mirror and is shocked to witness his own reflection].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Wait, did you not have mirrors back then? Wow, I guess a lot does change in 5,000 years.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Five thousand years?
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Yeah, that’s how long you were in the tomb. Until my mom woke you up. So you’ve got stopping bullets, check; flying, check;
[Teth-Adam turns away from the mirror, walking up to the room's window].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> ...and lighting thing, that’s a big check.
[Black Adam moves the curtains away and looks outside. Kahndaq is unrecognizable, now all covered in concrete and modern technology].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I don’t know this place.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> This is your home.
[Black Adam spots a statue far away in the distance].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Then my home is gone.
[Adrianna returns to the apartment. She does away with her disguise, seals all the locks shut, enters the living room, unloads her backpack and checks her DVD player stash. Whatever was supposed to be hidden there, has gone missing].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> What happened to the crown?
<b>Karim:</b> Too much?
[Adrianna looks at her brother, who's watching TV and wearing the crown. She scoffs and takes it off his head].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You know it’s cursed with demons, right?
[Karim keeps watching "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" on TV. Meanwhile, Adrianna checks the inscriptions on the crown].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “Life is the… only path to death.”
<b>Karim:</b> No shit.
[In Amon's bedroom, he is reading the Kahndaqi encyclopedia to Teth-Adam].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> “Teth-Adam was a Bronze Age Kahndaqi demi-god.” “He defeated King Ahk-Ton in approximately 2,600 BC.” There. That’s you. See?
[He shows Adam the picture of his statue in Shiruta].
<b>Amon Tomaz;</b> That’s the statue they built of you. And now you’re back. Our country’s been oppressed by one invader… after another over since you left.
[Amon rapidly closes the book and puts it away, putting all of his focus back on Teth-Adam].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> My point is, Kahndaq still isn’t free. We could really use a superhero right about now.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I’m no hero.
[He gets up and glances at the posters of American metahumans on Amon's walls. Amon immediately gets up and stands before him].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> What? Superman, Batman, Aquaman… You’re way more stacked than any of them. And they’re not coming to Kahndaq to save us. But you could stop Intergang all by yourself, just like you did King Ahk-Ton. You’re our only hope.
[Instead, Teth-Adam turns and walks straight through a wall, into the living room, startling Karim and pushing his couch forward a few meters. Adrianna watches in amazement. Teth-Adam's attention turns to the TV, which displays the Mexican standoff. As the fictional gunslingers are about to fire at each other, Teth-Adam generates a bolt, convinced it's happening for real, and fries the TV].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Wizards.
[Amon enters through the hole in his wall and gasps in excitement].
<b>Karim:</b> I can fix it. Don’t worry. [seeing Teth-Adam's stare upon him] I’m not a wizard.
[Teth-Adam shifts his stare to Adrianna, who nods slightly].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Hey, Mom. He’s awake.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I told you not to go in your room.
[Adam turns to her, alarmed by the sound of her voice].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> It was you who spoke. You woke me.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I didn’t have a choice. I’d be dead if it hadn’t worked.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> The men in my tomb, they were your enemies?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Yes.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Then your enemies are vanquished, condemned to the eternal sleep of the damned.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Actually, we still have a lot of enemies that need vanquishing.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Then destroy them.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Intergang have guns and flybikes and Eternium rockets. We have my mom.
[Black Adam switches into the warrior-mentor mode].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Prove your strength. Destroy your enemy and all he cares about. Make him beg for mercy, but deny it until his final breath.
[Amon listens to all of that, fascinated, and once Adam finishes, the boy turns to his mother, grinning, pointing at the champion].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Interesting, okay? I appreciate what you did for me, but I do not want you teaching my son violence.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I understand. [glancing at Karim] You want his father to teach him violence.
[The electrician nearly chokes on whatever he's eating at the moment].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Gross, that’s my brother. 
<b>Karim:</b> That’s my sister.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> His father’s dead. 
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I’m sorry. Who do you want to teach him violence, then?
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Yeah, Mom. Who do you want to teach me violence?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No one. I want a champion to help free Kahndaq from Intergang. Please, help us.
[For reasons known only to him, Teth-Adam instead walks out of the apartment through another door. Adrianna steps out and watches his departure in disappointment].
[But Amon? He doesn't give up. He takes his trusty backpack and skateboard, activates a hidden tunnel in his closet and reaches a ventilation shaft which leads him to the exit at the stairwell. Teth-Adam is floating, slowly descending in the empty space between flights on stairs. Amon immediately begins descending through the flights of stairs, following him].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Wait. Wait! Where are you going? 
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I shouldn’t be here.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> You don’t feel any loyalty to us at all?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Not really, no.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> You’re not seeing the full possibilities here! I don’t know what it was like in ancient times, but having superpowers is kind of a big deal in our world. Maybe clean up your outfit a little bit, get a cape, change your name.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Teth-Adam is a very strong name.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> It’s a little outdated. And you definitely need a catchphrase. Something blackout bad-ass to say, right before you absolutely cook some dude.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I don’t waste words on the dead.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Well, yeah, kind of like that, but more catchy. I was thinking, like, [in a faux deep voice] “Tell them the Man in the Black sent you.”
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Them? 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> You know, gods, demons… Whoever’s waiting for us in the afterlife. And you wear a lot of black, so we should really lean into that.
[He hops on his skateboard, and skates until the next flight of stairs, then exits and descends on foot until the staircase].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> My point is, you could be famous. Magazines, lunch boxes, video games. And the superhero industrial complex is worth a lot of money.
[Teth-Adam stops mid-air, puzzled by Amon's modern slang].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I don’t need a box for my lunch.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Anyone you’ve ever known is dead. 
[Teth-Adam looks at the statue in distance through a window's crating].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> What else are you gonna do?
[Teth-Adam decides to do what he does best - smash. He breaks a wall and exits the apartment complex, hovering above the streets of Kahndaq and startling the citizens. Amon exits the building "manually", now kind of agitated with the champion. He follows him on the skateboard].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Wait! Where are you going?
[Back on the Hawk Cruiser, Kent and Carter are in the cockpit, analyzing the data on Black Adam A.R.G.U.S has acquired].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Waller’s file needs a bit to be desired. Most of this was considered a myth until yesterday afternoon.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> He’s a bad man, Kent. What else do you need to know?
[The Doctor sits down].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> When you’ve seen as many different futures as I have, you cease to believe in absolutes.
[Carter snickers].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> What are you laughing at?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I’m not laughing. That was a smirk.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I know. That’s how you laugh.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I’ve missed having you around to spout old cryptic shit like that.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Almost as much as I’ve missed having you around to ignore all my advice. Carter... [He takes out a box with mint pills] This is not a very good plan.
[Hawkman leans on the cockpit's display panel, which is showing Black Adam's immense power].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Yeah, well… A bad plan is better than no plan at all.
<b>Kent Nelson: [sucking his mint pill]</b> If only there were a third option.
[Cut to the main cabin. The Helmet of Fate rings resoundingly on the table as Al tries to grab it. Maxine, who is walking nearby, warns him].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> I wouldn’t touch that if I was you.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Why not?
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> ‘Cause that helmet is from another planet. It’s millions of years old.
[Al moves his hand away from the helmet].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> It chooses who it lets touch it.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Like Kent? 
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Yeah. Like, Kent is leterally possessed when he puts it on.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> What happens if I touch it anyway?
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Soul crushing terror? Or… something.
[Al sits down, resigned].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> So we should probably put a towel on it, right?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Coming up on it. Ready stations in five.
[As Carter enters the frame, Maxine puts her book away while Al decides to ask a question].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Hey, why is this Adam dude so pissed off?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> He’s not some dude. He’s a weapon of mass destruction.
[Maxine raises her hand].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You don’t have to raise your hand.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Question: if he’s so powerful, how are we supposed to stop him?
[That one is answered by the incoming Kent].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> If we can get him to say the word, “Shazam,” Teth-Adam will lose his power. And we’re hoping since he’s had a few thousand years to sleep it off, we can peacefully negotiate the terms of his existence.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> From the footage you showed us, he doesn’t really seem like a “peacefully negotiate” kind of guy.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Correct.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Look alive. We’re here.
[Him and Kent turn to the display panel, which reads "ENTERING KAHNDAQI AIRSPACE"].
[Meanwhile in Shiruta, Amon still follows Teth-Adam as the entire city watches its champion in wonder. The hero ascends and flies to the statue. The flashes of his past play out before his eyes].
<b>Teth-Adam [to the statue, in Kahndaqi]:</b> Forgive me.
[Amon decides to put Black Adam out of his marasm. He glances at a nearby Intergang checkpoint, which has the same Commander dude from before. Amon skates forward and steals his shortwave, eliciting a "Hey!" and getting himself chased].
<b>Amon Tomaz: [through the shortwave]</b> This is a message for all Intergang soldiers! Kahndaq has its own official superhero now.
[Chased by the Intergang members, he swerves and turns in the direction of the bazaar. He does some impressive turns, then drops the shortwave in a nearby cauldron full of dumplings. He walks up a flight of stairs and stands on a bench, raising his hands and folding them into a traingle - the Teth-Adam gesture].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Тeth-Adam!
[The hero is still staring at the monument].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Please.
[The Intergang Commander finally spots him and rushes to him, pushing the civilians in his way away].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> There he is! Move!
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Тeth-Adam! 
[The champion notices].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> Move!
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Тeth-Adam!…
[He gets tackled off the bench by the Commander and pinned to the ground. The brutish merc lifts him up and lets him stand up. Another soldier joins him].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> Get up! Who’s gonna save you now, mate?
[Amon points upwards, at the statue. Teth-Adam is gone].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> The statue?
[Amon shakes his head as if the dude were an idiot. The man swings his fist, but gets stopped by someone else. Adrianna, wrapped in robes so nobody recognizes her, steps in].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> That’s my son. He’s just a boy. He doesn’t know what he’s doing. [To Amon, with fake frustration] What are you doing?
[Amon joins her, but the man already knows what's going on. He pulls Adrianna's hood down. It's over].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> Hang on. I recognize you.
[The visual display on his wrist matches Adrianna].
<b>Intergang Commander:</b> Where is the crown?
[Instead of answering, Adrianna picks up Amon's skateboard, and whacks the Commander with it, pushing him into his mate].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Let’s go!
[Her and Amon begin running, but another soldier shows up and stops them, then the rest takes them from behind. Teth-Adam finally shows up - also from behind - and presents himself to the third soldier. The soldier whacks his baton on his head. Teth-Adam is not amused. When the guy takes another swing, he throws the soldier to the skies, who screams and falls elsewhere, probably dying].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> You could’ve showed up a bit sooner. But that was dope.
[The Intergangs let them go. Mother and son go hide somewhere, while the soldiers focus all their fire power on Teth-Adam. He stops their gunfire with just his hand].
<b>Intergang Soldier [in a corner]:</b> We need backup down here.
[The ammo runs out. The movie then proceeds to portray a parody of "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, with Teth-Adam and the Intergangers all over the square trying to draw their "guns" faster. Teth-Adam is naturally the fastest. Once the Intergang Commander even touches his holster, Teth-Adam blasts him, then blasts everyone else with lightning in a second's fraction. Amon and Adrianna emerge from the corner].
<b>Teth-Adam: [proud]</b> Tell them the Man in Black sent you.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Well, yes, but not to me. Say it to the bad guys. But before you zap them.
<b>Teth-Adam: [understanding]</b> Catchphrase, then kill. 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Yes.
[Gunfire from a distant turret tower follows, nudging Black Adam barely. He proceeds to speed-blitz the object and grab the shooters, flying higher with them in his hands].
[On the Hawk Cruiser, a sudden surge of energy, passes through the helmet, waking Kent up from what seemed to be a deep trance. He spots something outside the window].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> He’s here.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> You sense his presence?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> No. I assume he’s the only person in Kahndaq that can do that.
[He shows his team Teth-Adam hovering in the air some meters away from them, two Intergang soldiers in his hands].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Fate and I’ll take the lead.
[He gets up from his seat].
<b>Carter Hall: [to Al and Maxine]</b> Listen. Now, you two hang back ’til we call you. We’re the anvil, you’re the hammer. You’re ready.
[Teth-Adam proceeds to drop his "hostages"].
<b>Al Rothstein: [pointing]</b> He just dropped the, um…
[Teth-Adam smiles cheekily].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Shit.
[He proceeds to immediately exit the plane in order to save the falling bandits].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Be prepared.
[He puts his helmet on and disappears with a loud clang. Al and Maxine are left alone on the jet].
[Carter manages to reach and catch both falling mercenaries. One of them, thinking it was Teth-Adam at first, warns his comrade:]
<b>Intergang Soldier:</b> Behind you!
[Carter activates his armor and wings and manages to lift himself and the men up before they're squashed by an approaching roof. They all fly up, and then go down. Carter drops them on the street. The Kahndaqi citizens are not happy with that. They start booing at Hawkman and his Western interventionism].
<b>Kahndaqi Citizens:</b> Let us be! Let us be!
[Carter tries to deescalate].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I don’t know their crimes, but whatever they are, these men should face due process.
[The mercenaries behind his back rise and begin running away. Before they can get far, a lightning bolt reaches and kills them just as Carter turns to see it. The Kahndaqi citizens are happy with this gruesome development, cheering as soon as the corpses hit the ground].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Then let the gods make their judgment.
[The champion enters the frame, descending slowly from above, majestically, until he's some feet above Carter].
<b>Kahndaqi Citizens:</b> Yeah! Yeeeeah!
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You don’t look like an Intergang.
[Hall begins his speech, turning his head from Black Adam to the citizens and vice versa, making sure his words apply to everyone gathered].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We’re the Justice Society. Our mission is to protect global stability. We’re here to restore peace to Kahndaq. And we will use force if necessary.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Force is always necessary.
[A loud, booming voice from above addresses the champion directly].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Teth-Adam.
[Doctor Fate slides into the frame seamlessly, his levitation seeming even more majestic and grand than the champion's. His golden helmet, gauntlets and ornaments gleam, reflecting the sun's rays, complemented by a form-fitting one piece blue uniform].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> We know who you are and what you are capable of. There’s no place for you in the world of man. You have two choices: kneel or die.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I was a slave until I died. Then I was reborn a god. I kneel before no one.
[The tension between the three metahumans is almost tangible. Finally, Teth-Adam makes the first move. He blasts his lightning at Fate, who barely shields himself with magic, and then at Hawkman, who blocks the currents with his shield].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Fate, give me a distraction!
[Still holding the electricity with magic, Kent spins a spell, transforming the environment. Everything shimmers and changes, the modern landscape giving place to... ancient Kahndaq, just like it used to be before Ahk-Ton. Everything including Kent vanishes. Teth-Adam is left alone, floating, pondering his confusing surrounding. A shape appears in the sky, heading at him. Teth-Adam takes no notice, thinking it's a bird. But no! It's Hawkman, who rams into Adam with full force, punching him out of the air. The champion hits the streets, bounces off of them and hits a building. Carter smoothly lands, while the hero of Kahndaq rises from the debris, mad].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Just say, “Shazam.” We all go home.
[He whips out his mace].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I don’t have a home.
[Hall jumps at him with his mace, but Black Adam anticipates this and simply grabs the mallet by its hilt, holding it and its owner in place. Then, he simply blasts Hawkman into a car and blasts him some more before tackling him upwards. The two metahumans soar into the skies again, kicking, punching each other, trading blows.]
[Back at the Hawk Cruiser, Atom Smasher and Cyclone have finished changing into their superhero suits. Al whistles in admiration of Maxine's green attire].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Wow! Look at that suit. It’s cool.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Thanks. You, too.
<b>Al Rothstein: [stretching in his blue and red one-piece]</b> Thank you. It was a hand-me-down. It was from my uncle.
[They observe the outside skirmish through the windows].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Hawkman just does not give up, does he? 
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Nope.
[The fight continues. Adam hurls a massive bolt towards Carter. He catches it with his mallet, then redirects it at the Kahndaqian. Adam staggers, then gets punched down by Carter. He lands in some sort of a construction site. Amon immediately goes there].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Amon, where are you going? Wait!
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> To help him!
[Amon descends down layers of stone and sand, only to find Adam emerge from a hole. The champion of Kahndaq looks across the bricks, sand and construction bars till he spots Doctor Fate hovering above].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Cyclone, Smasher, now is your time.
[Maxine activates the ramp and exits the plane in a dancing fashion].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Let’s roll!
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> What are you doing? Hey. Hey-hey-hey!
[Maxine activates her powers, unleashing winds and swimming down the air to the construction site, surrounded by green haze. She creates a crazy vortex of wind, which rips the construction bars off scaffoldings. Cyclone throws this storm of metal and dust at Black Adam. The pieces either miss him or bounce off of him, but Adrianna and Amon have to take cover. The second wave is more precise. Bars hurled by Maxine effectively stab the ground around Teth-Adam, trapping him in a sea of metal poles. Al drops off the Hawk Cruiser, letting the autopilot take over. He lands and slides on a rooftop, before barely stopping himself from falling by grabbing a nearby antenna. Down below he sees Teth-Adam freeing himself. Lightning erupts as Adrianna and Amon try to get out of the site. Amon slips on a stair and begins falling].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No!
[The still hovering Kent reacts in time, teleporting Adrianna and Amon before they're hit by the ricochetting poles. They're now on a square. Al proceeds to take his mask on].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I’ll be right there!
[At the square, as Adrianna and Amon recover, Doctor Fate senses something inside the boy's bag. He touches it and gasps, sensing the might of the demons flowing from inside. He takes his helmet off, and addresses the two civilians].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> You have the Crown of Sabbac.
[He notices Carter and Adam clashing again, puts his helmet back on and rejoins the fray. Adrianna and Amon run elsewhere. Carter punches Adam into the construction side again, but before the champion can stand, Kent creates a fractal shape and brings it down on Adam, causing him immense pain, as evidenced by the champion's screams. The fractals soon disappear as Nelson puts forward a set of his half-tangible clones, his mini soldiers. They begin grappling and wrestling with Teth-Adam. He breaks the duplicates without much effort, but they soon overwhelm him and pin him down, while one of them puts him in a real chokehold NELSON, as ordered by Kent, controlling his doppelgangers from above].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I can’t hold him much longer.
[Carter lifts a random car and flings it at Adam as a means of distraction].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Move! [Him and Adrianna rush to the exact location].
[The champion notices the projectile and manages to free his left hand from Fate's semi-corporeal copies, aiming it at the car and evaporating it with lightning. Carter immediately swings into action, bringing his mallet down on Teth-Adam, as Maxine sends forward another wave of bars. Amon and Adrianna arrive. The punch is nearly here. As the mace and the bars close in on him, Teth-Adam's eyes light up in blue as the air hums and buzzes].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I’m coming! I’m zeroing in on your location!
[The explosion shows him he's been running in a completely wrong direction. He groans and turns into the right direction. Meanwhile, Kent and Carter are sent flying, crashing into buildings by the force of the blast. Maxine sits on the ground, knocked down, as Teth-Adam rises, brimming with power. He focuses on her in a menacing way, but thankfully, Al, who's grown to the point of a dinosaur now, swoops in and punches Adam down, pinning him under his fist. The dust slowly settles. Some of the citizens nearly get hurt by the flying debris].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I got him! Guys, I got him.
[He then helps Maxine up].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> It’s me, Al. In case you didn’t recognize me.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> There’s something different about you. Can’t quite put my finger on it.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> You know, it’s probably because I’m six stories tall now. But you… You’re like a tornado.
[Kent appears next to them, still in uniform, but now without helmet].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I thought the two of you did great work. First time out… Bravo.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Thanks. I mean, I got a little turned around back there, but, it all worked out, right?
[Carter joins the team, flying].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You’re damn right it did. Let’s hope Waller has that cell ready for him.
[The ground shakes as nearby TV screen black out. Lightning appears from under Atom Smasher's fist. Teth-Adam is charging up].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> You want me to keep my hand here, right?
<b>Carter Hall [readying his mallet]:</b> You’d better not let him up.
[Kent is with his helmet on in the air too, preparing his magic to strike any second].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Uh... What do I- What do I do? Guys?!
[The force from below finally knocks his palm upwards. Black Adam launches rapidly, hitting Atom Smasher with an uppercut worthy of Civil War Iron Man. The young superhero falls down, shattering a nearby statue in the process].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Woo-hoo!
[Carter lands on the ground as one citizen cowers in fear of him and ducks behind his car. But the crowds rejoice. They hail Teth-Adam's name in enthusiasm].
<b>Kahndaqi Citizens:</b> Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion!
[The loudest of them is a man called Rami].
<b>Rami:</b> Long live the Champion!
[Maxine immediately checks Al's life functions. She feels his strong breath].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Yeah, he’s definitely still breathing.
[Carter nods and looks at Adam. Adam looks at the crowds, still calling his name].
<b>Kahndaqi Citizens:</b> Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion!
[He then looks down... and storms off, flying to the old ruined royal palace, confusing everyone.]
[The gathering ends. Kent, in his normal attire, begins walking away].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Where are you going? We need to go after him.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> We’re not strong enough.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Oh, well, maybe next time use your powers of prediction to figure that out before we get our asses kicked.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I’m working on it!
[He rushes to Adrianna, stopping her under a building].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Miss? Excuse me, you mind if I look in your bag?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Yes, I do mind.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Where are you going with this, Kent?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> She’s got the Crown of Sabbac.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> One catastrophe at a time. We can’t give him a chance to regroup.
[Maxine joins the group].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> He’s been spotted entering the palace. It's safe to say he’s not going there to surrender.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Why do you want Teth-Adam to surrender? He’s the Champion of Kahndaq. Who are you? [mockingly] The Justice Society? We have been living under military occupation for 27 years, and never seen you before. You didn’t come when Intergang invaded our country, when they stole our resources and killed my husband. But now, we finally have our own hero… and you decide to fly down here and save us? Thank you, but… we’re covered. Go and protect inernational stability someplace else. Oh, and second, I don’t have the crown.
[Carter walks up to her in an intimidating manner].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Let me spell it out for you. Teth-Adam can’t be Kahndaq’s champion because he is not a hero.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Tell that… [she gestures around the people in the vicinity] to all the people he just liberated.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I know what this looks like. I do. But I can assure you that my t…
[Al rises suddenly, knocking over another monument and destroying it].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I am so sorry. Was that expensive?
[Carter gestures at him angrily]
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Me and you. When we get back to the ship…
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Yes, sir. 
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Me and you. [He turns to Adrianna] I… Can we please just see the crown?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I don’t have it.
[Cue Amon skateboarding vigorously back to his apartment located in a nearby block of flats, the crown being most likely located inside <i>his</i> backpack].
[Back at the plaza, Adrianna takes the backpack from Hawkman's grasp].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We don’t have time for this. Teth-Adam first, then the crown.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You don’t have any authority here. Teth-Adam has done nothing…
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Teth-Adam is not who you think he is.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> And how would you know?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We have access to ancient texts that have been kept secret for centuries.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz: [in disbelief]</b> And what exactly do these supposed ancient texts say?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> They say that his rage nearly destroyed Kahndaq.
[This very clearly startles Adrianna and instills doubt in her].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> And we flew all the way over here to stop it from happening again.
[Cut to a shot of Kahndaq's main plaza. Adrianna and the JSA members pass the roundabout and stop near the entrance to the ruined royal palace. We see some reconstruction work has already begun, judging from several scaffoldings set up all over the vicinity].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You want to go in there alone? Are you sure?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You want to go in and fight Teth-Adam again, be my guest. But if you actually want to resolve things peacefully, without destroying the rest of my city, I’m your only shot.
[Teth-Adam is floating above the throne room, staring vacantly into the statue of the champion several miles away. Adrianna arives, alone].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You brought the invaders with you.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> They only want to talk.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> They can talk. I won’t listen.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> When I was a little girl, my grandmother told me the story… of how the Champion came to this exact spot… to free the enslaved people of Kahndaq by defeating King Ahk-Ton in battle. But according to the Justice Society, that’s not really what happened. They say that you didn’t come here to seek justice.
[Flash back to the scene of Ahk-Ton's defeat. The servant is running at full speed through the throne room with the crown of Sabbac].
<b>Ahk-Ton:</b> Hurry. Give it to me!
[Just as the servant is about to reach the throne, a teal lightning catches him from behind and pulverizes him nearly instantly].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> That you came to exact revenge.
[The crown, unsupported by any lifting agent, falls out of the king's reach, and bouncing off of the stairs leading to the throne, it finally rests on the floor as the vengeful Teth-Adam enters the palace].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> And in your anger…
[Teth-Adam ascends, floating in the air as his corporeal form begins generating excessive amounts of electricity. Thunderbolts and ozone fill the entire throne room as the "hero's" eyes ignite in a wild gleam. King Ahk-Ton begins to panic].
<b>Ahk-Ton:</b> Don’t kill me. I can give you anything you want!
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> This is what I want.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> …your power grew until it became uncontrollable.
[The air, crackling with voltage and intensity, turns into one giant whirpool of power that engulfs everything around it and explodes abruptly, vaporizing the palace and everyone in it.]
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> And the Council of Wizards was forced to deem you unworthy… of the gifts that you were granted.
[The scene shifts into the meeting of the Council in the Rock of Eternity. Teth-Adam is standing, surrounded by them, now caped and hooded].
<b>Wizard #1:</b> We have chosen recklessly… and humanity has paid the price. And now, Teth-Adam… you must pay.
[A battle ensues in which Teth-Adam vanquishes all the adversaries but the Leader, Shazam. He surrounds Adam with a cocoon of dark red energy, screams and seals the false champion's particles inside the temple's stones. The prison is later sealed inside Kahndaqi mountains. The scene finally fully returns to the present].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It wasn’t your tomb that I opened, was it? It was your prison. And now there’s a statue of you. Out of the hope that someday Kahndaq’s champion would return. But it’s built on a lie, isn’t it?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I never said I was a hero. I never claimed to be anything.
[Adrianna walks up closer to him. His vacant stare finally focuses].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You may not have been a hero. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t be one now.
[Teth-Adam finally makes the decision].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I will hear them out. But if they choose to fight, they choose to die.
[Back in the apartment, Karim is making some tea. Amon runs through the door, excited.]
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Uncle Karim! I can’t believe you’re sitting around watching TV… when the most epic day ever is…
[He freezes once he notices a lack of Karim in the living room. Suddenly, he hears a familiar voice calling him].
<b>Voice:</b> In here, little man.
[Amon runs to the kitchen... and sees Ishmael, alive and well, sitting at the table. Karim is making tea].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Ishmael. My mom said you got buried in the tomb.
<b>Karim:</b> Funny story, he didn’t.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Where’s Adrianna?
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> She’s back at the square… 
<b>Karim:</b> We should go bail her out right now.
[Amon notices a strange nervousness in his uncle's speech and mannerisms].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> But she’s the one who sent me home to make sure the crown’s safe.
<b>Karim; [even more nervously]</b> It is safe, okay? Somewhere else. Definitely not here. Let… Okay…
[Ishmael rises abruptly from his chair, gun pointed at Amon and Karim].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Put the bag down. 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> What are you doing?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Back away. Put the bag down, now.
[Karim backs away as Amon puts the bag down].
<b>Karim:</b> Give him the bag. Give him the bag.
[Amon tosses the bag towars Ishmael].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Very good. Back away.
[Amon backs off into the corner. Ishmael points the gun at Karim, who seems to be approaching].
<b>Ishamel Gregor:</b> Back away. 
[Karim backs away].
<b>Karim:</b> – Oké. I’m…
[Ishmael reaches down to the bag, and checks its inside. The crown is there, glowing blue. Ishmael glances at Amon reasurringly].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> It’s all going to be okay, little man. Let me teach you some history that you’ve never learned… in one of your mother’s classes. [He straigthens up and looks Amon with a serious expression in his eyes] When we had a powerful king, Kahndaq used to be something much better than free. It used to be great.
<b>Karim:</b> Run, Amon, RUN!
[Karim rams straight into Ishmael and tackles him. Amon grabs the bagpack and runs away. In the skirmsh, Ishmael shoots Karim. Amon barely manages to escape Ishmael through his secret closet exit to the stairwell].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Crash the building. I lost the kid. He has the crown.
[The Justice Society of America finally reaches the throne room and joins Adrianna. They stop some meters away from Teth-Adam. Al makes a little wave, eating from a bucket of chicken nuggets from the Kahndaqi Fried Chicken. Kent magics the chicken box away and shakes his head at Al, letting him know it's distasteful].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We’re here to negotiate the terms of your peaceful surrender.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I’m not peaceful. Nor do I surrender.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> What have your powers ever given to you? Nothing but heartache.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You have no idea.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Then why are you making this hard on us? We both know you’re not supposed to be here.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> It is you who is not supposed to be here. I want you all to leave Kahndaq and never return.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Gladly, with you as our prisoner.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> How ’bout I rip your little wings off instead?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I’d like to see you try. 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Okay, more fighting won’t solve this.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I disagree. 
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Me, too.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Looks like we found common ground.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> This can only end one way.
[Adam smirks in return, knowing his enemies have done away with all the pretenses].
[Adrianna's phone buzzes and she picks it up. It's Amon].
<b>Amon Tomaz: [v.o.]</b> Мom? 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Amon.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I got home and Ishmael was in the kitchen.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Ishmael’s dead.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> No, he shot Uncle Karim, and he’s after the crown.
[Amon is hiding in the ventilation shaft leading to the stairwell as forces of Intergang search the building].
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Ground forces…
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I’m hiding in our building, and Intergang’s here. They’re coming.
[He quickly disconnects as a couple soldiers walk next to the ventilation shaft. In the palace, Adrianna approaches Teth-Adam].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Intergang are after my son.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> They don’t want him, they want the Crown of Sabbac.
[Adrianna ignores him and continues to plead with Adam].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I know you’re not a hero. But you’re not a monster, either. I don’t care what anyone says. You saved me in that cave. You didn’t know me and your first instinct was to save me. I’m begging you. Please, save my son.
[Teth-Adam measures this decision against all other possible choices - and concludes it's the right thing to do. He storms off to find and save Amon].
[In the building, the Intergang soldiers are sweeping the entire stairwell, going higher and higher].
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Check the whole place clean. Cover all access points. Keep looking!
[The search moves up and up and Amon is finally able to exit the shaft without being noticed immediately. Still, he keeps his head down while skating, so as not to have it be out in the open].
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Area’s clear.
[Unfortunately, Ishmael's also there, and he spots Amon by accident. He points at him, calling his comrades].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> There! There! Take him! Take him!
[Compromised, Amon drops the facade and begins running].
<b>Intergang Soldiers:</b> Right there, right there!
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Move, move! Don’t shoot him, I need him!
[What follows is a wild chase with Amon using anything he can to stave off his pursuers - laundry lines, carts, objects].
[The chase continues until a flybike enters the building and grabs Amon].
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> End of the road, kid.
[He begins flying up with him. Unfortunately for the pilot, Teth-Adam is already waiting at the top].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Release the child.
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Whatever you say!
[He drops Amon immediately down the stairwell. Adam dives down instantly and stops Amon mid-fall.]
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Yes! Thank you!
[Adam puts Amon down on a story].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> But maybe be more careful with your word choice next time.
[Adam nods and flies up, massacring the Intergang soldiers at the top. Soon, the upper levels of the stairwell fill with smoke and ozone].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Оh! And remember your catchphrase!
[Ishmael suddenly springs outta nowhere and puts his gun to Amon's side].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Time to go, Amon.
[They exit the building. Ishmael searches Amon and his things, looking for the crown, but to no avail. He looks at the boy, exasperated and puzzled].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Where’s the crown? 
<b>Amon Tomaz: [feigning ignorance]</b> What crown?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> You want to be brave, eh? 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I want you to go to hell.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> That’s the plan, little man. We’re gonna go for a ride. Come on.
[He takes him to his Intergang flybike. Adam exits the building with that one biker still in his hand, and notices Amon's things lying in the corner. He then sees a flybike speed through a nearby street. Adam takes chase, with the biker still in his hand].
<b>Intergang Biker:</b> Put me down! Put me down!
[Teth-Adam drops him to his death].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You should really be more careful with your word choice next time. And tell them that the Man in Black…
[The man dies upon impact with the ground before the catchphrase is finished. Teth-Adam just straightens his head, disappointed, and continues the pursuit of Ishmael and Amon].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> He’s right behind me. Where the hell is everybody?!
[Teth-Adam appears next to him, and Ishmael proceeds to do a space jump with his bike, as if "teleporting", then appearing behind the confused Adam, who resumes chase. A couple of turns and swerves and a cordon of other bikes joins Ishmael, making it impossible to decipher who's who].
[Locked in Ishmael bike's trunk, Amon calls Adrianna. She answers the phone and has just exited the palace].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Mom?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Amon, where are you?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No, no, no, what?
[She hears something so unbelieveable she demands her son repeat it].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b>I’m in one of their bikes.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> What bikes?
[The music, playing in a chase tune, now switches to a glorious fanfare as Teth-Adam catches up to the dramatically maneuvering bikers. He blasts a signboard down on their heads. One biker avoids it through a space jump, but Adam intercepts him, rips off his trunk, and lets him go once Amon is found NOT to be there. The vehicle and the pilot crash into the wall of the KQI Bank, above Adrianna's head, on the roundabout].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> AMON!!!
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Can you hear me? Mom, I’m okay.
[It turns out Amon was indeed NOT in that bike].
[The rest of the bikes are meanwhile met by the Justice Society. The Hawk Cruiser deploys Hawkman].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Shit.
[Him and most of the bikers turn away, one fails to do so. Carter intercepts him and stands on his vehicle's surface].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Activate infrared.
[Infrared tells him Amon's not there. Teth-Adam suddenly swoops in, punches Carter off the vehicle and searches the thing himself, ripping its trunk off].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> What are you doing?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Searching for the child.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> No, you’re murdering people.
[The pilot opens fire at Teth-Adam, which he completely ignores].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> How else do I find the child?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I can help you, but no more extrajudicial killings.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I don’t need any help.
[He smashes the vehicle and speeds forward. Hall barely manages to catch the pilot].
<b>Carter Hall: [through the comms]</b> Smasher, Cyclone. What are you waiting for?
[On the jet, Maxine lowers the ramp].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Come on, let’s go!
[Al looks down the streets of Kahndaq, unsure].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Okay. Okay. I got this. On the count of three. One, two… This feels a LOT higher than last time... WHOOOAAA!
[Maxine finally pushes him down the ramp. Al begins falling and enlarging at the same time].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Ah! That was not cool!
[The bikers go through a tunnel as Al lands on their street. He stops the vehicles that could ram straight into him].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Whoa, slow down.
[The first biker sees Al and opens fire. Atom Smasher covers himself and the people down below with his hands, his uniform taking the bullets].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I got you! I got you.
[Maxine springs into action and startles the firing biker, then sends his vehicle into disarray, even temporarily stopping the engine. But the dude restarts the vehicle and barely manages to speed past Al's enormous palm, who, trying to grab him, almost hits the incoming Teth-Adam. The "champion doesn't even care and continues flying].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Hey, careful, dude. I almost hit you!
[Saying that, he raises his hands in a "c'mon, man!" gesture and ends up hitting the incoming Hawkman instead. Hall lands heavily on the ground].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I am so sorry. I don’t really have peripheral vision in the mask. It’s my uncle’s. I’ll get it tailored.
[Carter rises angrily, gesturing at Al].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Me and you.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Roger that.
[The chase between Teth-Adam and the two bikers continues. Now they've exited the land and are racing above the sea. Adam lets one biker think he's given up, then rams into him with full force from the side. Once the 2nd biker sees this, he accelerates. Teth-Adam rips the 1st one's vehicle trunk and finds it's empty. Again. Then he hurls the pilot into the sky and proceeds to have the fly bike perform a space jump. The vehicle rams into its pilot, killing him and exploding while Teth-Adam swerves and resumes chase after the last escapee].
[In the Tomaz apartment, Kent Nelson appears and removes his magician attire. He walks to the wounded Karim].
<b>Karim:</b> Who are you? 
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Call me Dr. Fate.
<b>Karim:</b> How bad is it, Doc? Am I dying?
[Fate quickly assesses the sufferer's condition].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I’m not that kind of doctor. But don’t worry, I can see the future. This isn’t how you’re going to die.
<b>Karim:</b> How do I die, then?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Just stay away from electricity.
<b>Karim:</b> Wait, what? I’m an electrician. How the hell am I supposed to do that?!
[Kent puts him to sleep with magic and wonders how to teleport him safely into the jet].
[The chase of the biker has entered its final stage. Now him and Adam are somewhere in Asian mountains. The fugitive panickingly presses his space jump button again and again, overheating the vehicle. Him and Teth-Adam are now travelling at hypersonic speeds, everything around them being but a uniformic blur of colors. The metahuman grasps the vehicle, kills the engine and after a brief struggle brings it down, crashing on a random rice plantation. Teth-Adam makes for a natural brake, making sure the vehicle is left relatively unharmed. Two Chinese planters see the aftermath and walk closer in curiosity. Meanwhile, Teth-Adam reaches the wreck - the pilot crawling away in desperation - and opens its truck. Amon's not there. No, Ishmael apparently landed somewhere in the street back in Shiruta and loaded his flybike on a truck - which he has now opened. In Asia, Teth-Adam throws the vehicle away in frustration. In the truck, Amon opens his eyes].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Oh, God.
[Ishmael takes off his helmet].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> The Champion’s coming for you. You know that, right?
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> I’m counting on it.
[He then pulls the truck's blinds together as it speeds on a Kahndaqi highway].
[Back in Asia, the Intergang pilot, now helmetless, running, bumps straight into Teth-Adam].
<b>Intergang Pilot:</b> Please don’t.
[Adam swats him away into the sky. A holographic image of Doctor Fate appears before the Kahndaqian's eyes].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Teth-Adam. Where are you?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You followed me?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> My mind and body can exist in different places at the same time. Did you find the boy?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Caught one of the bikes, but he didn’t have the child.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Bring me the prisoner. I’ll break his mind.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Uh...
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> You killed him, didn’t you?
[The aforementioned pilot finally falls to his death, screaming, and crashes with a loud thud. Teth-Adam turns to Fate, his expression faking guilt].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> He didn’t make it.
[Cut to the interior of the Hawk Cruiser. Karim is apparently stitched up, and resting].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> The bullet’s extracted. The tissue damage has been repaired. Blood pressure, 120 over 81. Heart rate’s at 74 bpm. He’ll be back on his feet in no time.
<b>Al Rothstein: [with admiration]</b> That is insane.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> The nanobots did most of the work.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> No, no, no. I’m not gonna let you downplay this. I literally just witnessed a miracle.
[Maxine snickers].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> What? I say something stupid?
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> No, it’s just that you can transform your molecular structure, grow a hundred times your own size. You’re an impossibility and the world still amazes you. I don’t know, it’s… It’s cool.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Thank you. But it’s not as cool as nanobots. That’s how you do your wind thing.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Well, the wind thing is called aerokinesis. And the nanobots were injected into my bloodstream… by this really messed-up scientist who kidnapped me when I was 15.
[Al is really taken aback by this].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I’m… so sorry.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> No, you’re good.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> It seems like you really turned it around. Found your calling. Hoping this is mine.
[Cut to Adrianna silently crying in Amon's bedroom. Suddenly, she hears a voice].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> There’s no point in dwelling in the past. It’s already moved on from you.
[She looks through the hole in the wall and notices Doctor Fate sitting in an armchair in the living room. She rises and moves to that room].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Why did you say that?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> You were blaming yourself for trusting Ishmael. Your thoughts are beter spent on the things you can change, not those you can’t.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz: [almost whispering]</b> You see the future? Tell me how I get my son back.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> By trusting us. Karim will live. We will save Amon. It’s what we do.
[Just as he finishes speaking, a huge amount of force and pressure causes the flat's walls to break open and shatter. It is of course, Teth-Adam].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I suppose they didn’t have doors in your day.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Well, of course we did. That’s how we entered rooms.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> What I did there is called sarcasm.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Where’s Amon? Did you find him?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Not yet, but I will. The men who took him will suffer.
[Through the hole swoops down Hawkman, dropping two intergang members on the floor].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Maybe these guys can help. There’s an upside to keeping prisoners. [Looking at Black Adam accusingly] They can answer our questions.
[Adrianna immediately takes that to her heart. She goes absolutely ballistic on the mercenaries, kicking and punching them with surprising viciousness].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> What did you do with my son?!
[Carter looks at Teth-Adam, who then slightly nods and walks ove to Adrianna, stopping her hand].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Adrianna. Adrianna. I’ve learned that in this modern world, we shouldn’t hurt our prisoners. We should treat them with dignity, respect.
[Hearing this, Carter turns to Kent and looks at him with a smug expression. The British wizard opens his slightly closed eyes].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Let’s start with just one simple question. Can either of you fly?
[They do not get it at first, but it would've been too late anyway. The "champion" of Kahndaq tackles them and takes off, soaring into the sky.]
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Shit.
[He immediately takes flight and follows them].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I think I’ll sit this one out.
[Meanwhile, in the Kahndaqian airspace, a raging storm has unraveled thanks to Teth-Adam's powers. Amongst nearly pitch black clouds and teal, flashing lightning bolts Carter appears over Black Adam's shoulders. The "champion" is still holding the captives].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Tell me what you did with Amon.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You’d better not drop those prisoners.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I’m not going to drop them. [He then looks menacingly at them both] I’m going to drop one of them. Whoever answers first lives. Where is he?
[The prisoner in his right hand shakes his head sadly].
<b>Prisoner #1:</b> I don’t know.
[Teth-Adam immediately releases him. Carter dives down after him without a single word. Meanwhile, the menacing metahuman turns his head to the merc in his left hand...]
<b>Prisoner #2:</b> He’s at our mine in the desert. I can show…
[His words turn to screaming as Teth-Adam drops him as well. Carter grabs the first dude while noticing the second one falling down several meters away from him. He quickly turns and flies in his direction].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Oh, you gotta be kidding me.
[Black Adam, pissed but technically satisfied, returns to the flat. Kent is not sitting anymore, awaiting him with concern in his eyes].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> You said you wouldn’t hurt the prisoners.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> That was sarcasm.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> No, technically, it was just a lie.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Intergang have a mine in the desert. Amon is there. 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I know it. It’s near the Al Hadidiyah Mountains. Let’s go.
[Carter descends and lands, dropping the two captives on the floor again].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I told you! Stop killing people!
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> They look alive to me.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Because I saved them.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Well, that’s why I waited until you were there. I got the information I needed, no one died. I did it your way.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> He does have a point.
[Hawkman ignores these words and takes two steps towards his Kahndaqian rival].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I know it got lost in all the confusing, but we still have some issues to settle here.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> We know where Amon is. We have to go.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> There’s no “we” here. There are only heroes and there are villains.
[This strikes a nerve in Teth-Adam. He starts approaching Hawkman].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You think yourself a hero, but you would let these criminals go free, knowing that many more will suffer at their hands unless we end them now.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Heroes don’t kill people.
[The tension in the room is palpable. Standing face to face, the two rival seem to be willing to start fighting any time now].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Well, I do.
[Carter's patience has officially expired. He whips out his mace without the slightest warning].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Here we go.
[The two start trading blows. Kent teleports back into the armchair. The first round concludes with Black Adam epically smashing Hawkman into a cupboard].
[Carter rises dramatically and readies his mace again. Doctor Fate inserts a mint pill into his mouth, without a care in the world. Hawkman uses his left wing to fling a chair into Teth-Adam, who doesn't flinch even slightly. Then, the JSA leader charges head first at the slave champion, his mace forward. Adam blitzes and appears behind the American, grabbing his right toe. He then smashes him into a wall leading to Amon's bedroom. The brawl switches to that place. Adam gets the upper hand, crashing Hall into another cupboard. Carter proceeds to deal a few comically unsuccessful blows while his razor-shap wing quills massacre a nearby Flash poster. He then gets pinned to another wall and tries to whack his mace into his foe's face. Black Adam anticipates this and slams the mace into an Aquaman poster on the wall instead, which instantly caves in. Carter obstructs Teth-Adam's next punch with his shield and takes the mace out of the poster wall, ripping out a few concrete chunks. His wings tear apart subsquent posters and shatter a mirror. Amon's action figures get thrown into the air. A lightning gets blocked by the wings. Another few blows (one of which has Adam's fist punch through the room doors) and finally Adam punches a cupboard instead of Carter. His fist ends up hitting a rather unusual object. On Adam's fist appear blue glowmarks]. 
[Carter checks the damaged object and spots a glowing crown pinned to its inner strip].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Is that what I think it is?
[Back on the JSA ship, the group, Teth-Adam and Adrianna are running a chemical analysis of the crown].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> 23 pounds of pure Eternium, much denser than typical artifacts of the period.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> King must have had a really strong neck.
<b>Teth-Adam: [annoyed]</b> No, it snapped when I killed him.
[Cyclone suddenly catches something on the crown's surface].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> What’s that? There’s writing on the inside of the rim.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> “Life is the only path to death.”
[The group turns to the woman, who's sitting down with her palms crossed at her chin. She then rises].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> That’s what it says.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Life is the only path to death. Well, that’s surprisingly obvious. Could it have another meaning?
[Atom Smasher decides to speak up].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> What if it means, like… “Life is short. You gotta hold on to what you love.”
[Maxine looks at him, confused. Al then looks at Hawkman, who's quite clearly agitated].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Stop.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Deep.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> It doesn’t matter what it means. It should be buried under the ocean for eternity.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That’s not far from what we had in mind for you when this is over.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Or I could bury you with it.
[Meanwhile, Adrianna takes the crown out of the analyzing panel]
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> We can’t get rid of it now. It’s the one thing that Intergang wants. Believe me, I know more than anyone what this crown is capable of. But we have to keep it until my son is safe.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Adrianna… Trust me, we will get your son back.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> They don’t care about him. They just want to defeat me.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Hand it over. We can’t risk letting this crown fall into the wrong hands. We will find another way.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No. You like to split the world into good and bad, but that’s easy to do when you’re the one drawing the line. All I care about is Amon. And until he is safe, we’re all on the same side. And you… [she gestures at both Carter and Adam] you will work together.
[Carter sighs with resignation].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Set a course for the Al Hadidiyah Mountains. We’ll go in at dawn. [To Teth-Adam] I hope you can be a team player.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I love teams.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> That was sarcasm again, yes?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Very much so.
[Doctor Fate nods in visible relief].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Good. Just checking.
[Cut to the Hawk Cruiser dashing through the night sky as "Is This The End?" plays in a background suspensefully. Kent, dressed in a bath robe, enters the cockpit and joins Carter].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> A wise man once told me a bad plan is better than no plan at all.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That was before we had a very bad plan.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Let it go. I’d rather be fighting with him than against him.
[He takes place by Carter's side].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> He’s a murderer, Kent. If he turns on us, that kid is as good as dead.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> You don’t get to decide who lives or dies. That’s… up to Fate.
[This piques Hawkman's interest and suspicion. He looks at Fate questioningly].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> What’s the helmet telling you? Somebody’s gonna die. Who is it, Atom Smasher? It’s Atom Smasher.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Surprisingly, no.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Is it me?
[Kent tries his best to stay composed and jovial, but the shreds of his visions flash before his eyes... His collected persona starts showing cracks].
<b>Kent Nelson: [with effort]</b> When it’s time for you and I to say goodbye, you’ll know. All I can tell you is… There is still time to change the future. Let’s <i>use</i> it.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Well, I guess we’re sticking with a very bad plan.
[Him and Kent turn to watch the surveillance cameras. The image shows Teth-Adam pacing impatiently around the main cabin].
[As we cut to Ishmael's truck entering a complex set of buildings and machinery, the title card lets us know we've arrived at the AL HADIDIYAH MINE. INTERGANG CONTROLLED OPERATION].
<b>Carter Hall: [v.o.]</b> The Al Hadidiyah mine is Intergang’s most valued asset.
[Cut to the Hawk Cruiser's main cabin. Carter is going through every step of the plan, showing it on a visual display map].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I’m gonna land us right here, cut off their access to reinforcements. But the perimeter of the mine creates a natural fortress. There is only one way in, one way out. We’ll be an easy target for their flybike patrol. Communication is key. We keep in step or we get outflanked.
[Each member of the team listens attently. Adrianna, Maxine, Kent, Al, even Teth-Adam].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We move through the mine, inch by inch, until we find Amon. [To Teth-Adam] This is where you come in. Are you ready… Damn it.
[Turns out, Teth-Adam has ALREADY come in. In this very moment, Kanye West's "POWER" begins blasting in the background. The visual display shows Adam approaching the mine with full power. The Intergang members are caught off guard, and despite all their efforts, are crushed by Teth-Adam's solitary assault, as the chorus of "POWER" is still blasting in the background].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Or we could just do that.
[Carter proceeds to give him a vicious sideye].
[Adam uses a large Intergang aircraft to penetrate the outer sheathing of the mine. He then spots a group of people protected by some kind of energy barrier, and rams into it, only to be repelled and thrown to the ground].
[Ishmael, Amon and several Intergang mercenaries are on a mini mining platform in front of Adam. "POWER" fades, giving way to the Intergang theme, now more prominent than ever before in the movie].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Pure Eternium shield. Unbreakable, even with your powers.
[Not stopped by anyone, the Justice Society enters the frame together with Adrianna soon after. The woman is wielding a captured Intergang rifle].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Amon.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You hurt him, I will kill all of you.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Nobody has to die. We just want the crown.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We don’t have it.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Believe me, nothing good will come from that crown.
[Ishmael aims his guns at Amon's temple].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> No crown, no negotiation.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I have it.
[She frantically drops the rifle and puts the crown out of her son's backpack].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s right here. Release my son, you can have it.
[She steps towards the platform, but is stopped by Carter].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> What do you think you’re doing?
[Adrianna speaks, but instead of looking at Hall, she stares at Black Adam with pleading in her eyes].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Intergang killed my husband. I’m not letting them take my son, too.
[A common understanding between Adrianna and Adam is felt. The "champion" blitzes forward, blocking Carter. Adrianna rushes to the platform, but Kent intervenes and plants crystal barriers on the Eternium force field. Adam shatters them with lightning].
<b>Teth-Adam: [to the JSA]</b> Not your son. Not your country.
[Ishmael deactivates the power barrier, letting Adrianna access the platform]
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Not your decision to make.
[Carter flies up with determination. Ishmael points the gun at Amon again, stopping both Hawkman and Adrianna in their tracks].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> <i>Stop</i> there!
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s okay. Nothing is gonna happen to you.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Hand it over, now.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> I’m sorry, Mom.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No.
[Teth-Adam too propels himself in the air, watching as Adrianna hands Ishmael the crown].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Now, let Amon go.
[Ishmael watches the crown with satisfaction and perhaps even... <i>nostalgia?</i>]
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> I thank you. And I thank your friends for returning this crown to its rightful owner. [To Teth-Adam] What kind of Champion of Kahndaq sides with foreign invaders?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> You have what you want. Let him go.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Ishmael, what are you doing?
[The man is still staring at Teth-Adam, as if he did something terrible to him].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Taking back what’s mine. I’m the last living descendant of King Ahk-Ton the Great.
[A quick visual flash of Ahk-Ton confirms this].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> And you have just given me everything I need to become the next… king of Kahndaq.
[Teth-Adam and Adrianna react to this revelation with confusion, shock and anger].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> My family passed the knowledge on, you know, one to the next.
[Suddenly, he starts getting emotional, as if the crown was an old family legacy... <i>Oh, wait...</i>]
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> The crown, crafted by our ancestors, stolen by the wizards and hidden away. But still a source of great power, if only we can wield it.
[Teth-Adam is getting visibly infuriated with the man's monologue. Ishmael cackles, as if he just heard something absolutely hilarious].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> They say when Hurut died, you wept like a baby.
[The mention of that person causes noticeable surprise in Carter. Meanwhile, Teth-Adam's self-control is just barely present, rage brimming from every cell of his being].
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> I wonder if you’ll do the same for them.
[He directs his gun at Amon's temple one final time].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Please, Ishmael.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> Sorry, Amon.
[An Intergang mercenary to Adrianna's right points his gun at her as well].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Fate, get ready.
<b>Ishmael Gregor: [in Kahndaqi]</b> Death is the only path to life.
[His right hand, wielding both the crown and the force field remote control presses the button on the latter. The barrier instantly disappears. Music rises to an alarming rhytm as both Teth-Adam and Hawkman charge at the platform, the latter roaring. The movie switches to slow-motion. Before any of the heroes can even get close to the platform, Ishmael fires. Teth-Adam accelerates and throws himself in the direction of the bullet].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> AMON!!!
[The bullet is travelling towards the boy's head with terrifying speed. Teth-Adam barely manages to place his right palm between Amon and it, vaporizing the projectile, as the music hits a low, bass note. With no one being able to do anything, the metahuman's rage explodes. His body lights up in a thousand bolts as the air gets heavier and thicker. Sabbac's theme starts playing as the place begins to resemble King Ahk-Ton's palace when Teth-Adam detonated himself in there more and more... Carter jumps behind Adrianna, concealing her under his Nth metal wings. Doctor Fate wraps Amon in a cocoon of protective energy, as Al grows and covers Maxine with his big hands. Ishmael dons the crown, surrounded by dozens of thunderbolts. His soldiers die, pierced by raging electrical currents. Teth-Adam raves, utterly incapable of restraining himself. In one, big, powerful blast, the Al Haddiyah mine explodes, giving way to a huge column of grey smoke combined with pulses of teal and blue light that flicker for a bit after the explosion. When the dust settles, and the air clears enough, the mine is nothing but a ruined jumble of cinder, debris and rubble. Carter unfolds his wings, freeing Adrianna. She spots Kent carrying her son in his arms. The boy is unconscious].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Amon!
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> He’s alive. But we need to get him to the medical bay.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Where is he shot? 
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> It wasn’t a bullet.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> It was me.
[The movie, as if it were agreeing with him, plays "It Was Him", a sorrowful, suspenseful tune. Adrianna looks at Adam with despair, who then looks at the ground in shame].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Come.
[Him and Adrianna teleport into the jet. Carter turns to Adam, but the "champion" launches into the sky.]
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> We’re going with you.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Just find the crown. Get it on the cruiser.
[Carter flies up too, and sets out to find Adam. Meanwhile, Al proceeds to throw some pieces of debris away and locates the object, shrinking to his normal size].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b>I found the crown. But it’s not alone.
[The camera pans into a large piece of cored metal to reveal Al's discovery. The skeleton of Ishmael Gregor is grasping the crown, holding it to its chest. The skull's expression is a gruesome cry of pain].
[Carter lands in the half-reconstructed royal palace in Shiruta, with Teth-Adam brooding next to the throne elevation. Carter walks up to him a bit].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> How long we gonna keep doing this?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> There’s no point in fighting. We both know no one can stop me.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You’re right. Only you can. Ishmael said you cried when Hurut died. Who’s Hurut?
[Teth-Adam, with his back still turned on Carter, begins the tale].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Hurut was the true Champion of Kahndaq.
[The final series of flashback begins. First, we learn that the young boy, the freedom fighter from the beginning, is in fact Hurut].
<b>Teth-Adam:[v.o.]</b> And he was also… my son.
[That is right. The man who stopped that supervisor from punishing Hurut after Djau's death, is in fact Teth-Adam. His face, earlier obscured, is now visible. The flashback switches to a replay of their conversation].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I won’t always be here to protect you.
<b>Hurut:</b> I don’t need protection. I want to be free.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Freedom is for the birds. Let someone else be the hero… the graveyards are full of them.
[We are now back at Hurut's failed execution attempt. Teth-Adam is seen breaking through the royal guards, attempting to reach his son at the executing podium].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> I tried to protect him. But I wasn’t strong enough.
[Despite his efforts, Teth-Adam is finally stopped and held in place by the guards. Meanwhile, Hurut raises his hands in the revolutionary triangle gesture, and just like before, he vanishes upon being struck by the executioner's blade. At the Rock of Eternity, he's given the powers of the gods].
<b>Wizards:</b> Shazam!
[Hurut is hit by lightning and made champion].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> The wizards decided that he would be their champion.
[The scene shifts to Ahk-Ton's thugs burning Teth-Adam's home].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> But after the Champion’s many victories, the king went after what Hurut loved the most.
[The guards take Teth-Adam's beloved wife, Shiruta (the capital of Kahndaq would later be named after her) and kill her as the man screams in pain and torment].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> Our family.
[Teth-Adam is also struck with a sword. He wakes up some time later, as Hurut enters his razed house].
<b>Hurut:</b> Hold on, Father. Stay with me.
[He leans over the dying Teth-Adam and holds his hands]
<b>Hurut:</b> With my powers… you’ll be safe.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I couldn’t protect your mother.
<b>Hurut:</b> Repeat what I say. Shazam. 
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Shazam.
[Lightning strikes twice as power shifts from the son to the father. Teth-Adam is healed, reborn, bestowed with the wizards' powers. His son... the one who saved him, is now back to normal... a young boy, no older than Amon is now].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> Instead of battling the king… instead of saving Kahndaq… Hurut chose to save… me.
[Seeing his father alive and well, Hurut smiles. But his smile fades as an arrow pierces his chest. He falls down, and more arrows start flying inside the hut. King Ahk-Ton's archers are sending them. Teth-Adam quickly grabs his son and vaporizes the projectiles with electricity from his palm, and then looks at it].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> But he couldn’t save himself from the king’s assassins.
[Teth-Adam takes his son in his hands, calling out to him, begging him to keep living, but it's no use].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> The powers were not a gift from the wizards… but a curse.
[His despair turns into rage. Teth-Adam screams and rises, launching himself into the sky. His body covers itself with the Champion's uniform, as a storm brews around him, mirroring the rampant hatred inside his heart. And that's how Teth-Adam became Black Adam].
<b>Teth-Adam: [v.o.]</b> Born out of rage.
[The scene permanently returns to the present].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> The statue of the Champion isn’t you. It’s Hurut.
<b>Teth-Adam: [sorrowfully]</b> My son dreamt of a better world. That’s why he saved me. But the world was only a better place with him in it.
[He turns to Carter and stops levitating. He begins to walk down the throne stairs].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Kahndaq needed a hero. Instead, it got me.
[Genuine shame and regret can be heard in his voice].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> All this power… And the only thing I can do with it is hurt people. I will speak the word my son gave me, and I will give up my power. And when I do, you must ensure I never speak it again.
[Teth-Adam finally stops before Carter, both knowing what's about to happen].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Shazam.
[Carter closes his eyes as lightning strikes Teth-Adam, returning him to his Kahndaqi form].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Some men are not meant… to be heroes.
[For the first time, Carter Hall looks at him with compassion. "It Was Him" masterfully transitions into "Lake Baikal" as the scene cuts to a frozen location, namely a TASK FORCE X BLACK SITE SECRET LOCATION, which, ironically, is located in Antarctica, and not Russia, as the score would have you believe. The Hawk Cruiser approaches the icy lakes slowly. Hawkman and Doctor Fate are piloting in the cockpit, with Teth-Adam stripped to a bed, sedated and comatose. Carter proceeds to detach the cockpit from the rest of the plane and keeps descending. On the actual jet, Amon wakes up and sees his mom].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Hey.
[Carter dives down into the icy lake. Kent is amazed to see its contents].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> So beautiful.
[Carter ignites the front lights and steers the cockpit-jet to the Task Force's prison docking port. The vehicle passes an invisible barrier and stops. To Carter and Kent's meeting comes Emilia Harcourt of A.R.G.U.S and her subordinates].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Surprised to see us?
<b>Emilia Harcourt:</b> Surprise is a dirty word in this business.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Are you sure you can handle him?
<b>Emilia Harcourt:</b> You’re the one who can see the future, you’ll tell me if we can’t.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Just be careful with this one.
[The A.R.G.U.S guards take Teth-Adam, stripped to his bed and take him away].
<b>Emilia Harcourt:</b> You know, they say the gods created us, but we’re the ones who always wind up burying them. Waller sends her regards.
[She leaves to join her team, as Hall and Nelson return to their cockpit-jet].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b> They’ll know how to deal with him. To keep him from regaining his powers, they’ll keep him in suspended animation.
[The guards drag Teth-Adam into a bacta-tank, put a breathing apparatus and cuffs on him and lock him inside his cell].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b> As long as he’s submerged, he won’t be able to speak. He’ll never say another word again.
[The camera pans out, to reveal dozens of metahumans locked in their own cells alongside Teth-Adam. The cockpit jet leaves the lake prison and connects with the main aircraft. Amon observes the icy landscape through a window].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Hey! There he is.
[Him and Maxine approach Amon, with Al holding a piece of fabric].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Not all heroes wear capes, but I think you earned this.
[He gives Amon a hand-made superhero cape].
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Well, statistically, most heroes don’t wear capes. But yeah, try it on.
[Amon dons it, and is fascinated with it, he poses with it against a mirror].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Yeah, looks pretty good.
[Maxine throws a little wind, so that Amon's cape flutters].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> That’s a nice touch.
[Amon does a Superman flying gesture in the mirror and looks pretty impressed with himself].
[Cut to Hawk Cruiser's cargo bay, as the camera pans to Ishmael's corpse, vacuum-packed in a plastic bag. It starts wheezing and whirring, and then the lights inside the cargo bay die. Meanwhile, the corpse begins to glow red].
[Doctor Fate's helmet senses this and sends Kent another horrifying version of the future. Kent gasps and begins groaning. Carter spots this and turns to him].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Kent. Kent!
[The Doctor awakens abruptly].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Mission accomplished?
<b>Kent Nelson: [terrified]</b> My vision hasn’t changed.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> But Teth-Adam’s out of the equation. Kent, if this isn’t over, I need to know what’s coming. What is the helmet telling you?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> My vision has always shown me great calamity.The world in flames. We can stop it… but you die.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You should’ve told me sooner. I have no fear of death.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> That’s precisely why I didn’t tell you. The world needs the Justice Society. The world needs you.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> But you can’t choose who lives and dies. That’s Fate, right?
<b>Kent Nelson: [chuckling]</b> Well, that sounds familiar. I remember seeing my first airplane.
[He leaves his helmet on a table and walks up to Carter].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> It was an RAF deployment, headed to the Western Front. Everyone on my street came out to see them off. But I didn’t cheer. Even though I was only a boy.  knew where they were headed, and what awaited them. Thanks to this, [about the Helmet] I’ve lived longer than I could’ve ever have hoped for. I have seen the world change in more ways than I could’ve imagined. I’m still a sentimental fool. And I don’t want my friend to die.
[He pats Hawkman on the arm, then departs elsewhere].
[In the main cabin, Adrianna and Maxine are tinkering with the crown].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Ishmael said, “Death is the only path to life.” But that’s not what the inscription says.
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> Right. “Life is the only way to death.” Maybe he got it backwards, like he read it in a mirror or something.
[Adrianna is hit by a realization].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> That’s it. In Kahndaqi mythology, the souls of the damned are sent to the Rock of Finality. The underworld is a mirror to our own. Here, turn the crown around.
[Maxine does so].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Now mirror the letters.
[Upon doing so, it all lines up].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> See? That’s what I missed. “Death... is the only path to life.”
[The inscription matches. As soon as Adrianna says this, Ishmael's skeleton ignites. The soul of Gregor appears in the underworld].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz: [v.o.]</b> He kidnapped Amon on purpose, because he knew that Teth-Adam would kill him. And he believed the Champion’s magic would send him to the Rock of Finality.
[Ishmael is presented with the mightiest demons of the Underworld - Aym, Belial, Asmodeus, Belzeebub, Crateis, and of course, Satan].
<b>Belial:</b> As life is the path to death.
<b>Aym:</b> Now your death is a path to life.
<b>Asmodeus:</b> The wizards have their champion, now we have ours.
<b>Belzeebub:</b> You will take the throne of Kahndaq… and unleash hell on Earth.
<b>Satan:</b> Speak our name.
<b>Ishmael Gregor:</b> “Sabbac.”
[Ishmael screams as his soul is consumed by flames and merged with the crown, which evaporates, and together they emerge from the waters of Shiruta. Ishmael Gregor is reborn as Sabbac].
[The Hawk Cruiser's sensors go crazy].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> What the bloody hell is that?
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Readout says it’s the demon, Sabbac.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Get me closer. Now, right now!
<b>Carter Hall:</b> We’re 100 miles out, give me 20 seconds.
[He accelerates and the jet begins approaching Shiruta with enormous velocity. The group looks at the GPS display in anticipation. Sabbac, meanwhile, is hovering over the city].
<b>Sabbac:</b> The king has returned. The throne will be mine.
[The jet appears outta nowhere as Carter aims and fires at Sabbac from its turrets].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Brace yourselves.
[Sabbac roars and unleashes fire on the aircraft].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Hold on!
[Nth metal withstands it, but the demon grabs the plane, startling Atom Smasher, and rips the cockpit off of the rest, hurling it into the city. The jet crashes into the waters, while Carter narrowly manages to crash-land the cockpit into the city].
<b>Sabbac:</b> Now prepare to die.
[He unleashes fire on everyone - who's gotten out of the plane. Kent appears and shields them with fractals. Adrianna and Amon run elsewhere].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Wait, wait, where’s Uncle Karim?
[Maxine joins Kent and she redirects the fire blowing from Sabbac back at him, startling him. Carter activates his armor and wings].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> No matter what happens, he does not sit on that throne.
[Al, who's grown back to the large size, rips out a large pole].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Copy that. 
<b>Maxine Hunkel:</b> We’re on it.
[The Justice Society springs into action].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Heads up!
[He throws the pole straight at Sabbac, knocking him off balance and ending his fiery rampage. Hawkman swoops in next, hitting the unbalanced beast with his mallet. Sabbac falls down and sloppily lands on the ground, Carter doing so more gracefully a mile or so away. The two charge at each other and start trading blows, locked in one another's grasp. Sabbac headbutts Hawkman and ends the lock, then a couple more blows and he tackles the winged hero to the surface. Carter frees himself in time and slides away, the quills of his wings easing the path. Then he swings his mace and transforms it into an axe. Cyclone comes in with another gust of wind, throwing a car straight into Sabbac's face, hurling him away. Then, another blow lifts Atom Smasher in the air. Roaring, Al enlarges and hits Sabbac with his knee, beating him down again. The Demon Champion rises and vanishes into fire before Carter can cut him in half with his axe].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Activate infrared.
[The infrared sensors show Al and Maxine be toppled by non-corporeal streams of fire].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Sabbac, show yourself!
[The self-proclaimed ruler of Kahndaq finally materializes, pouring pure heat at Carter. Hall shields himself with the wings, barely withstanding the full power of Hell].
[Camera cuts to Karim searching for his relatives in the crowd of fleeing civilians].
<b>Karim:</b> Adrianna! Amon!
[A quick cut shows Adrianna and Amon running in the same crowd, but farther from Karim].
[At the battlefield, Carter finally manages to puncture Sabbac with his axe].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That’s for my cruiser.
[He thrusts the weapon further into the demon's flesh, and lifts him. However, Sabbac breathes heat at Hall as a means of distraction. He then punches him away with a mighty blow. His wound heals in no time. Before Hawkman can properly recover, Sabbac throws him straight into a building. Carter flies through it, reaches the roundabout leading to the palace, hits the pavement and loses consciousness].
[A static shot reveals Sabbac slowly flying to the palace as Doctor Fate stands amidst the flaming city and removes his helmet. Hawkman finally recovers, gets up and looks at his old friend].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> This is it. We can’t win, Carter.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Yeah, but the world burns if we don’t. Right? Bad plan is better than no plan at all.
[Slightly hobbling, Hawkman starts to stride towards the palace's gate. Atom Smasher and Cyclone join him. Watching his companions in dismay and fear, Doctor Fate finally makes the choice. As they're walking on the steps leading to the gates, they bump into a force field. Kent materialized behind the field, levitating].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> No, no, no. What are you doing?
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Giving us a third option.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> It’s supposed to be me.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I didn’t tell you my whole vision, old friend. I did see your death. But I also found a way to prevent it.
[Carter desperately tries to force the field into deactivation by pressing it desperately].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> It has been an extraordinary life, but always with one foot in the future.
[His tone gets more and more emotional with each word].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Carter, for the first time in 100 years,when I look ahead… I see nothing.
[Hawkman looks as if he's about to cry].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> No, Kent.
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> And… it’s… beautiful.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Wait, Kent!
[He starts hitting the field with his mace, putting all his strength into it].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Goodbye…
<b>Carter Hall: [still hitting the barrier]</b> Kent!
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> …my dear friend.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Kent! [to Al and Maxine] Hit it from every side.
[Nelson dons his helmet and flies to face Sabbac. Smasher and Cyclone go to different points of the field to break it. Hawkman is still trying to destroy the barrier with the mace. Fruitlessly].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Kent! Noooo!
[As his theme plays in the most menacing way yet, Sabbac finally enters the palace's throne room. But not one step towards the throne does he make, he is hit by Doctor Fate's crystalline sword, just like Teth-Adam was one day ago].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> I am Dr. Fate, sorcerer, agent of the Lords of Order, defender against darkness and chaos, but even my powers cannot defeat you.
[As Kent is speaking, dozens of his partially organic, partially magical copies materialize around Sabbac and lunge at him, kicking and punching him all at once. Initially overwhelmed, The Demon Champion eventually regains his footing and begins to handle the Fate clones pretty easily].
<b>Sabbac [tackling a clone]</b> There’s no one that can defeat me!
[The clones keep coming at him, and through them Kent speaks, his voice multiplied and amplified].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> There is one... There is… THERE IS ONE.
[The camera zooms into the real Doctor's helmet, and here we see Kent's face, from a HUD display point of view].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Teth-Adam. I know you can hear me.
[His consciousness reaches far, far away, to Teth-Adam's, who is sealed deep within his cell in Antarctica].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b>The battle your son was meant to fight is upon us. Now you are the only one who can defeat The Demon Champion.
[Teth-Adam responds as his eyes open. Before them appears a non-corporeal avatar of Doctor Fate. Kent uses it to perform a spell].
[As the "Dr. Fate" track in the background seamlessly flows into "Prison Break", the capsule opens, water leaking out of it. Teth-Adam falls out of his cage, his cuffs broken by the Doctor's magic. As soon as Adam reaches the ground, he immediately rises and tries to remove his oxygen mask. The A.R.G.U.S guards reach him in no time and hold him, punching him with their batons. Adam's eyes open even wider].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b> You have the power to be the destroyer of this world.
[In Shiruta, dozens of Fate clones battle Sabbac as Kent continues to speak to Adam].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> But you can also be its savior.
[Adam finally fully awakens and counterattacks. He bends one of the guards in a way that his mate hits HIM with the baton. Then, Teth-Adam frees himself from the rest and punches them all away with two quick blows and a kick. He takes another one out by a baton throw and the next one is used by him as a human shield against the other guards' bullets. As he deals with subsequent A.R.G.U.S members, Kent continues to guide and motivate him].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b> You believe you are not a worthy champion because the wizards did not choose you. But Fate does not make mistakes. Neither did your son.
[Through this rousing speech, both Kent and Adam continue to fight back against their enemies in a truly inspiring tandem: separate, but united].
<b>Kent Nelson: [v.o.]</b> We were wrong about you. The world doesn’t always need a white knight. Sometimes it needs something darker.
[Adam defeats the last guard on his way to the barrier protecting the prison from the Antarctic waters and begins his run, despite bullets flying everywhere around him. Meanwhile, in Shiruta, Kent and his doppelgangers still successfully occupy Sabbac].
<b>Kent Nelson:</b> Don’t you dare give up on us now. The world needs you.
[Adam finally passes through the exit, swimming upwards. He soon removes his oxygen mask. In Shiruta, Carter is hopelessly punching the energy cocoon surrounding the palace as Kent and his duplicates finally gain the upper hand over Sabbac, trapping him in crystalline cuffs. Sabbac then breaks through and blasts Fate with fire, deactivating the shield and destroying the clone. The Doctor falters and falls down, exhausted. As the barrier vanishes, Carter runs straight into the palace].
[Slowly drowning in the freezing waters of Antarctica, Teth-Adam finally reaches the surface, floating on it, motionless. In Shiruta, Kent rises as Sabbac charges straight at him. Carter, Maxine and Al reach the throne room].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Kent!
[Nelson removes his helmet and stands bravely. Sabbac reaches him and punches a hole inside his chest. Kent gasps].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> NOOOO!
[Doctor Fate spares one final glance towards his teammates, then lowers his head. The helmet slides out of his hand and falls to the surface, as his body is incinerated and turned to ash. Sabbac then kicks it away and sits on the throw as the surviving JSA members lunge at him. He roars and a beam of pure, red light shoots into the already dark sky, punching a hole in it and turning it into a hellish sea of blood. Hawkman, Smasher and Cyclone are in mid-air, when he releases his clenched fist and causes an explosion. Somewhere else in the city, Amon and Adrianna stop, feeling the shaking ground].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Mom? What’s happening?
[Out of the ground, ghastly skeletons emerge and arise. They proceed to walk towards the boy and his mother].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s Sabbac. He commands the Legions of Hell.
[The skeletons come closer. Adrianna shields Amon with herself, grabbing a nearby metal pole].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Whatever happens… you stay behind me.
[The skeletons are dangerously close now. Suddenly, a van drives by from the side. It crushes and runs over the hellish soldiers in its way, while blasting "Baby Come Back" from its speakers. Karim stops the vehicle and exits, hitting the subsequent skeletons with some kind of bat].
<b>Karim:</b> "Ooh, baby!" [To Amon and Adriana] Don’t worry, I die by electricity.
[The mother and her son watch the brave electrician readying himself against the next adversaries].
<b>Karim:</b> You want some Kahndaq? Come and get it! Come and get it.
[He beats and hits next soldiers down with ease. Amon grabs a nearby pole as well, but Adrianna intervenes].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> No, no. No.
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Don’t send me home, I can help. 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> I know. But you can do better than swinging a stick.
[She looks at Amon and at this moment, he realizes what he needs to do. He rushes to the bazaar and Adrianna and Karim swing their sticks and poles around the van, bringing incoming skeletons down. In Antarctica, the unconscious Teth-Adam sees his wife and son in the afterlife. He hugs them both, they're all happy. He then lets them go and addresses his son].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> The Gods have brought us together again.
[But Hurut looks at him as if he was trying to remind him of something].
<b>Hurut:</b> It’s not your time, Father.
[Teth-Adam stares at him, confused. In Kahndaq, Amon reaches Shiruta's bazaar. He calls out to the citizesn hiding there].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Hey! What are you all standing around for? This is our chance.
[He raises his hands in The Champion's gesture - the triangle].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> With these hands, we built Kahndaq. And with these hands, we will set it free!
[In the afterlife, Teth-Adam tries to reason with his son, as his cold body in the real world floats on the surface].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> The people need a hero.
<b>Hurut:</b> No, Father. They need to be free.
[Rami, one of the citizens rejoicing Teth-Adam the day before, decides to join Amon].
<b>Rami:</b> What are we waiting for?
[In the palace, Carter is grabbed by Sabbac and lifted into the sky. Rami and dozens of other citizens perform the gesture. Teth-Adam feels the call of his people and knows what he's got to do].
<b>Hurut:</b> Say the word.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Shazam.
[The vision ends as his body is struck by lightning, ionizing the water in the polar lake. In Shiruta, Sabbac is holding Carter in the air by the wings, as the hero desperately tries to break free. He then spots the citizens joined in the call for Teth-Adam down below].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> The people of Kahndaq rise up against you.
[Sabbac frees one hand and blasts the Champion's statue with fire, dropping it on everyone at the bazaar. Everyone but Amon runs. The boy simply ducks down. The monument stops some miles above him. It is held up by none other than Teth-Adam. As his theme blares in a returning, triumphant manner, the Champion - now equipped with a new cape, golden gauntlets, golden belt and golden boots - lifts the statue up].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> YES!
[Al Rothstein stands up, now enlarged, helping Adam with holding the statue].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I got this. Go get him.
[Adam nods and lets go of the statue. He speeds right at Sabbac, who is trying to rip the wings off of the screaming Hawkman - and punches him with full force. Sabbac and Carter crash into the palace, while Adam gracefully glides inside].
<b>Teth-Adam: [to Hawkman]</b> You know what I have to do.
[The JSA leader acknowledges this].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Beat his ass.
<b>Sabbac:</b> Let the fate of Kahndaq be decided by a true battle of champions.
[Black Adam nods in agreement].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Let’s end this.
[Sabbac roars and blasts Adam with a combo of fire and lightning, successfully wounding the Champion, as evidenced by the red marks on his side. Teth-Adam then stops the charging demon by holding his horns, then hits him with his knee and takes him to the airspace, where they begin trading blows. At one point, he tries to remove his horned crown, but to no avail. On the streets, Karim and Adrianna prepare for another wave of hellish skeletons].
<b>Karim:</b> It’s a lot of them.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s a bit more than I thought. 
<b>Karim:</b> Yeah. 
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Just a bit.
[Sabbac gains the upper hand over Teth-Adam. A few headbutts and fire blasts, and the Champion's body begins showing significant injuries. On the streets, Amon suddenly appears on his skateboard, next to Adrianna and Karim].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Hey, mom.
[Behind him arrive the citizens of Kahndaq, armed with various kinds of "weapons" - bars, poles, sticks, staffs. Rami is leading the charge].
<b>Rami:</b> These are our streets. Our city!
[Adrianna smiles at her resourceful son as the citizens charge at the skeletons].
<b>Rami:</b> Free Kahndaq!
[In the airspace, the wounded Black Adam is blasted down back to the throne room by Sabbac. The Demon Champion hovers over his damaged enemy].
<b>Sabbac:</b> The wizards’ powers were wasted on you. You are not a hero.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> No. I’m not.
[Suddenly, Sabbac is pierced by a metal bar from behind, wielded by Carter Hall as the JSA theme plays once again].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> But he is.
[Sabbac breaks the bar, turns, lifts Hawkman and pierces him with the bar, choking him. Carter raises his head and hollers, the visual matching perfectly with the previous visions from Fate's helmet].
<b>Sabbac:</b> You cannot stand against me. I am Kahndaq’s true champion. 
[Suddenly, Carter disappears, and his helmet falls on the ground. Sabbac is utterly flabbergasted by this development. He turns only to see... Hawkman and dozens of his clones appearing in front of him].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I learned this trick from an old friend.
[In his right hand rests the Helmet of Fate, two rageful eyes ignited on it, as if were expressing its fury after its owner's death. Now, surrounded by several Hawkmen, Sabbac is tackled by them and pinned to the throne. Teth-Adam emerges from behind, grabbing Sabbac's head, intending to separate him from his horned crown. In the streets, Adrianna, Amon and the people of Kahndaq are joined by Cyclone and Atom Smasher in their efforts against the Legions of Hell. Teth-Adam increases his power output, desperately trying to vanquish Sabbac. It is in this moment, that the real Hawkman calls out to him].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> You can control it! You have to!
[Eventually, Teth-Adam binds Sabbac in a web of lightning, pulling him up and repelling Carter, who drops the helmet and merges with his copies. In the skies, Teth-Adam is holding Sabbac, infusing him with enough energy to weaken him].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Tell them the Man in Black sent you.
[With this perfectly delivered one-liner, Teth-Adam proceeds to split Sabacc's body in half from the head to the legs, before dropping it. Out of the corpse pours out lava. In the streets, all the skeletons suddenly vanish and the sky returns to normal. The citizens of Kahndaq begin to cheer and rejoice].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Yes! 
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> Yes!
[Back in the throne room, the Helmet of Fate, is lying in the corner, abandoned. Carter struggles to get up before being helped up by Teth-Adam. The winged hero deactivates his helmet and wings].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> I never tought I’d be happy to see you.
[Teth-Adam just smiles, and then straightens his face, looking at the helmet].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> I’m only here because of him.
[Carter looks at the helmet as well].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> That makes two of us.
[Al and Maxine reach the room as Carter picks the helmet up].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> See you around, old friend.
[The helmet then disintegrates into nothingness. Adrianna, Amon and Karim join everyone in the room].
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Think you can keep him out of trouble?
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> As long as no one comes looking for it.
<b>Carter Hall:</b> Fair enough. [to Teth-Adam] Just be careful. The kind of justice you dish out can darken your soul.
[Adrianna instantly provides a counterpoint to that].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> It’s his darkness that lets him do what heroes like you cannot.
<b>Carter Hall: [smirking]</b> I guess we’ll find out, won’t we?
[He turns and walks away. Maxine joins him. Al stumbles over before Black Adam, awkwardly, and finally says what he wants to say].
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> I tought we made a pretty good team back there. Just saying.
[Teth-Adam nods and smiles].
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> We made a great team.
<b>Al Rothstein:</b> Maybe we could… 
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Don’t push it.
<b>Maxine Hunkel: [v.o.]</b> Smasher, let’s go.
[Al nods as a goodbye and walks away as well. Adrianna, Amon, Karim and Adam take a stride towards the palace's balcony. The people of Kahndaq are rejoicing everywhere, praising their Champion].
Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion! Long live the Champion!
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> You could lead them.
[Teth-Adam slowly walks to the throne and finally sits on it. He tries to think of a good pose before he finally takes it - the pose of a "thinking monarch"].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> How does it feel?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> ...Wrong.
[Karim nods. Teth-Adam launches into the air and dives back down, crushing and smashing the throne to pieces. He levitates above it].
<b>Amon Tomaz:</b> So… what now? Does this mean you’re finally gonna be our hero?
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Kahndaq has always had heroes. And it still does. What is needs now is a protector.
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> Thank you, Teth-Adam.
<b>Teth-Adam:</b> Perhaps that name is a little… old-fashioned.
[Amon nods in agreement].
<b>Adrianna Tomaz:</b> So what should we call you?
[Teth-Adam stares into the distance, thinking of a better name... and he finally finds it].
<i><b>[CUE CREDITS AND THE TITLE CARD: "BLACK ADAM"].</b></i>
[A drone descends from the top of the cave, touching the ground several feet away from Black Adam. Adam approaches it slowly. A hologram of Amanda Waller flashes to life.]
<b>Waller:</b> Okay, "Black Adam". My name is Amanda Waller. Congratulations; you have my attention. This is gonna be your only warning... You don't wanna stay in my prison, that's fine. Kahndaq is your prison now. You step one foot outside of it, you will not live to regret it.
<b>Black Adam:</b> There's no one on this planet that can stop me.
<b>Waller:</b> I can call in a favor and send in people who <i>aren't</i> from this planet.
<b>Black Adam:</b> Send them all.
<b>Black Adam:</b> ...as you wish.
[Adam shoots lighting at the bot and it explodes, kicking up a plume of dust. Seconds later, a caped silhouette descends through the smoke. Black Adam stares into it, prepared to fight. A figure steps out...]
<b>Superman:</b> It's been a while since anyone's made the world this nervous.
[Henry Cavill's Superman steps into the light, clad in his blue, gold, and red costume. John Williams' theme plays.]
<b>Superman:</b> Black Adam... We should talk.
[Adam smirks.]
