<i>[Open on a shot of a mountain near a lake. Jesse Pinkman steps into frame and lights a cigarette.]</i>
<b>Jesse Pinkman:</b> You know he's not gonna be happy.
<b>Mike Ehrmantraut:</b> No, I suspect he won't. Only you can decide what's best for you, Jesse. Not him, not me...
<b>Jesse:</b> I'm out. So, what are you gonna do with all that money?
<b>Mike:</b> Same thing I do with all the other money. How 'bout you, teenage retiree? You'll be living the dream.
<b>Jesse:</b> Not sure I should stick around town...
<b>Mike:</b> Well, that's a start.
<b>Jesse:</b> Nothing really keeping me here. Where would you go, if you were me?
<b>Mike:</b> Doesn't matter; I'm not you.
<b>Jesse:</b> Seriously, c'mon. Like, if you were my age...? Just play along, make some conversation.
<b>Mike:</b> Alaska.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah?
<b>Mike:</b> Yeah, if I were your age, starting fresh... Alaska. It's the last frontier. Up there, you can be anything you want.
<b>Jesse:</b> Alaska... Start over. Start fresh...
<b>Mike:</b> One could.
<b>Jesse:</b> Put things right.
<b>Mike:</b> No. Sorry, kid, that's the one thing you can never do.
<i>[Jesse stares at the running lake, pensive and clearly considering Mike's words.]</i>
<i>[Hard cut to Jesse looking how we last saw him in "Felina" -- haggard and bearded, driving away in Todd's El Camino, and screaming, happy to be free. His jubilation turns to panic as he notices police lights in the distance. Pulling off into a driveway, he turns the lights off and crouches down near the glovebox, pulling a gun out. A squad of police cars -- presumably the same ones that will find Walter White dead on the floor of the Neo-Nazis' lab in a few minutes -- speed past him.]</i>
<i>[After they have gone, Jesse leans up in the seat, gun still in his hands, and he pulls out, destroying a mail box before speeding off into the night.]</i>
<i>[Cut to a POV shot as a car drives down the desert road before suddenly crashing into a pile of rocks. From somewhere offscreen, Badger laughs.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> Dude, you suck!
<i>[Pull back to reveal that Badger and Skinny Peter are playing a driving game.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> This thing's, like, defective and shit! There's, like, Cheeto dust in the controller.
<i>[Pete blows on the controller in an attempt to clear some of the dust out.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> It's a bad carpenter that blames his hammer, yo.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Whatever.
<b>Badger:</b> You're apexing too early. You're apexing too early--!
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> I'm apexing at the apex, bitch! Don't be telling me how to drive and shit! You couldn't drive a two-button elevator.
<b>Badger:</b> You couldn't drive Miss Daisy.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Whatever that means... You couldn't drive a short bus full of slow kids to the zoo.
<b>Badger:</b> Yeah, that's because I'd be too distracted by you! You'd be sitting up front in your special helmet, trying to hump my leg. On account, you couldn't drive Thelma and Louise off of that cliff! <i>Apex!</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> I can't apex more than I'm already apexing!
<b>Badger:</b> <i>[huffs]</i> You drive like a blind guy with no legs!
<i>[Behind the two of them, a shadow -- Jesse -- creeps up near the window and peers into the house.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Don't you-- You drive like my dead grandmoms!
<b>Badger:</b> That's disrespectful.
<i>[Outside, Jesse looks in before a car pulling up grabs his attention. He pushes himself into a corner as the car's headlights pass over the house, past him. Once they taper off, Jesse turns back to the door, leaning forward until his forehead is almost touching the wood. He slams an open palm on it several times. Skinny Pete looks out the window, doing a double take, before turning on the porch light and opening the door a few inches.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> ...Dude, you lost?
<i>[Jesse gives him a wordless, weary look.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> <i>[Offscreen]</i> Who is it?
<i>[Pete's eyes widen, realizing --]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Jesse...?
<i>[Jesse nods slightly. Badger opens the door further.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> Who is it--?
<i>[Badger, also surprised, gives him a once-over.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> I gotta get that car off the street.
<i>[Badger removes a portion fence, guiding the El Camino into the backyard. As Jesse pulls in, he knocks over a basketball hoop. Badger runs over to the car, thumping on the window.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> Yo, yo--!
<i>[Some time later, Badger and Skinny Pete walk into their house, staring at Jesse as he tears into a cup of instant ramen. Badger removes his beanie, clearly saddened.]</i>
<i>[Later, Jesse collapses into a bed in another room and falls asleep near-instantly. Skinny Pete takes a moment to stare, then wordlessly turns out the light. Badger walks up next to him.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Come check out what's on TV.
<b>Jesse:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> Man, what's wrong with you? I ain't watching no TV right now!
<b>Badger:</b> <i>(whispering)</i> It's the news...
<i>[Badger walks back into the living room. Skinny Pete takes another moment before pulling the door, leaving it open a crack.]</i>
<i>[A time lapse of a highway into and out of Albuquerque takes us into morning, followed by a shot of the strip mall where Saul Goodman &amp; Associates was once located, followed by a shot of a Twisters -- the former Los Pollos Hermanos.]</i>
<b>Female Anchor:</b> <i>[Voice over]</i> Is it true that a military-grade firearm was altered and used to carry out this attack?
<i>[Cut back to the television at Badger and Skinny Pete's house.]</i>
<b>DEA Head:</b> To the best of my knowledge, it was an M16 Machine Gun which, yes, that's strictly military-issue weapon. As to where he could've obtained such a weapon or the so-called, uh... "remote control" aspect of it, anything I can say at this point would just be conjecture and I'm not going to engage in that.
<i>[Cut to Badger and Skinny Pete watching the TV, worried.]</i>
<b>DEA Head:</b> Yes.
<b>Male Anchor:</b> Could you tell us more about this Person of Interest? We're hearing a lot of conflicting information about whether this person took part in the killings, or whether they were, in fact -- I guess the word we keep hearing is "liberated". Were they liberated by White from some sort of captivity?
<b>DEA Head:</b> I'm not prepared at this time to say any more than that; they're our Person of Interest, and they may have information relevant to this case or other cases the DEA is investigating.
<i>[Back in the bedroom, Jesse rolls over and wakes up, briefly seeing the top of his cage, covered by a tarp. After a minute, he blinks the image away, now face to face with an unfamiliar ceiling. As if posessed, he springs off the bed, ripping the curtain away from the window. From the living room, Badger and Skinny Pete hear the commotion and rush into the other room, where Jesse attempts to force open the shutters. Badger and Skinny Pete kick the door open, but Jesse pulls Todd's gun on them, forcing them to take cover behind the doorway.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's-- Jesse! Hey, hey! Hey!
<b>Jesse:</b> Who's there?!
<b>Badger:</b> It's cool, man, it's us!
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> It's us! It's us, Jesse, you're safe! It's us...
<i>[Exhausted, Jesse lowers the gun and sinks to the floor, setting the gun on the table beside him. Badger and Skinny Pete peer their heads in.]</i>
<i>[Some time later, Skinny Pete opens his closet, pulling several shirts and pairs of pants out.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> My stuff's gonna fit you like a tee, yo! Not like if you had to borrow from Sasquatch over here...
<b>Badger:</b> Can't help it that I'm sized for love.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Yeah, you go love all the giraffes you want, bitch. Me and Jesse are sticking with the ladies. Yeah, this here's barely worn!
<i>[He presents a shirt to an unresponsive Jesse.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> How's this working for you? Good?
<i>[Badger shakes his head.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Jesse...?
<i>[Jesse remains silent, but nods affirmatively. Pete sets the shirt down.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Right on! Get you some new clothes, then... A shower'll make you feel a whole lot better! Truth be told, you look like you're hurting for one...
<b>Badger:</b> Church. No offense.
<i>[Later, Jesse, Badger and Skinny Pete stand in the bathroom doorway.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Got you a clean towel, the one on the right. Uh, kinda. And, um, feel free to open a new bar of Irish Spring, whatever. It's underneath, yo, 'cause the old one has, like, hairs on it and shit, and uh... Uh, yo! I got Axe Body Spray, I got Obsession For Men, I got Tommy Hilfinger, feel free to use any of 'em you want, y'know, use 'em all...
<b>Badger:</b> Obsession's the bomb, yo. I got it for him for Christmas.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Oh, uh... Hey! Um... Maybe don't like... Shave and whatnot, y'know. Uh, be less recognizable?
<i>[Jesse goes to close the door, but then...]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> Jesse, did they really...
<b>Jesse:</b> ...what?
<b>Badger:</b> Did they really keep you in a cage?
<i>[On Badger and Skinny Pete's somber looks, Jesse slides the door shut. He activates the hot water, sending unidentifiable gunk into the shower drain.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Whoa, dude, why'd you--?!
<b>Badger:</b> Lookin' sharp, yo.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Yeah... Lookin' sharp! Feel like a new man?
<i>[A freshly-shaven Jesse Pinkman stares out the window with grim purpose.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah. Thanks.
<i>[Jesse pulls the curtains shut. Badger offers him a weed cigarette.]</i>
<b>Badger:</b> You want a little something to take the edge off?
<i>[Jesse ignores it, surveying the area.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Why'd you, uh, turn off the TV? News that bad?
<b>Badger:</b> There's just, uh, a whole lot of it.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah. I gotta get out of here.
<b>Badger:</b> ...Where to? You got a plan?
<i>[Jesse storms over to the phone book and rifles through it.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Maybe.
<i>[He rips a page out and pockets it.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey, uh... Skinny. You got a burner you can give me?
<i>[Pete offers him a burner phone.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Fully charged and clean as a whistle.
<i>[Jesse walks back over to the window and dials a number.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> First... I gotta get rid of that car.
<b>Old Joe:</b> Go for Joe.
<i>[Joe listens to the other end, then leans forward.]</i>
<b>Old Joe:</b> Yeah, I know who this is. At this point, who doesn't?
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey.
<b>Old Joe:</b> Where's the victim?
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh, it's in the back. Thank you so much for doing this, Joe. Listen, about the money, if we can make it--
<b>Old Joe:</b> It's on the house. Good kid; least I could do.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Watch it, bitch!
<b>Old Joe:</b> You gentlemen threw me plenty of business back in the day, I got no complaints in that department. "Magnets!" Yeah? That was a good one.
<b>Jesse:</b> Joe...
<b>Old Joe:</b> Frankly, y'know, I can tell you now... I had zero confidence that that would work. None whatsoever, but hey! Live and learn.
<b>Jesse:</b> Joe, what are you doing?
<b>Old Joe:</b> Writing myself a little insurance policy. Y'know, strictly precautionary... Belt and suspenders... Okay! Alright, mind at ease. I think we're good.
<i>[Joe's device begins to beep.]</i>
<b>Old Joe:</b> Whoa!
<b>Jesse:</b> Joe! Joe! Hey-- Joe, what are you doing?!
<b>Old Joe:</b> Fleeing, and I suggest you do the same. LoJack; the company just activated it, just this minute. Talk about timing!
<b>Jesse:</b> Just--
<b>Old Joe:</b> Look, Johnny Law is on his way, as in here, as in now, so farewell, goodbye, regrets, et cetera, et cetera. 
<b>Jesse:</b> Joe--!
<b>Jesse:</b> Skinny... I'm sorry. Who's got the keys to that car? Keys!
<i>[Jesse uncovers the El Camino, but before he can get in, Skinny Pete stands in front of the door.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Yo. Yo, what are you doing?! We gotta get this thing outta here!
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Badger, gimme the keys to your Fiero.
<b>Badger:</b> Why?
<i>[Pete impatiently snaps and Badger hands the keys over.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Now, you take my car.
<b>Badger:</b> I don't even like your car. <i>[After Skinny jingles the keys, he takes them.]</i> ...it drives like a dick...
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Badger drives my T-Bird two, three-hundred miles away, then ditches it. Think you'll be heading to Mexico?
<b>Jesse:</b> No. Not Mexico.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Right on, even better! <i>[To Badger]</i> Leave it near the border. Hide it, kinda? But, yo, don't hide it so good the cops can't find it. Wipe it down for prints, then hitchhike back. Don't let nobody see you in that car! <i>[To Jesse]</i> You, take Badger's Fiero.
<b>Jesse:</b> What about Badger's car?
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> It stays right here! Ain't like the cops don't already know where it is! I'll tell 'em you dropped by, the two of us smoked a fat bowl, traded pink slips, then you split! I always wanted me an El Camino, and that's church, yo. I'll pass any lie detector they give me! It's what's happening... You got any cash?
<i>[Jesse shakes his head "no". Pete hands him a roll of cash -- presumably the same one he was gifted in "Felina". Badger sorts through his money, fanning it out.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Yo, kick in, bitch!
<b>Badger:</b> I'm doin' it! Jesus... 
<i>[Badger hands him the money.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Guys, I don't know what to say...
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Don't say nothin'. Just go!
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Seatbelt. Speed limit. You got about three hours to get this thing down south. I'll keep my mouth shut 'til then, but after that? They gonna be putting an APB out on this bitch.
<b>Badger:</b> I'll get her there. Take care of her, Jesse. She's a special lady.
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> That right there is a clown car. No self-respecting outlaw would ever get caught dead in that thing. That's why it's perfect, yo, deep cover!
<b>Badger:</b> <i>Vaya con Dios</i>, amigo.
<b>Jesse:</b> Oh, T-- Uh, the El Camino, let me see the keys...
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Hold up. <i>[Pete hands Jesse his beanie.]</i> Just might keep you from getting spotted. Can't hurt, right?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yo, Skinny... Why are you doing all this?
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> Dude... You're my hero 'n shit.
<b>Todd:</b> Jesse? You awake? Jesse?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah.
<b>Todd:</b> Everything good?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah. Good.
<b>Todd:</b> Great! You want a cigarette?
<i>[Jesse nods.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Thanks...
<b>Todd:</b> Yeah! Guy on the TV keeps calling for rain. What do you think?
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh, I don't know.
<b>Todd:</b> Guy said, like, f-- Forty percent chance yesterday? Sixty percent today... Maybe it was even fifty, yesterday. But so far... I mean, I-- Yeah, I see clouds, but I-- I wouldn't call 'em rainclouds, just regular... Regular "cloud" clouds. Anyway, that's what they look like to me.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah, well those guys aren't... always that accurate.
<b>Todd:</b> Yeah, right. I'm not putting myself out there as any kinda expert or whatnot, but I do think it's gonna be... a beautiful afternoon. And guess what? We're all alone!
<b>Jesse:</b> ...yeah?
<b>Todd:</b> Yeah, Uncle Jack took everybody down to Elephant Butte on account of, he got this new Chaparral. It's pretty badass, but I told him I'm not really... big into water skiing, plus somebody's gotta take care of you. It took some convincing, but now... it's just you and me the whole weekend. I-- I'd really like your help with something.
<b>Todd:</b> So... I-- I hate to be all like... But we gotta talk ground rules, uh, if you try to, y'know, escape... I'm gonna have to visit the little boy, it'll basically be out of my hands at that point. Uncle Jack made you that promise, and he's gonna wanna stick to it, so... good behavior, right? Right? Good. I appreciate it, Jesse. 
<b>Todd:</b> Gotta make sure you don't draw too much attention. I'm gonna do a better job of keeping you clean from now on, 'kay? I promise.
<b>Todd:</b> Good job.
<b>Todd:</b> Hey, check this out! There's no water in it. There used to be water in it, a couple years ago, but they took it out because of some insurance thing. Okay, so, it's not actually that heavy but, uh... Try as I might, I can't ever get this thing on by myself. What are you better at, going forwards or backwards?
<i>[Jesse shrugs.]</i>
<b>Todd:</b> Okay, well. let's both go sideways for a while.
<b>Todd:</b> <i>[grunts]</i> Watch your fingers.
<b>Todd:</b> I thought maybe I could just hang it from the ceiling here, just drive right under and dump it in, but my landlord didn't really like that idea. I guess that's good. I found this thing on Craigslist, so... Yeah!
<b>Jesse:</b> So, is that what you... needed help with?
<b>Todd:</b> Part of it.
<b>Radio Anchor:</b> The drug kingpin once known throughout the southwest as "Heisenberg" may yet claim a final victim. Texas authorities investigating the poisoning of a Houston woman are looking into her possible connection to Walter White's criminal organization. The unnamed woman who is hospitalized in critical condition is not expected to survive. White, the former Albuquerque school teacher who was the subject of a six-month international manhunt, was found dead late Tuesday at the scene of a gang massacre which claimed the lives of nine people.
<i>[Jesse silently reacts -- shock.]</i>
<b>Radio Anchor:</b> <i>(distant)</i> The dollar is down on the foreign exchange markets after a seemingly turbulent week for the Euro. The DOW Jones is down 15 points, the NASDAQ is down 34 points, and the S&amp;P 500 is up 10 points...
<i>A car drives past and Jesse turns, hiding his face in his shoulder. Headlights drag over his face.]</i>
<b>Lou:</b> Hey there, look what the cat dragged in! Did I hear voices? Were you talking to somebody?
<b>Todd:</b> Nope, not that I know of. Hey there, Lou, whatcha up to?
<b>Lou:</b> A little horticulture maintenance, uh, this ficus down at your end's been looking kinda puny! Gotta keep the thrift bugs off it.
<b>Todd:</b> So, is a ficus technically a plant or a tree?
<b>Lou:</b> I'd say it all depends, uh, keep in mind, you got over 800 species up in the garden.
<b>Todd:</b> Wow! Well, alright, Lou, you have a good one!
<b>Lou:</b> Yeah, don't take any wood nickels!
<b>Todd:</b> Whoa, man! That guy... he's not supposed to be home at this hour. We really lucked out that he didn't see you. He's just always lurking around, being nosy... I mean, he was in Vietnam, which I totally respect, but still... How do you like my place?
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh, yeah, it's-- it's nice. Kinda... pastel, but in a good way.
<b>Todd:</b> Yeah, right? I-- I was thinking of easter eggs. But... Lately I'm thinking I might like to try some new paint, this stuff is starting to feel pretty tired.
<b>Jesse:</b> Okay. So, you-- Sure, that's why I'm here, so you want me to help you paint?
<b>Todd:</b> Maybe! Yeah, if we have some time left over, but first, um... 
<b>Jesse:</b> Oh, shit! Jesus! Todd! What...? What--? Oh, shit!
<b>Todd:</b> Okay, please don't, y'know... Make me feel worse than I already do.
<b>Jesse:</b> Who is this?!
<b>Todd:</b> Sonya, the cleaning lady. And, honestly... I don't feel much like talking about it, so. You wanna give me a hand, Jesse?
<b>Todd:</b> Just keep it straight. Oh, well- w- wait, uh... Unroll it.
<b>Todd:</b> Kinda need this!
<b>Todd:</b> Okay. Now we just gotta wait for Nosy Lou to go bowling. I think he leaves in, like, an hour. You want some soup? You want soup? I got chicken noodle, chicken stars, cream of chicken... Ah, bean with bacon! One left, Jesse.
<b>Jesse:</b> What did she do to you?
<b>Todd:</b> What? Oh, she didn't... Do anything to me.
<b>Jesse:</b> Then... why?
<b>Todd:</b> Right there. That book, if you wanna know so bad. Uncle Jack taught me, always keep my money close. So... I have these old World Book Encyclopedias, the whole entire set, A to Z. My Grammy gave 'em to me. I was in middle school, but I figured "nobody needs books anymore 'cause everything's on the computer". Uh, seemed like a good hiding place. Plus, I had all these other volumes left to fill.
<b>Jesse:</b> So your cleaning lady was stealing your money?
<b>Todd:</b> What? No! She was as honest as the day is long. Like, George Washington honest. But she found it, and I can't have anybody finding it. She brought it straight in here to show me. She actually thought I didn't know it was there. I just-- I-- wondered what the heck she was looking up. She barely spoke any English. 'M' for Mexico, maybe? I dunno. It was weird.
<b>Jesse:</b> Where are you gonna take her?
<b>Todd:</b> Some place pretty. She deserves that. Hey, do me a favor and put that away, would you? Just straight down the hall, all the way in the back, there's a whole shelf of 'em. Thanks. Sure you don't want any soup?
<b>Todd:</b> How do you like my bedroom? Pretty bitchin', huh?
<b>Todd:</b> Be sure to alphabetize 'em!
<b>Todd:</b> Guess I better come up with a new hiding place for my money.
<b>Jesse:</b> ...They got these things called "banks".
<b>Todd:</b> Actually, I think I know the perfect spot. It might take a little engineering, but... I mean, it would be right here. Nobody would ever find it. Nothing beats cash on hand, that's what Uncle Jack says.
<b>Diane Pinkman:</b> --an average kid.
<b>Adam Pinkman:</b> Yeah, he-- He liked to draw, he was good at that. 
<b>Female News Anchor:</b> When was the last time you saw him?
<b>Adam:</b> Uh... A year? Maybe more? I mean, it was way before August.
<b>Female News Anchor:</b> Is there anything you wish you could say to your son right now?
<b>Diane:</b> Please... Come forward. Too many people have... For your sake, for everybody's sake. Son, turn yourself in.
<b>Todd:</b> You wanna say a few words?
<b>Jesse:</b> ...no!
<b>Todd:</b> Nice-- Nice lady. Excellent housekeeper.
<b>Todd:</b> Um-- Hey, grab another pack, wouldja? There should be one in the glovebox.
<b>Todd:</b> You find 'em?
<b>Todd:</b> I'll take that, Jesse.
<b>Todd:</b> Jesse, I'll-- I'll take that.
<b>Todd:</b> On the way home, I was gonna get us some pizza. A couple large pies. Maybe a six pack of beers. Some ice cold beer. That sound good? 'Cause- 'cause you earned it today, you definitely did. What kinda pizza do you like, Jesse?
<b>Todd:</b> Jesse, what kinda pizza?
<b>Jesse:</b> Pepperoni.
<b>Todd:</b> Pepperoni, sure. Classic! I like that, too.
<b>Todd:</b> Aw. Look at that view. Should be a heck of a sunset! You know what Uncle Jack says? That life is what you make it...
<b>Jesse:</b> God...
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah!
<b>Casey:</b> Jesus...
<b>Casey:</b> Jesus!
<b>Lou:</b> Hello?
<b>Lou:</b> Oh, hey, you folks are back, huh? Wow...  When you search a place, you really search it!
<b>Neil:</b> Sir, what can I do for you?
<b>Lou:</b> Well, I'm Louis Schanzer, I live across the hall down in Unit 11. I talked to your guys yesterday; I got a card from one of your Sergeants. I just want you to know, I'm around if you ever need any additional information.
<b>Neil:</b> M'kay. Great.
<b>Lou:</b> See, I knew the decedent pretty well, never really trusted him. Be honest? I kinda saw this thing comin'. I mean-- Well, not exactly, but kinda.
<b>Neil:</b> Great. Well, we'll definitely keep that in mind.
<b>Casey:</b> Yeah. Definitely. Thank you!
<b>Lou:</b> You guys have business cards?
<b>Casey:</b> No, I'm-- I'm sorry, we're fresh out. Just take it easy.
<b>Lou:</b> You too, and hey, listen. You ever need any help with this case, I've done a little investigating myself, I--
<b>Neil:</b> Okay... I'll start here, you start in the back, let's meet in the middle.
<b>Casey:</b> I mean, Jesus...
<b>Casey:</b> Neil, they tossed the shit outta this place! What's left to find?
<b>Neil:</b> Shut up and look!
<br/>
<b>Neil:</b> What are you doing?
<b>Jesse:</b> Taking my half.
<b>Neil:</b> Wow, yeah? You a little man with big dreams? Yeah? Hey, if I were you, I'd walk the hell out of here right now.
<b>Neil:</b> I'll shoot you, you son of a bitch. I will <i>shoot</i> you.
<b>Jesse:</b> Then do it, already. If I don't get this money, I am dead anyway. Alright, and if you pull that trigger, then you are gonna have to kill that loudmouth down the hall and every other witness in the place. And you will be as fucked as I am. So... What's it gonna be?
<b>Neil:</b> Three-way split and you got your third. No pushing.
<br/>
<b>Customer:</b> It's colorful. I'll say that much.
<b>Ed:</b> Yes, it is! Uh, I don't expect you to ever lose it in your closet.
<b>Customer:</b> Mm. And no dirt bag to replace?
<b>Ed:</b> That's correct. A lot of our customers find that handy and practical.
<b>Customer:</b> But they want an arm and a leg to pay for it. And I ain't paying for no paint job.
<b>Ed:</b> Yes, I agree, it's very expensive. But it's a fine product. But if you are in love with your Kirby, I'll bet I can get it working for you again.
<i>[Jesse enters the shop.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Uh, be with you in a minute.
<b>Customer:</b> Fixing my Kirby, how much would that cost?
<b>Ed:</b> Well, I won't know until I take a good look at it, and if it, uh-- Now, if it needed a new motor, it'd be a little bit expensive, but certainly not as expensive as a new Dyson. The estimate's free and, uh, all you gotta do is bring it in here.
<b>Customer:</b> I may take you up on that.
<b>Ed:</b> Excellent!
<b>Customer:</b> If I can get my niece to help me.
<b>Ed:</b> Yes, they do. Now, I want you to promise you won't try and bring it in by yourself -- get that help.
<b>Customer:</b> Mm. I just don't know why they can't make things that last any more.
<b>Ed:</b> Oh, you're singing my song! I want you to have a great day, now!
<b>Customer:</b> Thank you! Thanks for your help, I'll be back with my Kirby.
<b>Ed:</b> Excellent! Drive carefully.
<b>Ed:</b> If there's any questions I can help you with, just let me know.
<i>[Ed calmly walks back to his desk, seemingly not recognizing the man in front of him. Jesse stills for a moment before beelining to the door, flipping the sign at the front from "Open" to "Closed".]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> I'd appreciate if you wouldn't do that -- I'm open for business.
<i>[Jesse stumbles over to the salesman, hands in his pockets.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Um, I need a... Hoover Max, Pressure Max, Max Pressure. Hoover, maybe it's a Pro Max. You got, like a-- Like, a filter?
<b>Ed:</b> Hoover products are right over there on the wall behind you.
<b>Jesse:</b> Look, I don't remember the exact password, alright? But it was a vacuum thing. Okay, fine.
<i>[He lugs his garbage bag of money on the table and begins counting through a select stack.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Here you go. Four, six, ten... Fourteen, sixteen, eighteen, twenty, twenty-two, twenty-four, twenty-five. There you go. 125 thousand.
<i>[Ed stares at the young man, incredulous.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> C'mon, man, you know why I'm here!
<b>Ed:</b> I can't say I do, no.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah, you do! You're the guy! Yeah, you <i>do</i>! You're <i>the guy!</i> Look, I am 96 percent sure that you are the guy, so why don't you just, like, admit it? Oh-- Look, alright?
<i>[Jesse pulls up his shirt, spinning around -- his back is heavily scarred, from what we can see.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> No wire! Okay, no wire! And no gun. 'kay? And nobody knows I'm here. I just need... I just need your services. Alright, on the day at the pickup spot, you pulled up in a minivan. A red Toyota minivan, looks like a kidney bean -- same exact minivan you got parked out back, alright? I saw it! Alright... You got rules, alright? I get that, and I apologize, seriously. I didn't go with you that day, and I am sorry. Look, you will never know how sorry, but I am <i>here</i> now, alright? And I have cash. So please, okay? Please...
<b>Ed:</b> You owe me for that first pickup.
<b>Jesse:</b> YES! Oh, you're the guy--! What?!
<b>Ed:</b> This... <i>[He points at the money.]</i> is previously owed. Going forward, were we to, would require an additional 125.
<b>Jesse:</b> Alright. Fair's fair. Deal's a deal, alright? Look --
<i>[He pulls the rest of the money out of the bag and counts through it.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Four, eight, ten, fourteen, eighteen, twenty... twenty one... Twenty two. Twenty two... Twenty three--
<b>Ed:</b> By my arithmetic, you're ten thousand shy.
<i>[Haltingly, Jesse pulls Badger and Skinny Pete's money out of his pocket.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> 82 hundred. 82 hundred.
<i>[Ed points at the garbage bag.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> May I borrow this?
<i>[Without waiting for an answer, he grabs the trash bag and shoves the money into it.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> What are you doing?
<b>Ed:</b> I am gathering your belongings.
<b>Jesse:</b> No, no, no... No, no, no, stop--!
<b>Ed:</b> I'm not gonna try to collect what you owe me. I don't think it would end well for either one of us. This is not an inconsequential amount of money.
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey, listen to me--!
<b>Ed:</b> Spend it wisely, it will last you for years.
<b>Jesse:</b> Please, you don't understand!
<b>Ed:</b> Keep a low profile, travel by night.
<b>Jesse:</b> No--!
<b>Ed:</b> With a little luck, you will find yourself many miles from here. Godspeed to you.
<b>Jesse:</b> So that's it?
<b>Ed:</b> That's it. Now please leave.
<b>Jesse:</b> You are going to <i>jack me up...</i> over a measly eighteen hundred?!
<b>Ed:</b> I've got to reopen. The longer you stick around here, the more you jeopardize yourself.
<b>Jesse:</b> No-- Hey! No, hey. Have you been watching the news?
<b>Ed:</b> I have, very much so.
<b>Jesse:</b> So you hear what they've been saying about me. Yeah?
<b>Ed:</b> Yeah.
<b>Jesse:</b> Look, these people... They have kept me in a concrete hole. Look, I don't even know what <i>month</i> it is! They made me watch when they-- When they shot someone I--
<b>Ed:</b> If you believe that you can pull on people's heartstrings, you should take your chances with the police. From where I sit, you made your own luck. As did your former partner. As did your lawyer. You said it yourself, a deal's a deal.
<b>Jesse:</b> No. I am not. Going anywhere. I am staying right here until you help me.
<b>Jesse:</b> What are you doing?
<b>Ed:</b> Hi, yes. There's a young man in my store and he refuses to leave.
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey. Stop--
<b>Ed:</b> I-- Yeah, he might be armed.
<b>Jesse:</b> Stop, hey--!
<b>Ed:</b> Uh, not overtly, but, uh, yes, I'm beginning to feel threatened.
<b>Jesse:</b> Are you serious right now?!
<b>Ed:</b> Uh, yes, my name is Ed Galibraith, I own Best Quality Vaccum, 2714 4th Street. Northwest, that's correct. I... would appreciate it very much if you sent someone immediately.
<b>Jesse:</b> You... are so full of crap. You didn't call anybody just now! You faked it. And you wanna know how I know? You got as much to lose as I do. More! Way more! When your "cops" get here and they bust me, first question they're gonna ask is what am I doing here, trying to hand over a hefty bag full of cash to a dude runs a vacuum cleaner store? What comes out then, huh?! Oh, and uh, you wanna know what else is bullshit? Y'know, like, word to the wise, next time you try to pull this shit on someone, you don't just hang up on a 911 call. They won't let you! Because the lady, or dude, or whoever, is like "Stay on the line with me, sir! Stay on the line until the officers arrive." And if you <i>did</i> hang up, they'd call you back immediately. But hey! Guess what? Seriously, yo! Pathetic.
<b>Ed:</b> Wow, you love that response time.
<b>Ed:</b> Take your money.
<b>Ed:</b> Officers, thank you very much for getting here so fast; he obviously heard my call--
<b>Cop 1:</b> Is he still here?
<b>Ed:</b> No, he's not, he's gone, I, uh-- He... was spooked by my phone call and he headed up northbound, uh, on foot, maybe 30 seconds ago.
<b>Cop 2:</b> Can you describe him?
<b>Ed:</b> Uh, sure I can! He was, uh, young. Uh, he was white. Skinny. Very tall guy, six-five? Six-six. Had a tattoo over his right eyebrow, interesting -- A large insect.
<b>Ed:</b> Best Quality Vacuum, how may I help you?
<b>Jesse:</b> A deal's a deal? Your word is your bond?
<b>Ed:</b> ...it is.
<b>Jesse:</b> I'll get you your money.
<b>Diane:</b> Hello.
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey, Mom.
<b>Diane:</b> Jesse... It's Jesse!
<b>Adam:</b> G-- Gimme-- Give me the phone! Jesse! Is that you.
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey, Dad, yeah, it's me. How are the both of you doing?
<b>Adam:</b> We've been better.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah. How's Jake? Can I say hi to him?
<b>Adam:</b> Jake's on a band trip to London, thank God, Jesse--
<b>Diane and Adam:</b> Jesse, where are you?!
<b>Jesse:</b> I heard you saying that I should turn myself in.
<b>Diane:</b> Yes! It's the right thing to do. Quit running and get some help!
<b>Adam:</b> No one is trying to hurt you, son! Better you come forward on your own, it'll be safer for you, better all around!
<b>Jesse:</b> Do you remember where we used to have those picnics all those years ago, by the little lake? The one with all the ducks?
<b>Adam:</b> Yeah?
<b>Jesse:</b> Do you think you guys could come get me, maybe?
<b>Adam:</b> We're on our way.
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey, and, uh... It's probably too late to say this. I don't know if it'll mean much to you... But you did your best. And whatever happens with me, it's on me, okay? Nobody else.
<br/>
<b>Neil:</b> Alright. Done
<b>Kenny:</b> Bullshit, you're done. You been here twenty minutes, what'd you do?
<b>Neil:</b> Added a fishplate up here... Welded a metal one down at the end.
<b>Kenny:</b> Added a what?
<b>Neil:</b> Fishplate.
<b>Kenny:</b> What, like a... plate of fish? The fuck is that, is that even a real word? Look, man, I want more of those things! The... sideway diagonal things, like, twice as many!
<b>Neil:</b> Those are gussets. You got enough of 'em already.
<b>Kenny:</b> Okay, yeah, so gussets I got out the ass, but a fishplate I need 'cause, what, I'm Catholic and it's Friday?
<b>Todd:</b> You sure you couldn't just put a few more gussets up there, Neil? I mean, what could it hurt, right?
<b>Neil:</b> Hey, it's your money, but what I did? You don't even need that. I told you, I built this thing right.
<b>Kenny:</b> Fuck, bro, I'm not, like, impugning on your precious welding skills... It's just, we have a, uh... Unique situation here. He tried to rabbit on us once already. I'm thinking he's gonna figure out a way to break this thing.
<b>Neil:</b> You kidding me? Him?
<b>Kenny:</b> Yeah, it's just-- I kinda feel it flexing a little bit. A bit right here. You know? Yeah, yeah, yeah, see? Right there! Yeah, a little bit.
<b>Neil:</b> Mm, I don't see jack shit flexing. That's four inch chain iron up there. You can hang an F-150 right there and shove it back and forth like a beach ball. It's going nowhere.
<b>Kenny:</b> Okay, you and your big four inches. It's just, this little bastard's wiry.
<b>Neil:</b> I don't care how wiry he is. He'll knock himself out.
<b>Kenny:</b> Oh, yeah? Wanna put your money where your mouth is? Fifty bucks says he breaks this thing right here, right now. Fifty plus... Then you gotta put up more of those, uh, whatcha call 'em? Gussets? No charge. Throw in some fish plates, too, while you're at it.
<b>Neil:</b> You're on.
<b>Kenny:</b> I'm on, huh?
<b>Neil:</b> Mm-hm.
<b>Kenny:</b> Alright, alright, get that shit out the way, watch this. <i>[He turns to Jesse.]</i> Alright, good looking. This is it! This is the Acid Test. Go for it. <i>NOW!</i>
<b>Kenny:</b> Go, go, go! Faster, hit it hard!
<b>Kenny:</b> Alright, alright, other way, other way. Hey, what are you slowing down for? What are you slowing down for?! HIT IT! Alright, c'mon, get up, I got fifty buck riding on ya, I gotta eat this month!
<b>Todd:</b> Kenny, if he breaks his leg, he's not gonna be able to cook.
<b>Kenny:</b> What are you, the fuckin' HR Department? Jesus, Toddy, relax. Gonna even up the odds a little bit, alright! Okay... I believe in you! You gonna John Henry this bitch, yeah? Now go. Go, go, go, let's go! Go, go, go, go, go! Yeah! Alright, back the other way, hit it hard! HARD! YEAH! Caught some air... YEAH!
<b>Neil:</b> Todd, who is this guy, anyway? What'd he do?
<b>Todd:</b> Eh, it's a-- It's a long story.
<b>Kenny:</b> He's a rat. That's all you need to know.
<b>Neil:</b> What's up?
<b>Jesse:</b> I need more money.
<b>Neil:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>Jesse:</b> That three way split didn't quite cover it for me. I'd appreciate you helping me out.
<b>Casey:</b> Well, what's he talking about, "three way split"?! You mean there was a <i>third more?!</i> And you gave it to him?!
<b>Neil:</b> It's a long story.
<b>Casey:</b> Wh-- What "long story"?! When I left, he didn't even have a fucking gun!
<b>Neil:</b> Well, he's got one now, doesn't he? So, y'know, shut up. Let me handle this.
Neil, who the hell is this guy?
I can't believe you just let him walk in here with--!
<b>Neil:</b> "Shut up" means everybody. Now... How, exactly, do you plan on pulling this off? I mean, being that there's five of us and one of you?
<b>Jesse:</b> I'm not here to rob you.
<b>Neil:</b> Oh, you're not? Then how's this work?
<b>Jesse:</b> All I need is 1,800. I'm asking as a... a favor.
<b>Casey:</b> Oh, what, like charity? Seems to me this silly son of a bitch already forked over, big time!
<b>Neil:</b> Casey. Seriously, shut up. 1,800, huh? Why not an even 2 grand? Y'know, nice, round number.
<b>Jesse:</b> 1,800's all I need.
<b>Neil:</b> So, what's the gun for? Is it-- Is it, like, personal protection? I mean, is-- Is that a--? What is that? Let me see that thing, show me. Oh, my god, is that a .22? You brought a .22?! Jesus! Where'd you even get that thing?
<b>Jesse:</b> I think it was my grandfather's.
<b>Neil:</b> Aw, well, that's adorable. I think we got a couple empty beer cans around here, if you wanna do some plinkin'?
<b>Jesse:</b> 1,800. I'm gone forever. It's as simple as that.
<b>Casey:</b> Neil, I swear to God, if you give this piece of shit one more dollar--
<b>Neil:</b> Cold out here!
<b>Neil:</b> Tell you what... my third is in a duffel bag on the top drawer of that file cabinet. Where's yours?
<b>Jesse:</b> In my car. Parked up the street.
<b>Neil:</b> What do you say... Your .22 against my .45? Winner takes all.
<b>Jesse:</b> Like the Wild West?
<b>Neil:</b> Yeah. Like the Wild West.
<b>Casey:</b> What? Come on--! Uh--
<b>Casey:</b> Jesus, Neil! C'mon, man, I didn't mean this--!
<b>Neil:</b> Casey. Shut. The fuck up.
<b>Neil:</b> You ready?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah.
<b>Sean:</b> Hey, don't shoot!
<b>Jesse:</b> Alright, get over here. Get up!
<b>Jesse:</b> Alright. Gimme your license. Driver's license, do it!
<b>Colin:</b> I got kids...
<b>Jesse:</b> Like I give a shit. Alright -- Sean! Kyle. Colin. I know where you live. You tell the cops about me, and I am coming for every. Goddamn. One of you. You understand?
<i>[The three of them nod. Jesse gestures to the door with his gun.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Go. Go!
<b>Kyle:</b> Dude, you're on fire.
<b>Jesse:</b> Of course I miss you... Yeah? Well... Do you miss me? I dunno... Are you, um... How are you gonna convince me?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah, bitch!
<b>Jesse:</b> Ah.
<b>Walt:</b> Thank you. 
<b>Jesse:</b> Leave the pitcher, wouldja?
<b>Waiter:</b> Sorry, I can't really do that.
<b>Jesse:</b> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
<b>Jesse:</b> Sure you can.
<b>Walt:</b> Wow. It's like I'm here with Sinatra.
<b>Jesse:</b> I know, right?
<b>Walt:</b> ...certainly went big with the pineapple.
<b>Jesse:</b> What kinda asshole doesn't like pineapple? I'm guessing you don't?
<b>Walt:</b> I could take it or leave it.
<b>Jesse:</b> Pineapple's good for you! It's got Bromine.
<b>Walt:</b> Bromaline. But, close. Actually, it's not close at all.
<b>Jesse:</b> Are you gonna eat? You should really eat something.
<b>Walt:</b> No, I'm-- I'm eating. I'll-- I'll eat.
<b>Jesse:</b> You gotta eat, you gotta hydrate... Get all those electrolytes you were talking about? Your sodium, y'know? All that shit. Hm?
<b>Walt:</b> Yeah, I know. Yep, yep. Yeah.
<i>[Walt takes a sip of water.]</i>
<b>Walt:</b> There.
<i>[He clears his throat, then breaks out into a coughing fit.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Hey... He's alright!
<i>[Jesse stands, then begins patting his back.]</i>
<b>Walt:</b> Fine-- I'm fine! Thank you--
<b>Jesse:</b> You alright?
<b>Walt:</b> I'm fine! Good! Sit down!
<i>[Jesse does, then resumes eating.]</i>
<b>Walt:</b> How long will it take to sell this batch?
<b>Jesse:</b> Six months.
<b>Walt:</b>  "Six"--?
<b>Jesse:</b> Easy, maybe more.
<b>Walt:</b> There's no one you can think of, who might... buy the entire amount?
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh, someone with a spare 1.3 million dollars lying around? No. Can't say that I do. You family is gonna get every dime they got comin' to 'em, Mr. White. No matter how long it takes. Hydrate. Seriously.
<b>Walt:</b> Yeah. What about you, Jesse? Hm?
<b>Jesse:</b> Huh?
<b>Walt:</b> After this, what then?
<i>[Jesse hums -- "I dunno".]</i>
<b>Walt:</b> Nothing? What about... college?
<i>[Jesse lets out a short, sharp laugh.]</i>
<b>Walt:</b> No, what is stopping you from going to college?
<b>Jesse:</b> Um... nothing, I guess.
<b>Walt:</b> Yeah, nothing at all! Say you went to college.
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh-huh...
<b>Walt:</b> What would you study, do you think? What interests you?
<b>Jesse:</b> Sports Medicine?
<b>Walt:</b> Sports Medicine.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah.
<b>Walt:</b> That's-- Yeah, sure. That's-- 
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah.
<b>Walt:</b> Could... Or -- business, hm? Business and marketing. You could practically teach that class!
<b>Jesse:</b> Well, yeah.
<b>Walt:</b> And with a business degeree? I mean, that's handy <i>anywhere</i>.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah. Yeah, I... I guess that could be cool.
<b>Walt:</b> Yeah. You could do it, too. First step, get your GED, that's not a problem...
<b>Jesse:</b> What do I need a GED for? I got my diploma.
<b>Walt:</b> Oh. Oh, of course, yeah, right, right, right, right, right.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yo. You were standing right on stage when they handed it to me.
<b>Walt:</b> Yeah, I know, it just slipped my mind...
<b>Jesse:</b> I totally graduated, high school, dick! No thanks to you!
<b>Walt:</b> We just-- can we just stay on the subject here? Alright? Alright, the larger point being... Y'know what? Forget it, I don't have a larger point, I'm just making conversation.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah.
<b>Walt:</b> You're really lucky, you know that? You didn't have to wait your whole life to do something special...
<b>Jesse:</b> This is Alaska?
<b>Ed:</b> This is Alaska. Forty miles in that direction gets you to Haines. 
<b>Jesse:</b> It's quiet.
<b>Ed:</b> Yeah. Figured you could use some of that. Alright. Date of birth?
<b>Jesse:</b> 6-10-84.
<b>Ed:</b> Mother's maiden name.
<b>Jesse:</b> Stackhouse.
<b>Ed:</b> Where was she born?
<b>Jesse:</b> Kadena Air Force Base, Okinawa, Japan. 
<b>Ed:</b> Father's date of birth.
<b>Jesse:</b> 2-7-51.
<b>Ed:</b> Your father's second-to-the-last job. 
<b>Jesse:</b> Claims Adjuster. Dairyland Insurance. Appleton, Wisconsin.
<b>Ed:</b> What's your Social Security Number?
<b>Jesse:</b> 141-18-6941
<b>Ed:</b> Backward.
<b>Jesse:</b> One four nine six, eight one, one four one.
<b>Ed:</b> Alright... Daylight's burning, you know where you're going... Anything else?
<i>[Jesse holds out an envelope. Ed puts on a glove.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Hold on a sec.
<i>[He takes it and reads it over.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Seal this up, please. I'm going to Mexico City in about a month, I'll mail it from there. Anyone else you wanna say goodbye to?
<i>[Jesse shakes his head "no".]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Not many of us get the chance to start fresh. Good luck, Mister Driscoll.
<b>Jesse:</b> I was thinking about that thing you said, about the universe. Going where the universe takes you? Right on! I think it's a cool philosophy.
<b>Jane:</b> I was being metaphorical, it's a terrible philosophy. I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life. It's better to make those decisions for yourself.
<i>[Hard cut to Jesse looking how we last saw him in "Felina" -- haggard and bearded, driving away in Todd's El Camino, and screaming, happy to be free. His jubilation turns to panic as he notices police lights in the distance. Pulling off into a driveway, he turns the lights off and crouches down near the glovebox, pulling a gun out. A squad of police cars -- presumably the same ones that will find Walter White dead on the floor of the Neo-Nazis' lab in a few minutes -- speed past him.]</i>
<i>[After they have gone, Jesse leans up in the seat, gun still in his hands. After making sure the cops have gone, he sits up and tries starting the car. No luck -- the engine dies. A light turns on from inside the house. Jesse tries turning the engine again. The Camino stalls. A man steps out -- this is his house.]</i>
<b>Home Owner:</b> What are you doing?
<i>[Jesse tries turning the engine. It stalls.]</i>
<b>Home Owner:</b> Hey, what are you doing out here?!
<i>[He tries a final time -- the Camino kicks to life and Jesse pulls out.]</i>
<b>Home Owner:</b> Yeah. Yeah! Get the hell out of my driveway!
<i>[Jesse destroys a mail box before speeding off into the night.]</i>
<b>Home Owner:</b> Better not come back!
<i>[Skinny Pete opens his toilet and flushes several pills down before lighting up a joint and taking a smoke. He flushes it all down, then goes to the television, firing up his video game. Blowing out smoke, he starts playing and talks to himself.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> "I dunno what to tell you. I hadn't heard boo from the dude for nearly a year, I was just happy to see him. I didn't know, like, he was wanted by the authorities. Him and me was just kickin' back when he goes 'Yo, let's trade. My El Camino for your T-Bird.' Guess I should've figured it was shady and all, but, I mean... That Elco's the tits."
<i>[Skinny plays the game for a few moments longer.]</i>
<b>Skinny Pete:</b> "Always wanted me an El Camino. Guess this means I don't get to keep it."
<i>[BANG! The door's kicked open and a second later, a flash goes off in the living room. Cops swarm the house, shouting indistinctly as Skinny kneels and gets on the ground.]</i>
<b>SWAT Officer 1:</b> Give him your other hand!
<b>SWAT Officer 2:</b> Check that hallway there!
<b>SWAT Officer 1:</b> Don't move!
<i>[After taking Neil's duffle bag, Jesse pauses outside the welding shop before running back in. Placing the bag down, he runs over to a gas container and steals it. Some time later, he plops the bag down and adjusts the rearview mirror before pulling away, leaving a tiny, bloody thumbprint. Pulling up his shirt, there's a tiny pockmark in his side -- clean entry and exit wounds. He holds his hand over the injury and sighs with pain.]</i>
<i>[Meanwhile, inside the factory, a blowtorch is jury rigged to blow on the gas can like a dragon, flames licking at the sides like a dragon. Any second now. Any second...]</i>
<i>[BOOM! Behind Jesse, the shop lights up like fireworks rising into the air. Jesse starts the car and pulls away, leaving the smoldering ruins of the shop behind him.]</i>
<i>[A quick time-lapse takes us into day, where we re-enter present time with Ed driving his bean-like Toyota down the street. He takes a sip from his Dunkin Donuts cup before pulling into the shop and opening the rear gate. Through the windshield of Badger's car, we see Ed exit the vehicle and make his way over to an unconscious Jesse, one hand draped limply at his side. Ed surveys the scene a moment, then knocks on the window.]</i>
<i>[Jesse springs awake, pulling the gun in a blind panic. Miraculously, he sees reason -- <u>It's the guy. I'm safe.</u> -- before pain gets the better of him and he cries out, curling in on himself as much as the seat will allow.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> How we doin'?
<i>[Jesse wordlessly reaches for the trunk, popping it open. Ed walks around to the back and looks at Jesse's loot, accepting, before traveling back to the driver's side and opening the door.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Give me the gun, please.
<i>[Jesse's head lolls to the side as he gives Ed a confused glance.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Whatever happens from here on out, you won't need it any more.
<i>[Jesse swallows.]</i>
<i>[A cut later, Ed places the gun inside a duffel bag with the rest of the money and zips it up, also taking Jesse's bag. He walks over to the driver's side, where Jesse is half-leaning out.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Can you get inside under your own power?
<i>[Jesse nods, slight.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Alright, let's go.
<i>[He walks away, leaving Jesse to force himself upright and stumble after Ed.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Alright, first order of business, I gotta get that car of yours off the street and into my shop, then I'll take a look at that wound.
<i>[Ed pulls out his key and unlocks the back door. Jesse makes it over, leaning up against a post.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> So, where am I going?
<b>Ed:</b> Where do you wanna go?
<b>Jesse:</b> ...I can choose?
<b>Ed:</b> No guarantees; I'll do what I can. Where do you wanna go?
<i>[He gets the door open and looks back. Jesse, exhausted, gives no reply.]</i>
<b>Ed:</b> Think about it.
<i>[Ed picks up the duffle bag and walks inside. Jesse collapses on the ground.]</i>
<i>[Jesse drives down the Alaskan highway and looks to the passenger's seat. We cut to...]</i>
<i>[TWO YEARS EARLIER. Jane Margolis looks back at him, smiling. Jesse beams as they drive along a winding road.]</i>
<b>Jane:</b> Nice suspension.
<b>Jesse:</b> Well, it's the Sports Package.
<i>[Jane chuckles.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> <i>[With mock offense]</i> I paid extra for it!
<i>[They both drive along in silence, stealing the occasional glance at one another.]</i>
<i>[Some time later, the car's pulled off on the side of the road. Jesse's on the phone to someone.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Uh, I dunno, y'know, it could be a fan belt? Maybe it's, like, a spark plug thing? Y'know? I dunno, man, y'know, it's gotta be something, right? Alright. Honestly, I don't even. I mean, I can't-- I can't even get the hood open. Alright. Thanks.
<i>[Jesse hangs up and leans against the hood, next to Jane.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Alright, 20 minutes. Sorry. 
<i>[Jane gives him a playful, yet pointed look.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> What?
<b>Jane:</b> So, exactly how much did you hate that today?
<b>Jesse:</b> I didn't, like, <i>hate</i> it.
<i>[Beat.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Seriously! Y'know, museums are, like, my... my bag. My <i>bag</i> bag. Mainly, I was... I was thinking about that thing you said, about the universe.
<b>Jane:</b> What thing did I say about the universe?
<b>Jesse:</b> Y'know, going wherever the universe may... take you? I dunno. I think I could be down for that.
<b>Jane:</b> ...You're not about to propose marriage, are you?
<b>Jesse:</b> Yo, as if! I mean, c'mon--
<i>[He stands, gesturing to the foggy landscape around him.]</i>
<b>Jane:</b> Because a broken down Toyota Turcell... kinda least romantic setting ever.
<b>Jesse:</b> Yeah, I know! Duh!
<i>[His laughter tapers off and he wanders back to her side.]</i>
<b>Jesse:</b> Seriously, though. The going with the flow, where the universe takes you... Right on! I think it's a cool philosophy.
<b>Jane:</b> I was being metaphorical, it's a terrible philosophy. I've gone where the universe takes me my whole life. It's better to make those decisions for yourself.
