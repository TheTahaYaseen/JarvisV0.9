<b>Narrator</b>: The first hazard for the returning hero... is his fame. The adulation can spin you quite giddy. Those who once dismissed you as a lousy pork chop... now claimer just to being your presence.

- Show us the pig !
<b>Narrator</b>: The deeds of the farmer and his remarkable pig... became renowned even in distant lands. Invitations came from all over to open fairs, to demonstrate sheepherding... and, indeed, to meet a queen. But Arthur Hoggett was a retiring man. He found his best pleasures working his farm. And so it was, one morning he set out to repair the water pump... and Babe somehow got it into his head that he could help. But fate turns on a moment, dear ones, and the pig was about to learn the meaning of those two cruel words of regret: "if only." If only he hadn't been so careless; if only the weight of the pig and the pump did not exceed the weight of the farmer; if only the farmer did not connect with the platform on the way up... or jam his fingers at the top; if only the pump hadn't fallen off at the bottom; and if only the poor farmer had the presence of mind... to hold onto the rope.
<b>Babe</b>: Boss? Boss!
<b>Narrator</b>: At no other time in his short life... had the pig wished more that his words could be understood by humans, if only to say, "Sorry, Boss."
<b>Babe</b>: (Whispers) Sorry, Boss.

<b>Narrator</b>: Even before her Arthur's misfortune, Mrs. Hoggett was ceaselessly busy... bustling, baking, bottling and pickling, but now, having to nurse her husband and pay the bills, she found life considerably more challenging... than she had ever anticipated. Before long, two men showed up. Two men in suits. Men with pale faces and soulless eyes. Such men could have come from only one place: The bank.
<b>Mrs. Hoggett</b>: Arthur! Arthur! [ Muttering ] Where is it? Where is it? Where is it? [ Gasps ] Yes. "Dear Mr. Arthur Hoggett... [ Muttering ] "...guest appearance for your pig. [ Continues Muttering ] ...sheepherding demonstration." Sheepherding demonstration? "Free air travel, accommodations... and a generous appearance fee." Oh! Arthur! Arthur! A generous appearance fee! Look! See? See? Pig! Pig! Pig, pig, pig! Pig! Pig, pig, pig. Pig? Pig, pig, pig! Pig! Pig, pig, pig!
Come, dear.
You're being called.
<b>Mrs. Hoggett</b>: Pig!
Uh, he's not here.
Pig, pig, pig, pig!
Babe.
<b>Babe</b>: Babe's not here.
You can't undo what's happened, son, but you can make up for it.
Babe, the boss is about to lose the farm.
We'll all be sent away.
There's no telling where we'll end up.
[ Horse ]
Not every human is as kind as ours.
But what can I do?
Nothing!
You're a sheep-pig.
A champion, no less.
- [ Mrs. Hoggett ] Pig!
- Most likely they'll want you to herd sheep.
<b>Ferdinand</b>: You can't leave. He can't leave! You're my lucky pig.
<b>Mrs. Hoggett</b>: [ Angrily ] Pig! Pig! Arthur! You call the wretched thing.
<b>Mr. Hoggett</b>: Come, pig!
[ Hoggett Whistles ]
<b>Babe</b>: Well, I must be off, then.
You won't be alone, dear.
You'll be with the boss's wife.
Oh, sure, the boss's wife. You'll be in the company of a serial killer.
Do not take counsel of your fears, lad.
- Do you want to pee before you go?
- Uh, no, thank you.
Come on. Come on, pig.
[ Ferdinand ]
B-B-But I need this pig.
He's my lucky pig, my good luck pig.
W-W-Without him, l-I'm dead.
Deceased ! Lifeless ! Extinct !
A demised duck !
In you go.
Can you come with me, Fly?I wish I could, dear, but it's you they want.
- Please?
- Stop it, now. You're a brave pig.
And, Babe, more often than not in this uncertain world, fortune favors the brave.
Porridge in the morning. No sugar.
A little bit of salt, but not too much.
Tea. No milk, just lemon.Okay, I think that's everything.
Right. I'm off.
Esme?
Don't worry, Arthur. I won't let anything happen to your pig.

[ Narrator ] Of course, it was proved beyond any doubt... that Esme Cordelia Hoggett was not a felon.

- [ Mice ] ~ Are you lonesome tonight ~
- Sad to say, the thing between the pit bull and pink poodle didn't last.
She ran off with another dog and left him with the kids.
Come on, kids, you got to be scary. You're warriors. Give me your snarl.
Pups: But, Dad, do we have to? We don't want to.

~ ~ [ Continues ]
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ When I kissed you ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ And called you sweetheart ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Do the chairs in your parlor ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Seem empty and bare ~
<br/>

- [ Narrator ] As for the orangutan, he insisted on staying at the farmhouse... with Herself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ And picture me there ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Is your heart filled with pain ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Shall I come back again ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Tell me, dear ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Are you lonesome ~
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~ Tonight ~ ~
[ Narrator ] And finally, dear ones, the pig and the farmer... were content again in each other's company. And things were back to where they started, more or less.
Hmm.
[ Pipe Rattling, Thumping ]
That'll do, pig. That'll do.
[ Sighs ]
A kind and steady heart can make a grey sky blue
And a task that seems impossible is quite possible for you
A kind and steady heart is sure to see you through
It may not seem like very much right now
But it'll do, it'll do
When you find yourself in the middle of a storm
And you're tired and cold and wet
And you're looking for a place that's cozy and warm
You'll make it, if you can never forget
Kind and steady heart, can conquer doubt and fear
A little courage goes a long, long way
Gets you a little bit farther down the road each day
And before you know it
You'll hear someone say, "That'll do, Babe, that'll do"
A kind and steady heart, is sure to see you through
A little courage goes a long, long way
Gets you a little bit further down the road each day
And before you know it
You'll hear someone say, "That'll do, that'll do, that'll do, Babe, that'll do"
<b>Mice</b>: Thank you for staying till the end. Bye-bye.
