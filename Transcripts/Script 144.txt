Good morning, Daddy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Ben, how you doing, man?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, God.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy's got to get ready for work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't you stay home?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. I got a real big day at work today.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kim.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where's my cell phone?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's with my crayons.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not supposed to be with the crayons.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There you go, sweetie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, has anybody seen my beeper?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here it is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right by the grape juice.
I wonder how it got there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are those my note cards
that I've been working all night on?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been up all night
and now they're all sticky.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, baby.
Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bye-bye.
Yeah, I'll see you later.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget about the orientation today.
The what?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chapman Academy? The preschool?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Right.
Is there any way we could reschedule that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we shouldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should take care of business
and be responsible parents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't be late.
I will not be late.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Promise?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I won't be late.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See you later.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did he promise?
He sure did.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your worst nightmare.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Broccoli's a no-show.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He got a call-back
on a potato chip commercial.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These snack foods are killing us!
Yeah, I know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marvin!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The guy who smells the mail?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We need a guy to wear a broccoli suit,
not a normal guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marvin, my man!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My friend, Marvin. What's going on today?
Listen, I need a favor.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're having a focus group
and the broccoli guy left.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you'd put the suit on
and cover for us?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can't do the broccoli
because it's just not me. Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I be the carrot, though?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, you could be the carrot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let him try your carrot on.
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll be the broccoli.
I don't want to be a bush.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a bush, it's a stalk.
A strong stalk of broccoli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm pretty strong.
You can make that work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's switch this suit and get the broccoli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Trust me on this. Let's go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BR-O-C-C-O-L-I!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am the broccoli and don't know why!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
CA-R-R-O and a T!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Carrots are healthy for you and me!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to do the dance?
Go Broccoli, it's your birthday!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go Carrot, go Carrot, go!
No, I don't want to.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, boys and girls!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zowie! Do we have
a special treat for you today!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hey! We have a brand-new cereal!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"You're the first kid"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's super yummy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And loaded
Phil, help me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with all sorts of stuff that's good for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And do you know what we call it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Veggie-Os!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This cereal sucks!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're turning on us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give it a chance. Let it get in their mouth.
They got to taste it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take that!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help me, Charlie!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not in the face! Save yourself, Carrot!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Call security now. Stop that!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess we better go in, Pooch.
Your Daddy will come a little later.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come here, let me see you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry, baby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Things got crazy at work.
What's going on, man?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at this place.
It's Princeton for preschoolers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's hurry up
so we won't be late for the orientation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's the orientation about?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a preschool,
they'll be playing with blocks, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unbelievable.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Language skills are a critical component
here at Chapman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're part of our core curriculum.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You must be Charles.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Call me Charlie. Nice to meet you.
How do you do?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my wife, Kim.
Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kimberly. I'm Miss Harridan,
the headmistress.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this is Ben.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you do, Benjamin?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on, little man.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shall we begin?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at their outfits. I like that.
They're cute.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We find uniforms reinforce
the sense of structure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Structure's good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With structure to cling to,
and the right gardener to tend them
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
they'll grow to the sky.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
So, Mrs. Hinton
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you're returning to work?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lawyer, I believe your file said.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I haven't practiced yet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just had Ben when I finished law school.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still a little nervous about leaving him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All mothers are. But you needn't worry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our little seedlings are in very good hands.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Turn the darn phone off.
It's off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And attack!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now mark your books, number five.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cat is to mouse as frog is to
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are they doing SAT prep?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's never too early to start.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nest.
That's right. Nest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought you turned your phone off.
It's not my phone, it's my two-way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is bad.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Thank you, baby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am terribly sorry.
I have an emergency at work. I gotta go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand.
I'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, little man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy's got to get going,
but I'll see you later on, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to do the rocket ship?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's do the rocket ship.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about all the noise.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here you go. Go to Mommy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you later. Thank you for your time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm so sorry.
He's trying out a new product at work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No need to apologize.
Diligence always sets a fine example.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jenny. Just in time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a copy of our curriculum
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and a list of your financial obligations.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the price per year?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Per month.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ben is starting preschool today.
Where at?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Over at that Chapman Academy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Marine Corps of day care.
Max goes there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really? What do you think of that place?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There isn't much choice.
You got Harridan and her merry fembots
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or Idiot von Idiot and their School
for Children Who Like Accidents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Numbers just came in
for Chocolatey Chocolate Balls.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Through the roof!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's a surprise. You hear that?
Kids like chocolate.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ice cream, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I forgot I was talking to the granola-heads
from the natural food division.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What was the stinker you got saddled with?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a stinker.
It's Veggie-Os, the cereal of the future.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right, Veggie-blows.
I thought they were killing that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jerry!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The numbers on the Chocolatey Chocolate
Balls are through the roof!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What does he mean, "killing that"?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why you listening to Bruce?
Nothing's being killed. He's a clown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If something was going down, we'd know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're killing it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on, Jim. We had one bad test.
It's a hard nut to crack.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any fool can sell
Chocolatey Chocolate Balls
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and cotton candy-flavored cereal to kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cotton candy. That's not bad.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guys, look. I'm sorry, but it was a dog.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kids just don't want to eat vegetables
for breakfast. Who knew?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I told you that six months ago
when you put us on this project.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You did?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not just Veggie-Os.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're shutting down
the whole health division.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's like     people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not a business we want to be in.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where are we being reassigned?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pooch, how was your first day at school?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know anybody there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give it some time. You'll make some friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How was your day, baby?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I lost my J-O-B.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You lost your J-O-B?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got F-l-R-E-D.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me and     other people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They cannot do that!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't Jim Fields do something?
He's the one that pulled the trigger.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's not gonna do anything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I found out it was him,
I told him to take a flying
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
H-l-J-K-L-M-N-O-P.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in demand,
and I'll have a new job in a week.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What if we use the emergency fund?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can't.
We already used it on the car payment.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's no way around it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We gotta pull Ben out of Chapman.
It's too much money.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What will we do for child-care?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you gonna stay home with him?
No, I'm not gonna stay home with him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just gotta find something
more affordable, that's all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the right address.
You gotta be kidding me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can at least check it out.
Ben is not going here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks can be deceiving. I'll go look.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks can be deceiving?
We're in a trailer park!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for the preschool.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Touch of Eden Preschool.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I help you?
No, thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the right address, here?
I think so.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We keep the children right around here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead. After you, ma'am.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where'd you get this address?
You picked this place.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We should report this to somebody.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's what I'm talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I knew there had to be
at least one decent place.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It looks all right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the police.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have you surrounded.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, Charlie. Give up the keys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know where the keys are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't even try it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you drive the minivan?
No. We talked about this last night.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're staying home with Ben.
I'm driving the Mercedes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have me driving around town
in the dumb minivan all day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is the top down?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what, Kim?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be careful. Don't just park it anyplace.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be careful getting in and out of the car.
Don't get any dings in the door.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Make sure you put good gas in there.
If you put in the cheap stuff
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the engine will start knocking,
and I don't want that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't leave milk in the car
with the windows rolled up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Always buckle up the car seat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't park in the sun
or the seats will get too hot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And no juice unless it's in a sippy cup.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bye, baby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you give a call,
tell us what time you'll be back?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because we'll be here waiting,
just the two of us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bye, Mom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not too fast!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See you later.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When's Mommy coming back?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She'll be back around dinnertime, Mommy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is dinnertime soon?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, but don't you worry.
We're going to have a lot of fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we need Mommy to have fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you trying
to just break me down in the driveway?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why you want to break your father down?
I'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's better. You broke me down smooth.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My eyes welled up.
I'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You made my eyes well up.
Okay, let's
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at my eyes.
I see your eye twitching.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're going to have fun!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how to change a diaper?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but I thought Max was potty-trained.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, so did I.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't do that to me! What are you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's throwing things at me, and it smells.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really need your help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you potty-trained?
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got to go stinky?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, go on. Go stinky, then.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have a nauseous ache in your stomach
that you're a worthless failure?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are worthless failures.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Peggy. How you doing?
Good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on, Nicky?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He can be a little hard
to understand sometimes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Honey, go play. Have a good time, have fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stay away from that cat poop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Hija"? What'd he just say?
God, I haven't a clue.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The doctor says it's just a phase, but
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It kept him out of Chapman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jerks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put that mouse down!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give it to me!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie, I think it's great,
you guys being full-time dads.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're real giants among men.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are. You should be proud.
Most guys don't know who their kids are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joe still hasn't found anything?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, and he's driving me crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I should go back to work,
but what about Nicky?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dead mouse.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's no good alternative to Chapman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone opened a decent day care
program here, they'd make a killing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nicky, what did I say about the cat poop?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A day care center? You and me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a completely underserved market.
Harridan has a monopoly on this suburb.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All we have to do is come in
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
establish ourselves as the value alternative,
and we'll clean up!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You think I'd be good at child-care?
Absolutely.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me? Are these your kids?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember when you broke my yo-yo?
I did not break your yo-yo.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you did.
I did not break your yo-yo.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your yo-yo was broke.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're killing me. You're really killing me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm home!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You said let's do this together.
No, Daddy!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A day care center. In our house?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Phil's apartment's only
a two-bedroom place.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is crazy on    different levels.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you both know about
running a day care?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not rocket science.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We applied for a license.
It couldn't be any more simple.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy.
What you want? The rocket ship?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's what you wanted, right?
Milk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wanted milk? I'm sorry. He wanted milk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Rocket man needs milk when he's flying.
It's for strong bones, in case you crash.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We understand each other.
What you think about this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're talking about other people's kids.
Do you understand that responsibility?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be just as careful with them
as I am with Ben.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't be rubbing your head into stuff.
Watch where you're walking.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What about when you get a real job?
Just leave the parents hanging?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll cross that bridge when we get to it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It won't be permanent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We won't get rich from this,
but it might keep us out of bankruptcy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, Charlie.
Come on, Kim.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can't just sit around here.
I got to try to do something.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. I need this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess you better start
handing out those fliers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It makes much more sense
Me, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, you want me to give you a hug?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's a big hug. Group hug.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. When you get a chance
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here you go, Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, little karate guy.
Daddy Day Care, karate girl.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello! Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, how are you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here you go. If you get a chance
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you get a chance,
have a look at that. Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it's not too much trouble,
when you get a chance
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Warm, nurturing, experienced parents
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"providing exceptional child-care
at affordable prices."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The "experienced" part
is what I have to take issue with.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I give it three days.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You two guys are running
a day care center?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're signing up people
at a lemonade stand on the front lawn?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with that. Come on, Paul.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait. Don't you believe in equality
amongst the sexes?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't men do everything women can do?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, we can't. It's unnatural.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Little bit eeky.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're guys?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What did you think Daddy Day Care meant?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe one guy. Not only guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just thought it was a clever name.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the day care place?
They're all guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're what?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Listen.
We are two loving, caring parents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We run a day care center.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're a couple of sickos!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about a free trial offer?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sickos!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear.
Come on!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Peggy! Hi, Nicky. How you doing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nicky is so excited for his big day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How old are you? Oh, yeah, five.
I got it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait. You're leaving Nicky here
with these guys?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have trouble with them being guys?
Are you from the Dark Ages?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you for gender equality
and all that jazz?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peggy, come on. Of course we are.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So can't women do what men do
and men do what women do?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These guys can do the job.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll vouch for these two?
Yeah, I'll vouch for them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll try it.
You're doing it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll have a great time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.
Right, kids?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're a real lifesaver.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You screw this up,
I'll kill you with my bare hands.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here, now, go to Phil.
No, I don't want to go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Let go.
I don't want to go!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's got a little bit of separation anxiety.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dylan!
I don't want to go!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just stopped breastfeeding.
I'd freak out, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lf you could grab a leg.
I don't want to go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
Here we go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here we go.
Come on, Dylan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, sweetie.
I don't want to go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Let go of Mom!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Oh, man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

So cute.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maltodextrose.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or yellow dye number two.
Two, right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His name's Crispin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My man, Crispin!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How's it going, big guy?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What time's pickup?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At  :  .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have laser treatment. Make it  :  .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry about the outfit. He won't take it off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How long has he been wearing that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Couple of weeks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who will you call if there are any problems?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's such a good girl.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. I'll let you hold my keys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about a Life Saver?
You like Life Savers?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about money? A dollar?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A dollar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are a smart man. That is yours.
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're your team facilitators.
My name is Charlie and this is Phil.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anybody ever seen
a mission statement before?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here. Everybody take one.
Take a mission statement.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here we go. One for everybody. Slow down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right. Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who wants to be first one
to read the first sentence
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on the mission statement?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, how about you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't read yet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm looking for someone who can read.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By a show of hands,
how many of you can already read?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Raise your hand
if you don't know how to read.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's what we'll do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll read the mission statement aloud
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and what I want you guys to do
is just follow along as I read it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Doesn't that sound like interesting fun?
Here we go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"As the members and facilitators
of the Daddy Day Care team
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"we will collectively strive to provide"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sean, don't eat the mission statement.
Get that out of your mouth.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"will collectively strive to"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't rip the mission statement, Little Flash.
It's an important document.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come back here!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What he's really trying to say is
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop running!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want the rocket ship?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One more?
Rocket ship!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody'll get the rocket ship.
Slow down, everybody.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought you said this would be easy.
You know what I'm thinking now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was a huge mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never quit anything in life,
but I'm not sure if I can take this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right back.
Where you going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help me do the rocket ship.
Trust me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Four absent children. No explanation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it's just a coincidence.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a group this size,
three absent children is a coincidence.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Four is a statistical anomaly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Santa Luma!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Santa Luma!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody! It's Big Phil with a guitar!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you guys enjoy Big Phil
while I rest my spine?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Max, bring your dad a chair.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They really like that rocket ship.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was a small boy
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
at the age of five
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
my mama said
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd be the greatest man alive
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a man
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a full-grown man
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a fat man
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, come on into the kitchen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put the lime in the coconut
and drink 'em all up
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put the lime in the coconut, drink 'em all up
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put the lime in the coconut
you drink 'em all up
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I say, "Doctor,
ain't there nothing I can take?"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I say, "Doctor, to relieve this belly ache?"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I say, "Doctor"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like a rhinestone cowboy
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Riding out on a horse
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in a star-spangled rodeo
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hava nagila, hava nagila
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hava nagila
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am definitely out of songs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lunchtime.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know
if we should be feeding them this stuff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not? Look at them. They love it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but I'm a little worried.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About what?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He tore off his head!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crispin stole my doll. I need help.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know how old this piano is?
Keep your feet off the piano.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get your shoes off the couch.
Get them off the couch!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crispin. Please!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give me the
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The meat ain't the only fresh thing
around here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't play with that. Give me this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Leave it alone, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You get off those drapes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop climbing the drapes. You stop it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You come here!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give me the vase!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put down the vase!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, we give them all organic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, it'll be okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How can you say that? Look at this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What goes up
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You guys are good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you expect?
You left your kids with professionals.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to leave you hanging.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since we got laid off,
Sheila's made me make dinner.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really? How's that going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It ain't napping.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I take these snack cakes home?
Go ahead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How you doing, little man?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's how you doing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me a second.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give me that. That's too loud.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let go, it's too loud.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm serious. Let go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's late. Where's your mom?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shut up, butthead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shut You stop that.
You know something?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your mommy and daddy
would not like you talking like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When your mommy comes,
I'll tell her that you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's go. Motor's running.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get out of here. Hey, I wish you would.
Stop, Crispin!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't make that face.
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't make lines. Quiet the face.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Relax the face. Quiet the face.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, calm your face.
Show no lines, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got early drop-off?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, we don't have anything
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to see you tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll see you tomorrow, Crispin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll be just like your father.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at him.
Hanging off of him, his skin. Hanging off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, little man.
Hey, Dad.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you up to?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just trying to read a story.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen, man
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know I was really busy today
taking care of those other kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know it probably wasn't easy for you
sharing your toys
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and watching Daddy
do rocket ship with everybody, but
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's just us,
we can do whatever you want to do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can we read this story?
We sure can read this story.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"There once was a herd of elephants.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Elephants young, elephants old,
elephants tall and short, fat and thin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"All were different, but all were happy,
and almost all were the same color.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"And they all made the elephant sound."
They all said
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me hear you make that sound.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do it again?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I can't do it again,
because Daddy might have an aneurysm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, guys, sorry I'm late.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not cleaning this up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, take this in there. Go sit down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I haven't had my coffee yet,
but it seems like these kids are multiplying.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, we got two new kids.
Oh, come on!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll have to up our game.
We need structure and planned activities.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, we need Ritalin and leashes,
that's what we need.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All we'll need is this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody, let's do this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody, come in here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's try another play. Let's try this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's try this. Here's what we'll do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This new play's called the Baby Blitz.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want you to hang back and do a lateral.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want you to go down the middle
for a buttonhook.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I want you to be my blocker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about we just run in a circle?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can do that. That's an even better play.
Everybody run in a circle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes? All right, let's run in a circle.
Come on, run in a circle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony, you'll see the ball a lot better
if you take your mask off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not Tony, I'm Flash.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How come you're not playing, little man?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on, it's football. You love football.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help! Stuck!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I live in California.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where do you live?
I am in Hong Kong.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where's Hong Kong?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you hear me now?
I can't hear you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you hear me now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought you liked football.
You're telling me you don't like
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right back, little man. I got to go
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got a little problem over there with Max.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's happening.
What's happening? What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lt! It's happening.
He hasn't gone for a week. That's it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no. That's It's happening?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's happening. I know the face. Look.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got to go and deal with that.
I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, you can't?
I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on, you have to do it.
I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can.
I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you can.
All right, I will!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good. Come on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen. I see you got issues about this
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so I'll take care of it this time, all right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the future, you got to work it out.
I got to work it out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's your son. God willing,
when you get older, he'll do this for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So you want to know he owes that to you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He owes me.
He owes you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't get cute with the thing.
I'm not assuming you're doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So how you want to do this?
I can do this myself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You sure?
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, you go and do it
with your bad self. You go and do it now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right. You need anything,
I'm right out here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, big guy, how'd it go in there?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I missed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I missed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, hell, no.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on!
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. Put this down.
You don't play with this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you ripped up my wife's flowers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give me this. You're not supposed to.
Go play with something else.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on here?
It's spiraling out of control.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't panic. They're like animals.
They can smell fear.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know what to do.
I've run out of ideas.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll tell you what
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quietly, children. Follow me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Six absences.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Single file.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have to go make a phone call.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's get ready
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to rumble!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something,
I have never liked carrots.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And today as I stand here
and look at you before me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
having the audacity to think
that you can defeat me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
let me tell you something, brother,
I am about to kick your carrot butt!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something, Mr. Broccoli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When The Carrot is done with you,
you will be nothing but a kumquat!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will destroy everything in this world
that is broccoli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The carrot is the lowest form of vegetable!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What about me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nobody likes broccoli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really? Well, Ben likes broccoli, don't you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You turned my own sprout against me?
Now you're gonna die!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, come on. I felt that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Will you stop it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's that about?
I'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You made me crazy!
You little maniac!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're wrecking my wife's tables.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody's at the door.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this the Hinton residence?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm Dan Kubitz, Child Services.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm here to conduct
a compliance inspection.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No one said anything about any inspection.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We only do it if we receive a complaint.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A complaint?
Somebody complained about
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on in. You can inspect us.
We have nothing to hide.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You caught us at a crazy time.
We're playing with the kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Somebody complained about us?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, where is the nap area?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The nap area?
Right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don't have a nap area.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just let them fall asleep
wherever they drop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Sleep where they drop."
Well, I think that should just about do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's the bottom line?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you need to correct
the deficiencies on this form.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And also
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you need to fill out
these compliance certification documents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who wants these, the carrot or the broccoli?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Carrot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's a lot of stuff on here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we can stay open, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As long you've done that by  :   a.m.
Tomorrow morning.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with this.
I like what you're doing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd hate to be the guy to shut you down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'd hate for you to be that guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will be. Don't want to be.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Safety gates
at the bottom of the stairs
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
top of the stairs, bedrooms, bathrooms.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've gone safety gate crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How many kids have we got?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've lost track, they run so fast.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can get started on this batch over here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's getting late. Let's just call it a night.
We can't call it a night.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got a bunch of kids coming
in five hours.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm serious. We know nothing
about running a day care center.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We don't know anything.
We're not even good parents!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a good parent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean?
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That thing. What is that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know that rocket ship thing you do?
Ben doesn't even like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That just happens to be Ben's favorite thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He lets you do it because you like it.
It's the one time you pay him attention.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't change your kid's diapers.
I don't like diapers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should teach your kid
how to go to the toilet and aim
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so we don't have to redecorate the place
when he goes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me tell you something.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid is   years old,
and for the first time today
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw him playing with the other kids,
just being a normal kid.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It felt great knowing
I had something to do with it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We did that!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If we can do that, we can definitely
get this place up to code by dawn.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's go safety gate crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry, he'll be fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's all right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All I got is $ .
I can break that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen, I left the paperwork
on the kitchen table. It's not there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me you have it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't have it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, guys.
Marvin, what are you doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The door was unlocked.
I got your final paychecks here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, what's going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't even ask.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can understand him?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, he's speaking Klingon.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's Klingon.
I thought the kid was an idiot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
God, how much "Star Trek"
does that kid watch?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too much.
The guy from Child Services is here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
No, listen. Why don't you do me a favor?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you take the kids in the back
and play with them?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Keep their attention for a while,
while I talk to this guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do, don't let this big bruiser
get near the lawnmower. Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kubitz. Hi.
I thought I was early, but
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was just getting the paperwork.
Great.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You dropped something.
Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The kids wanted to help out.
That's sweet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So here's everything for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I'll need is your signature
on the back of her head.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And on the elbow of this kid.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a pen?
I do have a pen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my lucky pen.
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And where's on the
Initial the elbow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sign the back of her head.
On her neck?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great. That should just about do it.
Here we go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're ready to roll.
Let's go in and get started.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, you know,
everything looks okay here
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but it says here
that you now have    children.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's correct.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I assume that you've hired
a third care provider.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why would you just assume that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, section     of the Child Welfare Code
specifically states
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that the ratio of children to care providers
cannot exceed  : .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The    .  .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ratio thingy.
We resolved that this morning.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good.
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We hired someone. We hired Marvin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marvin was hired! He's with the kids.
He's an excellent child-care worker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd love to take a look,
if that's okay with you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to go out there?
It'll be good for me to see for myself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's go and have a look at Marvin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, put your hands up. Now, wave them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He certainly seems like
he knows what he's doing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've got to say that.
Yeah, we interviewed a lot of people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it was a really long, grueling
singling-out process.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And now, I'm a chicken.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bird. Look, I'm a bird.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can never be too careful
when it comes to kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here at Daddy Day Care we'll only work
with the best, so we got Marvin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What did you do to these kids?
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are they on drugs?
Well, there's this one kid, maybe.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How'd you get them to behave like this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Got to know how to handle them.
How do you know that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I read
"Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care" book.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not about "Star Trek".
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finish.
Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, when I was in the back
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I spotted, under the eaves of the porch
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
what looked like a beehive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A big one.
Don't worry. All taken care of.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want anybody getting hurt.
No hurt. Gone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You really have turned this around.
Thank you very much.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm impressed. I really am.
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For our own curiosity
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
any chance you could
tell us where the complaint came from?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really would love to,
but I have a relationship with the state.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just for our own curiosity.
That was Miss Harridan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure she'll see us.
We need to talk to you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry. They just barged right in.
That's quite all right, Jenny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Gentlemen, please sit down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, what can I do for you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We wanted to thank you for helping
to expedite our accreditation process.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to your tip, somebody
from child services came to see us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had heard you opened
some sort of day care program
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and I was concerned.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's nice of you.
You don't have to be concerned about us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's not you I'm concerned about.
It's the children you're looking after.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait a minute. We're parents. That's a start.
Any boob can be a parent.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you want to screw up your own child,
that's your right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But when it comes to other people's kids,
there's a higher standard to answer to.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kubitz seems to think that we met
that standard. Show her the thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That piece of paper doesn't impress me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're getting it laminated.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You two are just some fly-by-night
operation looking to make a fast buck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're just afraid of the competition.
Let's go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Competition? Don't flatter yourselves.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy Day Care will never be
in the same league as this institution.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Laminated!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That wasn't as satisfying as I thought.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think we can take her. All we need
is some garlic and a wooden stake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what she said that was right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These kids need more than watching.
Tomorrow we'll take it up a notch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got to start stimulating their minds.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I'm not a daddy.
You don't have to be a daddy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're a male-type humanoid.
That fits in with the philosophy of the place.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know, guys. I mean,
I guess I like hanging out with the kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's kind of cool.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I guess child-care wasn't necessarily
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
an avenue that I felt professionally
I was headed towards.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's exactly what I said.
Excuse me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, come on in!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How are you?
Hey, guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am so sorry.
I forgot to write you a check this week.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the divorce,
my head's just been like
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you the new daddy?
I'm your daddy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not your daddy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm your baby's daddy. I'm not
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm not your baby's daddy.
I'm going to be
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're Marvin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's nice to meet you, Marvin. I'm Kelli.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dylan's mom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got to run.
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right. Bye, guys.
Have a good one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
Bye.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm in. Do you have a dental plan?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your first assignment is to show us
how you handle kids the way you do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teach us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this were a business,
and they were customers
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
how do you find out what they want?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd put together a focus group.
All right, let's do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'd like you to tell us what you'd like
to get out of Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'd like you to tell us what you'd like
to get out of Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help us to help you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who'd like to start?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We need more learning about things.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More learning about things?
Yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're at a very critical age.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have to feed our minds.
All right. You want to write that down?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Feed our minds."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great. Okay, what else?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dolphins. Dolphins are good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dolphins are fish.
No, they're not.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They live in water.
That doesn't mean they're fish.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Calm down and talk about something else.
What else would you like to talk about?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where do babies come from?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's go back to the dolphin subject
and discuss dolphins
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or if there's anything else
on someone's mind we can talk about
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
other than that.
Write that down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, what else?
Could we
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What were you going to say, Ben?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can see you were going to say something.
What is it, son?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
drawing?
More drawings?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah! Like pictures and stuff. It's really fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, yeah, great. More drawings.
Yeah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More chasing bad guys.
Excellent idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can chase Joker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, wait a second, buddy.
That's Batman's bad guy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're Flash,
so you want to be chasing
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lex Luthor?
No. That's Superman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to be chasing Captain Boomerang,
Gorilla Grodd, Reverse Flash.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Riddler?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What have you been doing to these kids?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Starting tomorrow, Phil will be hosting
a Three Stooges film festival in the TV room.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know everybody's looking forward
to that, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Daddy!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last but not least, the Thumb Suckers
Support Group will have a meeting
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
under the tree after nap time
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
which starts right after
you finish your snack.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So after you finish, grab a blanket,
get a spot, and we have that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, next week is going
to be Alpha Girls Group.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And we're going to have
Tai Chi under the tree.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And we're going to also have pet day,
so you bring your pets in.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll have pet show-and-tell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my bunny. His name is Tiny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I feed him a lot. Five times a day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He poops a lot, too. Six times a day.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's like little marbles.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my turtle, Sparks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's fast. He's the fastest turtle in the world.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go! Go, Sparks!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my parrot, Paulie.
I'm teaching him to talk. Talk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shut up, butthead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Becca, where's your pet?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a tarantula,
but I don't know where he is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, all right, don't panic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, don't panic?
There's a big spider in here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I got a spider on my head!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So what are we betting on today?
I'm going to do a diaper stroke, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if it isn't the geniuses
that brought the world Veggie-Os.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, how's unemployment?
Actually, I've got the best job I've ever had.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it's a start-up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We offer time-management facilitation
to mostly working professionals.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's a tough market.
Sounds pretty cutthroat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. It's a real blood sport.
What's the money like?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bruce! Let's go, I got Botox.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Charlie. Hi, Phil.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, Crispin.
What's up, little man?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you know my kid?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're his day care teachers,
what do you think?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Day care? That's what it is?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God.
You're wiping boogers for a living.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Losers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're paying us to do it, too, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Losers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Do you like green eggs and ham?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I do not like them, Sam-l-Am.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Would you like to eat them here or there?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I would not like to eat them anywhere.
I do not like green eggs and ham.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"I do not like them, Sam-l-Am." Okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now see, he was going to punch Sam-l-Am,
but he walked away.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't punch, see?
He walked away with it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where's Mommy?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mommy had to work today.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember when you used
to work all the times?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, back when I had a real job.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you miss work?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess. I suppose so. I miss it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But don't get me wrong. It's not like
I don't like hanging out with you guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's just that Daddy used to be
a big shot down at work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had my own office and a big, pretty view.
Remember that big, pretty view Daddy had?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like it when you spin me around
in that cool chair.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, that's a cool chair.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A lot of cool things about that job.
Cool chair
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had people working underneath me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and, just between you and I,
the pay wasn't that bad either.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put that down. What do you think of that?
What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean?
It's a dog in the sunshine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It doesn't look like one.
That's because it's abstract.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have to squint when you look at it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And when you see it like this,
that's abstract.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah? You see it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about if you tilt your head to the side?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, the other way.
Still doesn't look like one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, well, what are you over there
working on, Michelangelo?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's nothing abstract
about that now, is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's pretty good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got Daddy's head
looking kind of round, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is my head that round?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. But I got your mustache.
Yeah, I see. A nice green mustache.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's all right, son.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just paid the mortgage,
the car loan and the electric bill.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look at the balance
in the checking account.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. That's right,    cents.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are my Superman.
You got that right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've worked hard, and I think
it's time to let off a little of my frustration.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's time for you
to take care of your Superman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My Superman. Come here, baby.
That's right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No! The monster's going to get me!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's probably a nightmare.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be right back.
Okay, hurry up. Mommy's coming!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I want Daddy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did everything go okay?
Yeah, everything's just fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's that face for?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since when does he like you
better than he likes me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, don't even trip. It's not like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've just been spending more time with him,
so he wanted me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's getting much more confident.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember how he wouldn't play
with anyone else at first?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, he's even playing with
that kid, Crispin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Crispin happened to say "thank you"
at lunch today without being told.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that little girl Becca, she can read.
She's just a baby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I seen her pick up a "Curious George" book,
sit down and read like a grownup.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's that face?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I haven't seen you this excited
about something in a long time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I ain't going to front.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Them little crumb snatchers
got under my skin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Plager, I cannot continue
to expose the other children
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to such dangerous, self-destructive,
highly addictive behavior.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So either Juliette stops the thumb sucking
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or you'll just have to find
yourself another preschool.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you busy?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just pruning a few weeds from the garden.
What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, I just thought you should know
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we've lost three more students.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you seriously suggesting
you don't know where they are?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, ma'am.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know where they are.
So do I.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, it was amusing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then it was annoying.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now it's really starting to tick me off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get me a copy of
"Child Day Care Services Regulations".
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Phil, get the door.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get the door!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, I got it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kubitz. What are you doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is this a bad time?
No, it's a great time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is the man of the house at home?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Man of the house."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie! Mr. Kubitz is here
from Child Services!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll be right there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, let me ask you. Where are the kids?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Outside. Marvin's giving them
a puppet show.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nice. What's on the program? "Pinocchio"?
"Little Red Riding Hood"?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, "Wrath of Khan".
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kubitz. Hi!
Hi.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait! What are you doing?
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong with your face?
My face?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's all that stuff, man? Come on.
What's the matter with you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Becca and Jamie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you'll excuse me,
I have to see two little girls
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
because now I'm a big girl.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's having fun with
Mr. Kubitz, so what brings you here today?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've received another complaint
I guess we know who that came from.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you've acquired
three more children since my last visit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. We're    altogether now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's still three adults,
so we're still under the  :  ratio.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right. But you see,
it's a totally different issue this time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie, can I talk to you for a second?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Kubitz, excuse me a second.
I'm going to go handle this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a cookie.
Sure. Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's up?
Flash is gone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean, gone? Gone where?
I can't find him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You looked everywhere? In the garage?
Everywhere.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What we going to do?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is there some kind of problem out here?
Not at all, Mr. Kubitz.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're just having a little conversation
about the
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, because if it's
No problem at all. Why don't you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kids! Why don't you meet
our good friend, Mr. Kubitz.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Say hi.
Hi, Mr. Kubitz.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi, guys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't it be nice
if Mr. Kubitz played with you guys
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
while we had an important conversation?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you be so kind?
Is that a good idea?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're having a grown-up conversation
the kids shouldn't be privy to.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So just for a second. Please.
Sure. That's different.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll check the back yard.
I'll go upstairs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll check the basement.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do we have a basement?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have to do the laundry. God!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God! They vaporized him!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't have got far. I'll call the police.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll call his parents.
Lf only I were a Betazoid, I could sense him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Which kid is this?
I don't know. What's your name?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Flash's name is Tony.
Actually, Flash's name is Wally West
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why aren't you wearing your Flash suit?
I don't want to be Flash anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't? Who you want to be?
Tony.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hear that? He wants to be Tony.
He wants to be Tony.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's nice. You want to be Tony.
That's great.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tony, have a cookie. Have a fresh one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about? I do love you.
I'm just not in love with you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you talking about? I do love you.
I'm just not in love with you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fifteen months of therapy,
that's the best you can do?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is the dumbest line I have ever heard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother was right about you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For what? You think this will change?
You think I'll change?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You think this is what I had in mind?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Being a   -year-old man,
living with his mother?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You think that's my idea of a good time?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love passive-aggressive losers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to state regulations,
a child-care center in a family home
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is limited to a maximum of    children.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have plenty of room here for these kids.
I don't make the rules, I enforce them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can't have more than    kids
at this kind of location.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if we want to stay in business,
we have to fire two kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unless you want to move to a permanent
facility somewhere else, then yes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, who do we cut loose?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about Becca and Jamie?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can't do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got to do something.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't we get a bigger space?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Space. The Final Frontier."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm serious. Harridan said we're not real.
Let's get real.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's get a bigger space, more kids,
hire more people
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and give this woman a run for her money.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great. Let's get a new space.
Yeah, Final Frontier!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don't stop with that "Star Trek",
I'll push you in that sticker bush. Stop!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No! I'm saying that there is a space available
called "The Final Frontier."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This used to be my home away from home.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jerry, the guy who owned this place,
had the ultimate collection of memorabilia.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what he had? Tricorder.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That Ensign Riley wore
in "The Doomsday Machine".
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. I never saw that episode.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was with him, not watching also.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Needs a lot of work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That just means we can fix it up
how we want to fix it up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But we'll need some money to do that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To make money, you got to spend money.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To spend money, you got to have money.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Rock for Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Help us finance our new permanent home."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know what this means?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a chance to improve ourselves
through a little healthy competition?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, you bubbleheaded idiot.
It's a death sentence.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If they get their hands
on a big enough space, they'll ruin me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're selling fun. I can't compete with fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I should've crushed them
in the beginning when they were weak.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It'll be harder now, but I have no choice.
I've got to stop them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How are you gonna do that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By any means necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, ride the pony.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pet the goat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get a T-shirt made. Something to eat.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the music!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're showing "Logan's Run", Friday
Friday night at  :  .
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you're not busy Friday nights
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
maybe you'd like to
Yeah, sure.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So we're talking, like,
just dinner, bath, bed?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The works?
What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want me to baby-sit
so you can go to the movie, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marvin, I want you to go with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Great.
All right. Here's your thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much. Okay. There you go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't think we should do this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, my dear, in life there are
winners and there are losers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to be a winner,
sometimes you have to play dirty.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll show you. I'll paint my face first.
And then you paint yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See? Put a little paint.
And I'm just going to
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's not paint! It's glue!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Could I have some more
of this delicious potato salad?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have you tried it? Really. It is so good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's up?
Look.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And they got into everything
except for the pies.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, but don't panic.
We'll just sell the people pies, that's all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Goats really love pie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Leave them on for two hours.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You got it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody just take a deep breath
and let's go back to having fun.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How'd we do?
We haven't even put a dent in it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello?
Charlie, Jim Fields.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How's your vacation going?
No, I'm just pulling your leg.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen, buddy,
are you still looking for work?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've got a job for you,
unless you've got other offers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, that's really interesting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I've got something going on right now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before you say no,
let me fax you over the proposal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can take a look at the numbers,
you think about it
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
then you get back to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.
Okay. Great.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You say hi to the wife and daughter Son.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me guess. You couldn't get
child services to come back
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so you're doing the inspection.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I apologize. I don't like to be sneaky.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still, rules are rules.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
May I come in? I've a proposition for you.
Yeah, please do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I get you some coffee or tea or water
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or eye of newt, maybe?
Water would be lovely.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.
Water. That's an easy one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't mind tap water, do you?
We're out of the bottled water.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, Miss Harridan, why are you here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You seem smart, talented, highly ambitious.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What on earth are you doing
running a day care center?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I enjoy running a day care center.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obviously. But is this really how you want
to spend the rest of your life?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a businessman,
you'd have money, power, respect.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You going to throw that all away
to baby-sit a bunch of  -year-olds?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I said I'd listen to your proposition.
I'm all ears, and I got other things to do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if you'd be so kind
All right. Here it is:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If Daddy Day Care should close,
for whatever reason
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll take all your children
for the price you charge.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Topflight education at rock-bottom prices.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Think about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now wait a minute.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're blowing us off
for Cottony Cotton Balls?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, Cotton Candy Puffs.
Apparently the whole thing was my idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll double my salary
and let me run the division.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, I am taking myself back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go ahead,
if that's what's important to you. I mean
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Phil and I can manage.
We'll just find somebody else. Right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm going, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is worse than
when Spock betrayed Kirk
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on "Star Trek V".
It's not like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come back with us. Not in the mailroom,
but to be part of our team.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't want to be on that team.
I want to be on this team.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We thought a lot about this, man.
It's a great opportunity.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, this right here is a great opportunity.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This business is the one that has limits.
And we've reached them, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Me and Phil,
we got responsibilities to think about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We got futures to take into consideration.
What about now? What about the kids?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These kids were fine before Daddy Day Care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll be fine when it's over.
You tell yourself that, Charlie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I finally found a place where I fit in
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
where I feel like I'm doing something good,
and you guys just
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You just spoil it all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That couldn't have gone worse.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you think that went bad,
wait till we tell the kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can I go to work with you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, you can't go to work with me,
but you can come visit me at work.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Daddy will be home at night
and on the weekends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll still have lots of fun together.
Will Phil and Marvin still be here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I'm sorry, little man.
They won't be around anymore.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's just for a while, right?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then you're going to come back
and do Daddy Day Care again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, this is from now on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Daddy Day Care,
we're not doing that anymore, Ben.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me explain it to you like this:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If Daddy does this, I can get money for us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I can use that money
to take care of the house and to buy food
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and clothes and toys for you to play with.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll sell all my toys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why you want to sell all your toys?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I don't have toys, we don't need money,
and you can stay with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was that simple, Ben.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The development department will have
the first samples ready by next week.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, let's kick it around.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of
when you think of cotton candy?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clowns.
Chocolate.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cavities.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hyperactivity, cavities, and dentist bills.
That's what I
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I've been to the other side
and I've seen firsthand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When kids eat this stuff, they crash down
so hard they need an air bag.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what
the ingredients are to these balls?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Puffs.
They're "puffs." I'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what's in here?
Red dye number four and sugar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what? Charlie is absolutely right.
You can't ignore the reality.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Parents are not going to want to buy
this product for their kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not unless those kids stomp and scream
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and bang their little heads on the floor
till blood comes out of their ears.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie, you got those figures
that I gave you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I got them right here.
Just give me a second to
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had an independent marketing firm
do some preliminary research
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
to sort out the core value of this product.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The subjects that were tested,
aged two to six
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
which are key branding years
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charlie, you want to join us?
I'm sorry about that, Jim. Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you tell everybody
what the core value is?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's the most important thing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kid, Jim, that's the most important thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I think I've made a tremendous mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And so, I quit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing to me? You scared me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How was the marketing meeting?
I quit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What?
I quit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You quit?
I quit and I feel great.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should quit with me.
I should quit?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should quit right now.
We just got here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You want to feel how I'm feeling?
Quit. Come on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quit!
Quit with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You weren't going to sell the carrot suit,
were you? The kids love that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This stuff
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is not for sale!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A literal reader of the text might say
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A literal reader of the text might say
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
that Goldilocks ate the "porridge"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
because she was "hungry."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But what would Freud say?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Language skills are a critical component
of childhood development.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're part of the core curriculum
here at Chapman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you'll follow me this way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the path of life,
the proper first steps are essential.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With our firm guidance, your children
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
will take those steps right here at Chapman.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our philosophy is that
a child is like a climbing vine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With structure to cling to,
and the right gardener to tend them
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
they'll grow to the sky.
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're not talking about plants,
we're talking about kids.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know you don't want this woman pruning
and cutting and weeding your  -year-olds.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people are uncomfortable
with achievement.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, what I'm uncomfortable with
is treating a little kid like it's an adult.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If your kids come here, they'll be
miserable in four different languages.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Five. We start Portuguese in the fall.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How many languages
do you listen to them in?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You ever stop trying to shove knowledge
down their throat and just talk to them?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen to what they want.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're children,
they don't know what they want.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they do know what they want.
All of them. And they're all different.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We took some time, talked to the kids,
got to know them a bit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It made a difference. It helped them.
Please. Share your success.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you tell these people exactly
how you help their children?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Max over here is potty-trained now, okay?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't miss.
That's right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Becca learned how to read.
Yes, I did.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Crispin is the most polite kid
you'd ever want to meet.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Charlie.
You are most welcome, Crispin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I made friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's right, little man,
you made some friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As of this moment Daddy Day Care
is back in business.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't be a fool. You won't make a nickel.
We might not get rich, but we'll manage.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Any boob can run a child-care center.
It takes a family to raise some children.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're going to be a family from now on.
Family? What a laughable concept!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll just laugh our way down the driveway.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a pleasant day.
Bye, Miss Harridan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on! Let's go!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get in there! Come on! Let's go!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on! Hold up!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everybody's holding hands, right?
Right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Daddy Day Care."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, how could you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's a really great place to work.
You should apply there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Or not.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day, Miss Harridan.
That's nice.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help! Stuck!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, here I come.
What's going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'm stuck!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Loser.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Loser.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Little man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'd say this wasn't a bad tradeoff.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, Dad.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, action.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can spend You know, we can't spend
money without having it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hold on one second.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What, are you being beamed up?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's Captain Kirk.
It is!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Action.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing to me?
Pudding on my hand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, wait a minute.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would never push you in a sticker bush.
You couldn't push me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I'd use a shovel on you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Busy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some other kids around here
hanging out with you. How that sound?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
See, you going to have to work on it.
"Mazel tov".
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember when you broke my yo-yo?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I broke
And you never gave me a new one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's why you sent me to bed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You've been writing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, I can't even write my letters.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're killing me. You're really killing me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Joe Frazier's Smokin' Skillets!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These skillets were made
in the City of Brotherly Love.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's a good thing.
Okay, Eddie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They gave you
a little too much direction, didn't they?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, stop before you pee on yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is my line?
"I'll sell all my toys."
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll sell all my toys.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I'll say my other line over again,
because I messed it up. I say, "You"
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Action!
Okay, thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let it go for a second. There.
Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's why I know
we haven't been to the moon.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Miss Harridan says
it's preparing me for my future.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You hungry?
Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you feel like eating?
A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don't know.
After this scene.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I give you
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's so funny?
