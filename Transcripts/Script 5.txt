<b>Dr. Pavlov</b>: Your client wants out of prison, Mr. Torte... and with my behavior control therapy... freedom is... I have patented a humane cocktail... of electric shock treatment... Aversion therapy, hypnosis... drugs... And plenty of green vegetables.
- But, of course, the real challenge remains. I mean, this is a prison, not a pet shop. And I don’t represent animals in court.

Oooh-hoo-hoo-hoo!
Brush up your Swedish, Dr. Pavlov.
This could be your Nobel prize!
Cruella De Vil.
Do call me Ella. Cruella sounds so... cruel.
Ms. De Vil, I am releasing you into the custody of the probation office.
You will perform 500 hours of community service.
Mr. Torte, your client is, I believe, a wealthy woman.
After my exorbitant fees, milord.. her assets stand at a mere 8 million.
Then you will be bound over to keep the peace to the sum of 8 million.
If forfeited, the money will be donated... to the dogs homes of the borough of Westminster.
Which means, if you repeat the offense… your entire fortune will go to the dogs.

Cruella De Vil's probation officer. Oh! She’s in the back. [Men Chattering] Is there some problem? I mean, uh… Excuse us, Chomp. - I mean, Miss De Vil, she seems devoted to… - [Wolf Whistle] Nice bird! - You are a nice bird. - I’m not a bird. He means you. Where are your manners? - Buried in the yard with my bone. - This is… - Um… - Chloe. Chloe Simon. Chloe, meet Waddlesworth. - He’s a rottweiler. - Hello. - That’s funny, because he looks like a macaw. - [Barks Fiercely] Trust me. He’s a rottweiler. I don’t think I trust anyone who knowingly puts Cruella anywhere near dogs. Well, yes, but she’s changed. - People like Cruella don't change.
- Of course they do.
That's why I started Second Chance...
I knew what it was like to need one.
And the same goes for dogs.
Eh?
[Barking]
Take Chomp here, for example.
He chewed through three postmen before I rescued him.
Now he wouldn't hurt a flea. And Digger, he was banned from every park in London as a menace to roses. And Drooler...
Well, Drooler hasn't really changed much.
- Those are dogs.
- Oh, but dogs are people too.
- But Cruella is...
- Changed.

Surprise!
[Cackling]
Earlier than I planned, but c’est la vie.
- I hereby revoke your probation.
- And I hereby lock you up. With St. Kevin of Assisi in the clink, it just wouldn’t do... if three more puppies were reported missing. - Three more? - Good-bye, my dear. - [Cackling]
- No! I’ll think of you every time I wear your sweet little doggies! - No! - [Cackling Continues] Stop! [Barking] [Sinister Laughing] Ooh, not bad. The English can do the knitwear.
- [Barking]
- [Grunts]
[Barking]
Shh!
Be quiet!
[Horn Honking]
[Snores]
Ooh!
Hey, what’s that?
Listen.
Hey.
- Do you hear that?
- What? What is it?
Uh, best I can make out, they're all yappin' about "tubble."
Tubble?
Oh, trouble.
Must be puppies talking.
Listen.
Hey, wait.
There's more.
Uh, "widdle ones"?
"Bad man gwab widdle ones. Twee potted doggies."
Potted?
Twee widdle potted… Bad man grabs three little spotted doggies. Oh, my gosh. Chloe’s dogs. [Growling] Aah! Aaaah! Oh! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! [Moans] The puppies! [Gasps] Thank you, Fluffy! [Waddlesworth] [music] Go to sleep [music] [music] Go to sleep [music] [music] Go to sleep little guardie [music] [Sighs] Dog, James Dog. Aah! [music] Go back to sleep [music] [music] Go back to sleep stupid guardie [music] [Sighs] Taxi! - St. John’s Mews, please. - You know, I could get five to ten for this. That’s 35 to 70 in dog years. Ow!
[Quiet Sobbing]
They’ve gone.
- Where are they?
- Calm down, calm down.
[Growls, Barks]
- Whoa! - Aah! Hoo! Aaah! I’m so sorry. I should have trusted you. No, I should never have trusted Cruella. - With my police record...
- It doesn't matter. Yes, it does matter. Look… I broke into the lab and freed those dogs. They were being used for experiments. That was your dognapping conviction? Yes. - That’s all? - Yes. What’s this? "The Orient-Express." - Paris. - [Barks] They’re going to Paris! Come on!
[Cruella] Oh, Jean-Pierre, you’ve outdone yourself. I am the Napoleon of the fur, and you are my… - Waterloo? - My Josephine. Together we’ll… Aaah! A rat! I need spotted puppies, you idiot! But it is not a rat. I know rats! - It’s a "poopie." - Alonzo! - Yes. - Find the rat and kill it. - LePelt and I will be on the Orient-Express. - K-Kill? The last time I underestimated a puppy, I wound up in the pokey! - Go! Go! - Why not him? Oh! Yes, I see. Thank you. Ahh. There. [Barking, Whining] [Barking Continues] Yaah! [Grunting] [Dog Yelping] Oh, oh. Ohh! Ohh-ohh-ohh-ohh! [Gasps] - Excuse me. The Orient-Express? - Platform nine. Paris! City of Lamour! Of la mode! - Of LePelt! - [Both Cackling] [Barking] [Barking, Whining] [Whimpering] - [Grunts] - LePelt, with his slippery Frenchman ways. She’ll see. She’ll see that I’m the loyal one. - Alonzo. - Oh, joy. Le petit homme. - You took care of the rat? - [Ice Cubes Rattle] You will never… see it… again. [Bell Dinging] [Kevin] This isn’t the Orient-Express. - [Waddlesworth] We’re on the wrong platform! - There she is! Come on. Oddball! Oh, no, I can’t look! She’ll be killed! [Yipping] Somebody, do something! Oh, what am I doing? Help! Help! Your wings! Flap your wings! Flap wings? Oh! Where did these come from? Blimey, they work! I can fly! Dogs can fly! [Barks] Whee-yah! I just realized I’m not a rottweiler at all! I’m a retriever. - [Yips] - [Barking] [Whining] [Clattering] - Where are we going? - Paris! - We’ve missed the train! - Then we’ll catch the next one! You think he saw us? We better… We better hide. But where? - What? Bad wady’s cow? - [Barking] Oh, good idea, spotty. [Whistle Blowing] - Vive la Paris! - Careful now. Careful. Careful. Uh, careful! Mustn’t harm the "poopies." [Chuckles] [Tires Screeching] [Horn Honking] The p-poopieman gets to ride in the c-car. Is Alonzo keeping up? The little man is too slow. This traffic is too slow. The French are useless behind the wheel!
[Cruella Laughing]
[LePelt] Aah! You're going the wrong way!
- They're going the wrong way!
- [Horn Honking] We're going to die!
[Horn Honks] [Whimpering] - [Screams] - Shut up, Jean-Pierre! - [Bicycle Bell Dings] - [Tires Screech] Jean-Pierre, our next challenge: Reinventing the poodle skirt. [Woman Complaining In French] [Dogs Barking] - Nothing. Nobody saw anything. - Oh! [Dog Barking In Distance] I didn’t know you spoke French. [Horns Honking] Come on! Come on! Taxi, stop! [Horn Honks] So what did they say? - [Barking] - Follow les chiens.
[Waddlesworth] It's spooky, all right… but you’d have to be a sniveling, whimpering, cowardly little Chihuahua… not to barge right in there and take charge of the situation… with no hesitation at all. After you, then. Ohh, I'm gonna regret this. What do you look at? Work! Work! - Illegal immigrants? - Of course. Hmm. How much? - Fifty francs a week. - Oh. [Chuckles] That's not much. It’s all they can afford. Sure hope you know where you’re going, pup. - Bingo. - [Barking] Don’t worry, Oddball. I'll have 'em out in a jiffy. [Grunts] Hmm. Tastes like chicken. [Panting] [Whimpering] Ooh. It’s no good looking at me like that. It won’t do any good, you know. Sorry. [Hatch Closing] - [Door Closes] - [Whispers] Okay. Go right through.
Did you hear something?
It's just your little man outside.
- [Barking]
- Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh!
Hey, I thought I told you to wait outside.
Hey. I know, but they were worried.
Oh!
Hello!
Hi!
Okay, let's get them out of here.
- Come on.
- [Cruella] Well, Miss Houdini.
Aren’t you in a tight spot?
Ooh, what fun to get away with murder! Ta-ta! [Cackling] [Cackling Continues] I'm really beginning to dislike that woman. There's got to be a way out of here. - Hello, nice bird. Aah! - Aah! Waddlesworth! Is Oddball with you? You bet she’s here. She’s commando leader. - Now, pass up the pups, quick. - Okay. One. Have a seat. Two. Good, good. Join the other one. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. [Sewing Machine Engines Whirring] One hundred. In a bunch. Come on. In a bunch. One hundred and… Are you 100 or 101? - Great. Now we have to start all over again. - That’s it. Bring me the "poopies"! Come on! This is my favorite part. The skinning? Not the strangling? Ah, I like the strangling also. The mark of a great furrier, Alonzo, is that he does his own strangling. - Remember that. - Thank you. Shh. [Sniffing] - Wha... - [Alonzo Grunts] Aaah! It’s the little rat! You lied to me. M-M-Me? Why should l… Ugh! Does she look dead to you? Does she? You worm! I'll kill her myself. You are a wormy little man. Oh! [Grunts] Aaah! [Growling] [Angry Grunt] Whoa! Oh! You’re both idiots!
[LePelt Laughing]
[Waddlesworth] Aah! Excuse me! Work! Now I crush you, little man! - [Chloe] Aaah! - [Growling] [Workers Chattering Excitedly] Who’s the little man now? [Growling] Aaah! [Workers Cheering, Laughing] [Panting] I’ll wear you on my sleeve. Here, puppy, puppy. Puppy. Sweet puppy. Uhh! [Yipping] [Gasping] Oh! Oh! - [Alarm Blaring] - [Whistle Blows] - [Buzzer Buzzing] - [Gasps] Oh, oh! No! Aah! Aaaah! Ugh. [Clucking Sound] Oh! Oh! Oh. Aah! Oh! Aah, aah! Ohh! Aah! Aah! [Motor Speeding Up] Aaah! Aaah! - Quickly! To the bakery! - But can we trust him? Now is not the time to count your change, Kevin. Come on! She’s after the puppies! [Gasps] I’ve got you now, you little rat! [Frustrated Grunting] - [Buzzer Buzzes] - [Cackling] Oh. [Cackling] Without spots, you’re just not worth the trouble. Chop, chop. And now to my coat! [Oddball Barks] [Screaming] [Chloe] Domino! Little Dipper! - Oddball! - Oddball? Where are you? Come out, come out, wherever you are! [Bell Dings] [Gasps] Ahh! [Blubbering] [Low Bark] Aaah-aah! Oh!
(A Dalmatian kicks Cruella out the door and she landed in the window display. Sometime later, the Dalmatians scurried out as the police carried Cruella out of the bakery.)
[Chloe] No, Alonzo. Cruella will always be Cruella. Hope springs eternal. What's that puppy doing up there? - No, Oddball! - Oddball! Oh, Oddball! Ohh! - What have you been up to now? - What have you been doing? Hey! Hey. Ohh! Dirt. Kevin. Look. These won't come off. She’s got her spots. Oddball’s got her spots! Look! [Dogs Barking]
