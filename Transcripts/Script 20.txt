<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
Look, I'm going to be paying off
these student loans until, like, 2003.
<br/>  
Hey, you want to get out of here?
<br/>  
-What a rager, huh?
-Yeah. Yeah.
<br/>  
Isn't it weird that all this,
<br/>  
this all happened
at the end of the semester?
<br/>  
You and me.
<br/>  
James...
<br/>  
I don't think I can see you anymore.
<br/>  
You don't... What do you mean?
<br/>  
Sorry.
<br/>  
Women are mercurial, man.
<br/>  
-And you did just start dating last week.
-It was 11 days ago.
<br/>  
You didn't tell her about the Scarlet V,
did you?
<br/>  
-That has nothing to do with it.
-Oh, Christ. Brennan.
<br/>  
-What?
-You did! You promised me!
<br/>  
Look, I don't lie to people
who I care about.
<br/>  
Yes, but you could've just left it
out of the narrative. You know?
<br/>  
You don't want "virgin"
to be your signifier.
<br/>  
He takes one semiotics class,
and I'm supposed to...
<br/>  
Here, drink up.
<br/>  
You need to bed down the next lonely,
plain-looking, insecure depressive
<br/>  
who throws herself at you
and get it over with.
<br/>  
Look, I know most people
have low standards.
<br/>  
I guess I'm... I'm different.
<br/>  
Well, you know what,
we'll find you a girl, all right?
<br/>  
-When we're on the Continent.
-Here's to sexually-permissive cultures!
<br/>  
Yes! Focus on Europe.
<br/>  
It's going to be
a transformative experience.
<br/>  
To the graduate.
<br/>  
Yeah, so I researched
some more youth hostels,
<br/>  
and the median cost
is just a little higher than I expected,
<br/>  
about $7.68 more,
<br/>  
multiplied by the 42 days is $322.56.
<br/>  
Bill, do you want to take this?
<br/>  
Excuse me, can you get me
a refill here? That's an old-fashioned.
<br/>  
So with the $I have from Grandpa's trust fund,
<br/>  
plus the $900 you guys
are already giving me, thank you,
<br/>  
I do need an additional $279.11.
<br/>  
James, we didn't want
to spoil your graduation,
<br/>  
but your father has been transferred
to a different department.
<br/>  
Really? Is that... Is that bad?
<br/>  
Yes, we're making less,
considerably less.
<br/>  
Because this trip
was my graduation present, so...
<br/>  
Sweetie, I am so sorry about this trip,
but I'm afraid we just can't afford it.
<br/>  
You could still help me
with rent next year, right?
<br/>  
All right, James,
you're not listening to me.
<br/>  
-Here you go, sir.
-There we go. Thank you very much.
<br/>  
Listen, here's to you, kiddo.
Happy graduation.
<br/>  
Wait. What am I going to do
about grad school?
<br/>  
You know,
Columbia's holding a spot for me.
<br/>  
Well, if you end up deciding
that's what you want to do,
<br/>  
then obviously
you're going to have to get a job.
<br/>  
A summer job?
<br/>  
Summer in Pittsburgh.
<br/>  
-That's fucking harsh.
-It's a nightmare.
<br/>  
They don't like people like me
where I'm from.
<br/>  
You know, we're romantics.
I read poetry for pleasure, sometimes.
<br/>  
Hey, yeah, well, you know what,
don't worry about it, all right?
<br/>  
You know, with my dad's connections,
we'll get a great deal on an apartment.
<br/>  
And, hey,
I'll float you for the first few months.
<br/>  
-Yeah?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-Thank you so much, Eric.
-Hey, don't worry about it.
<br/>  
What the hell are you doing?
Our parents are right over...
<br/>  
What, them? They're clueless.
<br/>  
Fuck, this is good weed.
<br/>  
Speaking of which,
I just want you to know
<br/>  
that you'll be with me in spirit
this summer.
<br/>  
-Hey, put that away.
-Yeah. Take it.
<br/>  
-No.
-Take it.
<br/>  
-Take it!
-Okay.
<br/>  
Look, James,
I know things suck right now, all right?
<br/>  
But look at it this way,
<br/>  
in a few short months,
you'll be with me,
<br/>  
in New York City,
the greatest fucking city in the world!
<br/>  
Like we always talked about, man.
Living the adventure together.
<br/>  
Quit worrying, Brennan.
That's what the weed is for.
<br/>  
Bill, for God's sakes, pay attention.
<br/>  
All right, I'm just trying to drive.
<br/>  
Here she ever comes now now
<br/>  
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now
<br/>  
Here she ever comes now now
<br/>  
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now
<br/>  
Oh, it looks so good
<br/>  
She's made out of wood
<br/>  
Just look and see
<br/>  
Here she ever comes now now
<br/>  
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now
<br/>  
Here she ever comes now now
<br/>  
She ever comes now now
She ever comes now
<br/>  
Oh, it looks so good
<br/>  
She's made out of wood
<br/>  
Just look and see
<br/>  
I really haven't had that many jobs,
per se,
<br/>  
but here are my academic records
and my extracurricular activities.
<br/>  
I wrote for The Gordian Knot,
it was a literary journal in college.
<br/>  
And in math, I got 770 on the SATs,
<br/>  
so I assume I'd be good
at tabulating checks.
<br/>  
These are the only jobs
you've ever had?
<br/>  
No, no, I also spent several years
<br/>  
taking care of a neighbor's lawn,
the Palmieris.
<br/>  
I have their
letter of recommendation here.
<br/>  
All right. Fill this out.
I'll call you if anything comes up.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
No, I've never actually
driven an asphalt mixer, per se,
<br/>  
but I did once drive my friend's van
to Wisconsin
<br/>  
on a pretty lengthy road trip.
<br/>  
Yeah, so... Okay, is there any way
I can take a lesson...
<br/>  
They hung up.
<br/>  
What am I supposed to do?
I'm not even qualified for manual labor.
<br/>  
The only place I know I can get a job
is with Frigo.
<br/>  
What, at Adventureland?
<br/>  
You got a concussion on the
teacup ride there when you were 6.
<br/>  
-You can do better, kiddo.
-No, there's nothing.
<br/>  
I majored in Comparative Literature
and Renaissance Studies.
<br/>  
Unless someone needs help
restoring a fresco, I'm screwed.
<br/>  
Oh, for God's sake, Bill.
<br/>  
-Nad attack!
-Frigo, Frigo! Hey, get off of me.
<br/>  
-Brennan, come here.
-Frigo, stop. Okay.
<br/>  
There's the lawn mower, lawn mower,
lawn mower!
<br/>  
-Yes!
-Frigo.
<br/>  
Oh, Brennan!
<br/>  
Right here, sir! Right here, sir!
Have a funtastic time!
<br/>  
I don't have much work experience,
per se, but...
<br/>  
I'm sorry.
<br/>  
Paulette? Come in, Paulette? Bobby?
<br/>  
Bobby?
<br/>  
-Paulette, come in, Paulette?
-Channels.
<br/>  
-You just... You gotta press it.
-Oh, they're gone.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
This is James,
and he's applying for a games job.
<br/>  
Games! Oh, great, good.
Let's get you set up.
<br/>  
Actually, Bobby, I'd prefer a rides job,
if it's still open.
<br/>  
You look more like a games guy,
<br/>  
plus I've already got out
the games application, so... All right?
<br/>  
Okay. Yeah, no. I just...
<br/>  
My name is Bobby.
<br/>  
Okay, rules. No freebies,
no free turns for your friends,
<br/>  
-no free upgrades, no free food.
-So, just nothing is free here.
<br/>  
Everybody has to pay for everything.
<br/>  
And more importantly,
working in games,
<br/>  
no one ever wins a giant-ass panda.
<br/>  
Yeah, we don't have that many left.
<br/>  
Cool? Can you hand me
a T-shirt, please?
<br/>  
Here, I have a resume. I don't know
if you still want to take a look at it.
<br/>  
James? Am I pronouncing that right?
<br/>  
-James? James?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Okay, by accepting this T-shirt,
you are...
<br/>  
Hired!
<br/>  
Well, usually I...
<br/>  
-More of a ceremonial thing, the T-shirt.
-Sorry.
<br/>  
Okay, new guy, let's get this over with.
<br/>  
Here we are
at the first of many shitty games.
<br/>  
This one is inexplicably
called The Flighing Dutchman.
<br/>  
Even more inexplicable
is how they decided to spell it.
<br/>  
Hey, Jerry.
<br/>  
$1 buys 5 rings.
<br/>  
If one of the rings lands
on one of the red bottles,
<br/>  
they win a giant-ass panda.
<br/>  
-That is a giant-ass panda.
-Yeah, it's the best prize in the park.
<br/>  
And that's because this game
is un-winnable.
<br/>  
Observe. I'll drop a ring
from 3 inches away.
<br/>  
So nobody ever wins?
<br/>  
If someone wins a giant-ass panda
on your watch,
<br/>  
you should just go home
because you're fired, okay?
<br/>  
So the object of the game
<br/>  
is to knock the hat off the dummy
with a softball,
<br/>  
except, as you'll see,
half the hats are glued on.
<br/>  
-Really?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
I mean, we pay little Malaysian kids
10 cents a day to make these toys,
<br/>  
we can't just give them away.
<br/>  
You get a 5-minute bathroom break
every 2 hours.
<br/>  
I recommend saving a few of those up
in case you have to go number 2.
<br/>  
Brennan, they got you working on games?
<br/>  
What a pussy! You're such a pussy!
<br/>  
-You know that demented person?
-Yeah. He used to be my best friend.
<br/>  
Then I turned 4.
<br/>  
So if you stand
directly below the hoop,
<br/>  
you will see that it's been hammered
into an oval shape.
<br/>  
But from back there,
the sucker just can't tell.
<br/>  
Jesus, that's so wrong.
<br/>  
A criminal abuse
of the laws of perspective.
<br/>  
Yeah, well,
people are getting ripped off.
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, Trotsky,
let's get you a booth.
<br/>  
So your life must be utter shit,
or you wouldn't be here.
<br/>  
I was supposed to go to Europe,
<br/>  
but my family has money problems.
<br/>  
Wait till your parents start
making you pay rent.
<br/>  
My dad even makes me pay utilities.
<br/>  
I don't want...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
Hey, litterbug! In the clown mouth!
<br/>  
Okay, we have a winner.
It's the purple horse.
<br/>  
Green's in 2nd. Yellow's 3rd.
Congratulations.
<br/>  
Here you go. You can have that.
<br/>  
-Hey, James?
- Yeah?
<br/>  
You think you can maybe, you know,
take it up a notch?
<br/>  
Yeah, I know. Maybe I'm not
the right guy to run this game.
<br/>  
I really... I think I should probably be
on the rides department.
<br/>  
No. No, no, no.
You're more of a game guy.
<br/>  
-No, you're very... You're very gamey.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.
<br/>  
Have you ever seen
a horse race before?
<br/>  
Have you ever, like,
heard one on the radio?
<br/>  
Harness racing
or, like, the normal kind?
<br/>  
-That's a good question.
-It doesn't really matter.
<br/>  
Look, the Kentucky Derby.
Have you seen the Kentucky Derby?
<br/>  
The way they announce it on the radio,
and it's really...
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
"100, 200, 200, going..."
<br/>  
-That's an auction, sweetie.
-Right.
<br/>  
So don't...
Yeah, just get into it, you know?
<br/>  
Make it a show. Make it a performance.
You know what I mean?
<br/>  
That's what people come for.
<br/>  
So, let's take it to a 10.
All right, got faith in you, man.
<br/>  
Thank you.
<br/>  
-Take it to a 10. I like that.
-Okay.
<br/>  
Ladies and gentlemen,
put down your mint juleps.
<br/>  
Horses are all at the starting gate.
<br/>  
Okay, and they're off!
<br/>  
And Red bolts out of the gate,
taking an early lead!
<br/>  
But look out! Here comes Green,
<br/>  
issuing a challenge
from the outside lane.
<br/>  
Green runs well
on a muddy track, folks,
<br/>  
so today's conditions
give him a slight edge.
<br/>  
And Yellow is dead last!
<br/>  
What a disappointment after Yellow's
strong showing at Saratoga last spring.
<br/>  
Wait! Look out! Wait a second!
<br/>  
Out of nowhere,
Orange breaks ahead of the pack,
<br/>  
and now, in the backstretch,
Orange and Green.
<br/>  
Orange and Green,
and Orange takes it by a nose!
<br/>  
Green places and Red shows.
<br/>  
Please come to the window
to collect your winnings!
<br/>  
-What window? There's a window?
-No. No, there's not. Here you go.
<br/>  
Congratulations, sir.
<br/>  
I'm new.
<br/>  
Our original initiative rapidly got
all tangled up in the sale of arms.
<br/>  
And the sale of arms got tangled up...
<br/>  
Hey, why don't you call
one of your old friends?
<br/>  
I heard Danny's back in town. Or Pat?
<br/>  
And tell them I work as a carny?
No, thank you.
<br/>  
-Yo! Guy!
-Yeah?
<br/>  
-Give me five.
-Okay.
<br/>  
Hey, I heard some big fat lady
fell off the Paratrooper.
<br/>  
Oh, really? I didn't hear about that.
Was she okay?
<br/>  
I don't know.
Hey, you know what? Give me 10.
<br/>  
-Okay.
-You know what? Make it 15.
<br/>  
Yeah, I heard she was this
big, fat, slob of a woman, you know?
<br/>  
Hey, he won! Check it out!
Way to go, Dom! Way to go, Dom!
<br/>  
-We got a winner!
-Come on, check it out!
<br/>  
Okay, sir, actually,
I saw you holding him over the bottles.
<br/>  
That's cheating.
<br/>  
Oh, no. He won fair-and-square, sir.
You know, you gotta give him a prize!
<br/>  
-Yeah, I saw him throw it!
-Hey, thank you, sir.
<br/>  
-Guys, hey, fellas, I could lose my job.
-This faggot's trying to rip off a kid!
<br/>  
Why don't you give the kid
a fucking panda.
<br/>  
Here you go, here's your panda.
<br/>  
Yeah, thanks. Here you go, Dom.
I mean, he's just a little kid.
<br/>  
Look, am I gonna get in trouble?
<br/>  
No one's ever supposed
to lose a giant-ass panda.
<br/>  
Is it worth getting knifed over?
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
-Hi. I'm James Brennan. I just started.
-Em. Nice to meet you.
<br/>  
Sucks you're gonna lose your job
your second day, James.
<br/>  
No. Shit. I need this job.
<br/>  
I'm kidding. You're okay.
<br/>  
I'll tell Bobby you lost the panda
at knifepoint.
<br/>  
Yo, Connell! Rock on!
<br/>  
-Who's that?
-Connell. He's the maintenance guy.
<br/>  
Hey, Joel, is that a pipe?
<br/>  
Yeah, I know.
<br/>  
It's a revolting affectation,
but it relaxes me.
<br/>  
-Hey, Joel. Hey.
-Hi.
<br/>  
You guys want some of this?
<br/>  
-I bagged it from Paulette. Cuban rum?
-Thanks.
<br/>  
I think somebody was trying
to write "Satan Lives" on that wall,
<br/>  
but they spelled it "Satin Lives."
<br/>  
One of those textile-worshipping cults,
no doubt.
<br/>  
-That's quite funny.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Lou Reed? I like the tee, Em.
<br/>  
You know
about Connell and Lou, right?
<br/>  
No, I don't know about them.
<br/>  
Time out, guys.
<br/>  
-Guys, he doesn't know the legend.
-Oh, my God!
<br/>  
-Tell him.
-Connell once jammed with Lou Reed.
<br/>  
-Really?
-The historic Lou Reed.
<br/>  
-The Lou Reed.
-So Connell's like a real musician?
<br/>  
Yeah, he's got his own band.
It's frigging awesome.
<br/>  
-He's gotta get a lot of pussy with it.
-He's married, you perv!
<br/>  
Nice pipe, Grandpa!
<br/>  
Oh, my God.
That was a whole corn dog!
<br/>  
I'm sorry, Joel.
My brother is such a douche.
<br/>  
Looks like it's us!
Let's go, panty stain!
<br/>  
"Panty stain," that's me.
Good night, everybody.
<br/>  
Hey, I could give you a ride,
if you want.
<br/>  
Really? Frigo, I got a ride. Really?
<br/>  
-What?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-Thank you so much. I got a ride.
-Hey, what?
<br/>  
You can go. Good night.
<br/>  
-You got a ride?
-Yes.
<br/>  
All right, then.
Then why don't you ride this?
<br/>  
-Oh, my God.
-Frigo.
<br/>  
-All right, I'll see you, Brennan.
-What the hell was that?
<br/>  
It's just my life.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-Here, have some rum.
-Thanks.
<br/>  
Oh, shit.
Sorry, my mother. She's very nosy.
<br/>  
Yeah, she used to read my journals.
I had to start writing them in Italian.
<br/>  
I took Italian for a year.
I went through an opera...
<br/>  
Okay, she's gone.
<br/>  
So, Joel told me that you're gonna go
to Columbia for grad school.
<br/>  
-Yeah.
-Wow. I'm at NYU right now.
<br/>  
Oh, really? Oh, that's cool.
<br/>  
Maybe I'll run into you
on the streets of NYC.
<br/>  
-What are you studying?
-Journalism.
<br/>  
Yeah, I want to be, like,
a travel essayist.
<br/>  
But I want to report
on the real state of the world.
<br/>  
You know, like Charles Dickens,
<br/>  
for example, wrote
what you might call travel books,
<br/>  
but he visited prisons
and mental asylums.
<br/>  
-That's cool.
-Yeah, is it?
<br/>  
-Yeah.
-Okay.
<br/>  
No, it is, it's...
<br/>  
But why do you have to
go to grad school for that?
<br/>  
No, that's a valid question,
<br/>  
but, actually, journalism is kind of
like this old boys' network still.
<br/>  
You need the right connections.
It's very Ivy League, very exclusive.
<br/>  
Stupid. I think my mother would rather
I intern at some Fortune 500 company
<br/>  
or something like that.
<br/>  
-Fuck that, right?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
I got to go. I have to meet a friend.
<br/>  
-Okay. Yeah, thanks for the ride.
-Sure.
<br/>  
Hey, I heard you jammed
with Lou Reed.
<br/>  
-Don't believe everything you hear.
-Okay.
<br/>  
I'll tell you about it sometime.
<br/>  
So, where does your band play?
<br/>  
Usual shitholes around town.
I need better musicians.
<br/>  
-I'm starting a new band out in LA.
-Los Angeles?
<br/>  
Yeah. It's going to be cool.
Going this winter.
<br/>  
-Jesus.
-Nasty.
<br/>  
You'll get better at avoiding that.
<br/>  
Hey, guys. Party at my house tonight.
My dad's out of town.
<br/>  
I'm invited?
<br/>  
Yep, that's why I'm telling you.
<br/>  
-Connell?
-You kiddies have fun.
<br/>  
She's cool, right?
<br/>  
You're just smearing that around.
<br/>  
Hey, Sue, I'm a virgin at table games,
so go easy on me.
<br/>  
We're having a ping-pong tournament!
<br/>  
-Hey.
-Hey.
<br/>  
Nice digs.
<br/>  
Kind of begs the question of why the
hell you're working at Adventureland?
<br/>  
Well, you know, my dad's a lawyer.
<br/>  
It's been his life-long dream for
his daughter to work at Adventureland.
<br/>  
-High hopes.
-Also gets me out of the house.
<br/>  
So we can drink your parents' booze.
It's okay?
<br/>  
-Absolutely.
-Yes!
<br/>  
-Awesome.
-Don't touch me.
<br/>  
Hey, I actually brought something
for the party.
<br/>  
-What is that?
-It's a joint.
<br/>  
-Oh.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Bobby is weird.
<br/>  
I had to go back and get the extra
employee key for the bathroom,
<br/>  
and I went back, I opened the door,
<br/>  
and there were all these pictures
of him and Paulette, naked.
<br/>  
What a weirdo.
<br/>  
Hey, I'm gonna go for a swim.
Anybody care to join me?
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
Come on.
<br/>  
Is anybody else coming in here,
or is it just us?
<br/>  
Yeah, okay.
<br/>  
-See, it's not so bad. It's okay.
-No, it's okay.
<br/>  
-Do you have any more of that pot?
-Yeah, at home. Why?
<br/>  
-We should make pot cookies.
-Okay.
<br/>  
That would be so fun.
Have you done that?
<br/>  
-I have not. I've had cookies.
-All right.
<br/>  
My connections have all dried up.
That's why I'm asking.
<br/>  
Your connections have dried up?
<br/>  
What, you think, I have ties
to the underworld or something?
<br/>  
I have 5 joints.
<br/>  
You think I can, like,
put a hit out on somebody?
<br/>  
-Yeah.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Oh, my God!
<br/>  
I got you. I got the door.
It's only 3 feet, so I can handle it.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
-I'm gonna get a drink.
-Okay.
<br/>  
You want one?
<br/>  
-Coming?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Yeah, I'll meet you inside.
<br/>  
-Okay.
-I'll meet you inside.
<br/>  
-Okay.
-Okay.
<br/>  
Shit.
<br/>  
Boner! You got a boner!
Brennan's got a boner!
<br/>  
Yeah!
<br/>  
Thanks.
<br/>  
I like your records.
Eno, Replacements, Big Star.
<br/>  
Hey, give me your underwear.
I'll throw them in the dryer for you.
<br/>  
-I promise you'll get them back.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Thank you.
<br/>  
-Who's that?
-It's my stepmom.
<br/>  
I don't think there's any pictures
of my mom in here.
<br/>  
-She died 2 years ago.
-Really? I'm sorry.
<br/>  
My dad remarried last year.
That's Francy.
<br/>  
You see that unholy abomination
on her head?
<br/>  
-Yeah.
-It's a wig.
<br/>  
Is it?
<br/>  
She had, like, a nervous breakdown
when her first husband divorced her.
<br/>  
Lost all her hair.
<br/>  
I would feel bad if she wasn't
such a status-obsessed witch.
<br/>  
-I'm buzzed. You?
-Yeah, kind of.
<br/>  
-What was that?
-What was what?
<br/>  
I'm gonna go...
You want to go see what they're doing?
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
I think I drank, like,
a whole bottle of vodka.
<br/>  
You were drinking vermouth
the whole night, it's disgusting.
<br/>  
Yeah, it's a type of vodka.
<br/>  
You okay? Frigo? What are you doing?
<br/>  
Okay, good night!
<br/>  
Hello?
<br/>  
Hey. No, actually,
the party broke up pretty early.
<br/>  
I'm in here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-So we have, like, 5 minutes?
-No.
<br/>
<br/>  
There's not much point
in wasting time, though.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
Lisa P. is back!
<br/>  
-Lisa P. is back!
-Lisa P.? Did you hear that?
<br/>  
Lisa P. is back! Lisa P. is back!
<br/>  
-Brennan, Brennan, Lisa P. is back!
-Yeah? Who's Lisa P.?
<br/>  
Holy mother of crap!
"Who's Lisa P.?"
<br/>  
That's Lisa P.
<br/>  
Come on, come on
<br/>  
Have you ever heard
those opening lines
<br/>  
You should leave this small town
way behind
<br/>  
I'll be your partner
Show you the steps
<br/>  
Oh, my God,
look at the shape of her ass.
<br/>  
It's a platonic ideal.
That ass is a higher truth.
<br/>  
Look, look at that little portal of light,
just below her crotch,
<br/>  
right where the thigh
meets the pudendum.
<br/>  
The pudendum? Are you pre-med?
<br/>  
I'm telling you, man, I've had dreams
about that diamond-shape portal.
<br/>  
She's coming over here, man. Be cool.
<br/>  
Okay, I'll try to hold it together.
<br/>  
-Hey, Lisa. Hey, Kelly.
-Hey, Joel.
<br/>  
So, I didn't expect you to be back here.
<br/>  
Oh, man, I had my whole summer, like,
mapped out.
<br/>  
Laying out by the pool by day,
dancing by night.
<br/>  
But my dad got injured on the job,
and he's laid up, so I got to help out.
<br/>  
Sorry to hear that.
My mom has shingles.
<br/>  
Oh.
<br/>  
Well, I gotta go run the Musik-Express.
<br/>  
I don't want Paulette bitching me out
on my first day.
<br/>  
-I'm Lisa.
-James.
<br/>  
I heard you lost a giant-ass
panda at knifepoint.
<br/>  
Did you?
I guess my legend precedes me.
<br/>  
-What?
-It was nice to meet you.
<br/>  
Nice to meet you, too, James.
<br/>  
Bye, Lisa. Bye, Kelly.
<br/>  
A little more than 40%
of these fish are dead.
<br/>  
I am amazed
at how tiny my paycheck is,
<br/>  
after working doubles.
<br/>  
Well, we are doing the work of pathetic,
lazy morons.
<br/>  
Jesus fucking Christ, they play
this song, like, 20 times a day.
<br/>  
Fucking sadists. Fucking sadists!
<br/>  
Hey.
<br/>  
-Hey.
-Hey, I made you a tape.
<br/>  
These are my favorite bummer songs.
<br/>  
They're truly miserable,
pit-of-despair type songs.
<br/>  
-I think you'll love it.
-Cool.
<br/>  
Yeah. Hey, you want to get a drink
or something?
<br/>  
Sure.
<br/>  
I got a fever of 103
<br/>  
Come on, baby
Do you do more than dance?
<br/>  
I'm hot blooded, I'm hot blooded
<br/>  
-Hey, I feel like I should tell you.
-Tell me what?
<br/>  
Yeah. I had my heart broken recently.
<br/>  
Is that... I don't know,
I just thought I should tell you.
<br/>  
-That sucks.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-Who broke your heart?
-A girl at school.
<br/>  
Yeah, it's typical.
I actually... I think there was...
<br/>  
I think there was something there.
<br/>  
I think that we actually had,
like, potential.
<br/>  
I don't know. I think she was afraid.
<br/>  
Afraid of what?
<br/>  
I don't know.
Afraid of it being good or something.
<br/>  
Was the sex good?
<br/>  
She was very sexy.
<br/>  
You've been with a lot of girls?
<br/>  
Yep. Are we talking about, like,
intercourse specifically?
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
No, in that case,
<br/>  
there were actually a few times that I...
<br/>  
Yeah, a few times I could've done that.
<br/>  
But it wasn't... It wasn't exactly right.
<br/>  
Wait, so you're telling me
you're a virgin?
<br/>  
-There were circumstances...
-Oh, my God!
<br/>  
-Oh, my God.
-No, I went...
<br/>  
Okay, all right, for example, junior year,
I was dating this girl, Betsy Cooke.
<br/>  
Betsy was kind of, like...
She was kind of a prude, actually.
<br/>  
Anyway, one day,
I was reading Shakespeare,
<br/>  
and I realized I don't really love
this person. You know?
<br/>  
It was one of the sonnets.
<br/>  
"Being your slave, what should I do
<br/>  
"but tend upon the hours
and times of your desires?"
<br/>  
And I realized I don't want to tend
to Betsy's hours or her times.
<br/>  
All right, that doesn't matter.
<br/>  
Anyway, I drove to Betsy's house,
and I was literally about to tell her,
<br/>  
and that's the night
she said she wanted to have sex.
<br/>  
Can you believe it? It was the same...
You know, it was the same night, so...
<br/>  
And you didn't just fuck her anyway?
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
So what about you and intercourse?
<br/>  
-Can you stop saying "intercourse"?
-Sure, sure.
<br/>  
I don't know.
There were guys in high school,
<br/>  
and then, like, there were other ones.
<br/>  
-Were you in love with any of them?
-No. Hell no.
<br/>  
Got you.
<br/>  
Oh, hey, it's Connell. Hey, Connell!
<br/>  
-Jimbo.
-Hey, you know this place?
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Everybody knows this is my joint.
<br/>  
These guys work at the park.
This is Ronnie.
<br/>  
Nice to meet you.
<br/>  
-Hi.
-Hey.
<br/>  
We're gonna go meet some friends
in the back.
<br/>  
Cool.
<br/>  
Do it! My nephew!
<br/>  
Is that Connell's wife?
She's, like, really pretty.
<br/>  
Yeah, she is.
<br/>  
She works
at that lame disco, Razzmatazz.
<br/>  
-It's kind of sad.
-Oh, yeah? I've never been there.
<br/>  
No, I mean their marriage is sad.
He didn't want it. Now he's trapped.
<br/>  
Are you sure you want to go?
The band is really awful.
<br/>  
-Yeah, I just needed some air.
-Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-Hey, can we go somewhere?
-Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
Hey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-You made out with her?
-Yeah. Yeah, I just kissed her.
<br/>  
I don't know what came over me.
It was incredible.
<br/>  
Cool, man. How was that?
<br/>  
Fantastic. Joel, she's like...
She's, like, perfect, you know?
<br/>  
-Good for you, man.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
I got to open my booth.
<br/>  
Hey, do you have an ice-pick
I can jam into my ears?
<br/>  
I can't listen to this song again.
<br/>  
I don't, but I have this.
<br/>  
-Be cool with that.
-Okay. Thanks.
<br/>  
-Were you on a date last night?
-I wouldn't call it a date.
<br/>  
Not into Em?
<br/>  
No, she's great. She's great. I just...
<br/>  
I don't know
if I'm ready for a girlfriend yet.
<br/>  
I'm kind of getting over a broken heart.
<br/>  
-I hope you didn't tell her that.
-Why?
<br/>  
You told her that, didn't you?
<br/>  
James, no girl wants to hear about
some other chick you're hard up for.
<br/>  
-Right. They don't?
-They don't.
<br/>  
Look, I'm not saying
never be vulnerable with a girl.
<br/>  
I'm just saying don't play that card first.
<br/>  
Wait, it's a card? Like a card?
<br/>  
There's a science to it.
You're probably pretty good at science.
<br/>  
-That works now.
-Yeah. Okay.
<br/>  
Okay, observe. 2 options.
<br/>  
I can play it safe,
pick them off from back here,
<br/>  
or I can rush into the breach,
guns a-blazing.
<br/>  
Make a run right at the cortex,
and bombs away.
<br/>  
Fortune favors the bold. Virgil said that.
<br/>  
I'm sure Virgil had Bionic Mutant
in mind. I'm gonna go punch out.
<br/>  
-All right, bye.
-Your turn, man.
<br/>  
Okay, but I'm probably not gonna
be very good at this.
<br/>  
Hey.
<br/>  
I really want to see you tonight.
<br/>  
-Tonight?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Unless you got something else
going on.
<br/>  
You're doing really good.
<br/>  
I jump when he jumps
just instinctively.
<br/>  
Where? Where do you wanna go?
Not the backseat of your car.
<br/>  
We can go to my mom's.
<br/>  
-Hey, James?
-Yeah?
<br/>  
Whoa, bonus round. Kudos.
<br/>  
I heard you might have some weed.
<br/>  
Yeah, I have a stash.
Why, you like the ganja?
<br/>  
Sometimes.
<br/>  
Beer?
<br/>  
-Got anything stronger?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
So what excuse
do you give your mother
<br/>  
for coming down here so late?
<br/>  
Gotta pump some midnight iron?
<br/>  
Sometimes I come here to practice.
Give Ronnie a break.
<br/>  
You still hot for your wife?
What's the sex like?
<br/>  
Why? Why would you...
Why would you say that?
<br/>  
-Don't be mean.
-Jeez, you're sensitive.
<br/>  
No, I'm serious. When we're together,
we're good to each other.
<br/>  
Let's not ruin it.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
So, how's your dad?
<br/>  
Since he can't work,
he's been so fucked up.
<br/>  
Yeah. Stays in bed a lot.
Won't see anyone.
<br/>  
-Men are prideful creatures.
-Exactly.
<br/>  
Do you believe in God?
<br/>  
Wow, theology doesn't come up
a lot around here.
<br/>  
Yeah, but you see someone you love
in pain,
<br/>  
you sort of think
about that kind of stuff.
<br/>  
I believe in love.
<br/>  
I mean,
I think that love is very transferable,
<br/>  
I mean, transformable.
<br/>  
I think that love
makes things transform together.
<br/>  
I'm majorly high.
<br/>  
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Yeah, me, too.
<br/>  
I'm having dinner with my parents.
<br/>  
Somebody's hungry.
<br/>  
James, I read
that Pitt has some journalism courses.
<br/>  
-Is that so?
-Oh, yeah?
<br/>  
Yeah, I was just thinking that,
<br/>  
you know, it might make
fiscal sense for you
<br/>  
to stay close to home for a while.
<br/>  
And they have these broadcasting
internships on Mister Rogers'.
<br/>  
I get to intern on a kids' show
with marionettes.
<br/>  
Mom, I thought you wanted me to go
to an Ivy League school,
<br/>  
like the one I've been accepted to.
<br/>  
I am... I am just trying to be pragmatic.
<br/>  
They're hand puppets,
not marionettes, on Mister Rogers'.
<br/>  
You know, like,
"Royal greetings, I am King Friday."
<br/>  
That's a terrible impression.
<br/>  
James, what is wrong with you?
<br/>  
We, the people, in order to have
a more perfect union, say, "Let's party!"
<br/>  
Hey! Jugglers, fireworks!
<br/>  
Mr. Fabulous' Incredible
Performing Canines tonight!
<br/>  
Hey, kid. In the clown mouth.
Come on.
<br/>  
-Be a pal. Thanks, buddy.
-Eat it!
<br/>  
Son of a bitch!
<br/>  
Get him! Get him!
<br/>  
-Come here.
-Be careful.
<br/>  
All right! Hey!
<br/>  
Oh, my God!
<br/>  
I don't even celebrate July 4th,
you know? I celebrate Bastille Day.
<br/>  
That's why Bastille Day
is gonna be a blast for me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-Park's closed, Em.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-Rich, you scared the hell out of us.
-Rich, it's me, James.
<br/>  
-Park's closed, James.
-Okay, we'll leave soon, okay?
<br/>  
Better leave now. The park's closed.
<br/>  
-All right, we better leave now.
-Okay. Here we go.
<br/>  
Okay. Thanks, Rich.
<br/>  
Don't dream it's over
<br/>  
Hey now, hey now
<br/>  
When the world comes in
<br/>  
They come, they come
<br/>  
I think you're so beautiful.
<br/>  
Oh, fuck.
<br/>  
-Hey, kids!
-Hey, hey. Hey, what's going on?
<br/>  
-It's my friend James, Dad.
-Hi. Nice to meet you, sir.
<br/>  
-Nice to meet you, James.
-You, too.
<br/>  
-Hi, James. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.
<br/>  
Well, I'm gonna go do some work
before bed.
<br/>  
-Good night.
-Good night.
<br/>  
-Good night.
-Good night, party pooper.
<br/>  
So, it was a lovely party
at the Melnicks'.
<br/>  
And, you know,
their daughter Lori is lovely.
<br/>  
Now, she said you two
used to be best friends.
<br/>  
She used to sleep over in,
like, junior high.
<br/>  
Did you know that she is at law school
at Northwestern?
<br/>  
Lori Melnick,
<br/>  
she once violated our cat Gypsy
with a ballpoint pen.
<br/>  
All right, Emily!
That's enough, young lady.
<br/>  
See you later.
<br/>  
Sy.
<br/>  
I can't believe
my dad wants to be with that.
<br/>  
Do you want to hear
something fucked up?
<br/>  
What?
<br/>  
When my mom first started getting,
like, really sick,
<br/>  
my dad starts going to temple.
<br/>  
He's never been serious about his faith.
<br/>  
But he decided to buddy up to God,
<br/>  
like he thought
it was going to help save my mom.
<br/>  
And that's where he met Francy.
<br/>  
My mom loses her hair in chemo,
<br/>  
and my dad starts fucking
a bald woman.
<br/>  
It's just weird.
<br/>  
I'll take you home.
<br/>  
We started dancing
and love put us into a groove
<br/>  
As soon as we started to move
<br/>  
The music played while our bodies
displayed for the dance
<br/>  
It's nice when Paulette's got the day off.
<br/>  
Put that disco station on.
<br/>  
Hey, you know,
I'm a one-man woman, so...
<br/>  
-Hey, Bobby. I'm on break.
-All right, let's see how you did.
<br/>  
Hey, babe. How's it... Hello?
<br/>  
Yeah, he's right here.
<br/>  
It's your mother.
<br/>  
Sorry.
<br/>  
Hi, Ma. No, Ma, that's the pilot light.
<br/>  
It's supposed to be on.
<br/>  
No, the place is not going to blow. Ma?
<br/>  
I'll be right there.
<br/>  
I gotta go.
<br/>  
-Jimbo, can I ask you something?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
You got one of those
little baby joints on you?
<br/>  
-I do.
-Let's go.
<br/>  
-Is your mom okay?
-Yeah, she's a little dramatic, my mom.
<br/>  
Kind of nutty since my dad skipped out.
<br/>  
Where'd he go?
<br/>  
I don't know. He left a long time ago.
<br/>  
-This is cool.
-Yeah, Lou Reed.
<br/>  
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Satellite Of Love.
<br/>  
Of course. Right on.
<br/>  
You gotta tell me your Lou Reed story.
He's like a real hero to me.
<br/>  
-Hey, man, how's it going with Em?
-I don't know. It's going...
<br/>  
She's...
<br/>  
I think I'm in love with her.
<br/>  
Soon it will be filled
<br/>  
With parking cars
<br/>  
I watch it for a little while
<br/>  
I love to watch things on TV
<br/>  
This will just take a second,
Jimbo. Don't finish that joint.
<br/>  
Satellite of love
<br/>  
Satellite of love
<br/>  
Satellite of love
<br/>  
Hey.
<br/>  
I was hanging out
with your boyfriend earlier.
<br/>  
-He's in love with you.
-What?
<br/>  
He said, I quote,
"I think I'm in love with her."
<br/>  
Right.
<br/>  
Hey, are you going
to Razzmatazz tonight?
<br/>  
It's 2-for-Tuesday.
You get 2 for the price of one.
<br/>  
I want action tonight
<br/>  
Satisfaction all night
<br/>  
I grab my hat and I grab my shoes
<br/>  
Tonight I'm gonna
hit the streets and cruise
<br/>  
You have to do something!
<br/>  
You're not doing anything!
<br/>  
I can't take it anymore!
<br/>  
Maybe she needs to see
Dr. Schacter again.
<br/>  
You have to do something, okay?
<br/>  
Something has to change.
<br/>  
You know she works at that park,
that trashy park, just to embarrass us!
<br/>  
You're coming through
<br/>  
Seems just like a dream
<br/>  
It's a mystery to me
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
What are you majoring in?
<br/>  
Russian Literature
and Slavic Languages.
<br/>  
-Oh, wow, that's really interesting.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
What career track is that?
<br/>  
Cabbie, hot-dog vendor,
marijuana delivery guy.
<br/>  
The world is my oyster.
<br/>  
You kids need another round?
<br/>  
-Thanks, Ronnie, we're fine.
-Actually, we'll take 2 more.
<br/>  
I'll have 2. Joel, you can have 1.
<br/>  
-What the hell? Are you gonna stop?
-2-for-Tuesday.
<br/>  
Em, I love this song!
Come on, let's dance! Let's dance.
<br/>  
Come on. Come on.
<br/>  
-Come on.
-Okay.
<br/>
<br/>  
Here, ready? Stay with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-You like that?
-Yes.
<br/>  
Marcy Feingold, ninth grade,
taught me that one.
<br/>  
-Good one!
-Thanks a lot.
<br/>  
-Nice moves, Brennan.
-Thanks.
<br/>  
-Razzmatazz!
-Come on, Razzmatazz, we're hungry.
<br/>  
-But we love you more!
-It knows.
<br/>  
More.
<br/>  
Oh, my God. You okay?
<br/>  
-Razzmatazz.
-Come on.
<br/>  
All right.
<br/>  
-There you go.
-You're so strong-ish.
<br/>  
I'll take that.
<br/>  
I'm so surprised
I'm making out with you.
<br/>  
Me, too.
<br/>  
Em, I think you're incredible.
<br/>  
Hey, there's a lot of shit in my life.
<br/>  
I'm not ready for this.
I need to take things slow.
<br/>  
Okay, all right.
<br/>  
I'm sorry.
<br/>  
Hey. Let me help you with that.
<br/>  
I got it.
<br/>  
That is ugly.
<br/>  
Thanks.
<br/>  
-Hey, so how's your dad?
-He's hanging in there.
<br/>  
-Yeah? Still... Still not working?
-No, no.
<br/>  
The Musik-Express!
<br/>  
-These rides are safe, right?
-Supposedly.
<br/>  
I wouldn't mess around on any of them.
<br/>  
Last summer, there was this drunk idiot
goofing around on the Comet Booster,
<br/>  
trying to kick his buddy.
<br/>  
They found his Reebok
in the parking lot, with his foot in it.
<br/>  
-Yo, Lisa. We're partners today.
-Great.
<br/>  
So it's official.
<br/>  
My friend Boomer
hooked me up with a job
<br/>  
at the Mercedes dealership
on Route 30.
<br/>  
Yeah, I'm getting a car right away.
Payments deducted from my check.
<br/>  
Yeah, I'm gonna go for a 560,
convertible, in gold, leather interior.
<br/>  
I'm even gonna get
a compact disc player.
<br/>  
-It's gonna be insane.
-To the max.
<br/>  
So, hey, Lis, you wanna
go see Judas Priest at Civic Arena?
<br/>  
-My friend Fitzy got me floor seats, so...
-That's okay. Take Boomer.
<br/>  
And go get the hose.
There's dried puke down there.
<br/>  
You don't like Priest?
<br/>  
-I'm busy that night.
-I didn't tell you what night.
<br/>  
James, you and I should go out
some night.
<br/>  
I get it, that's a funny one.
<br/>  
Face! Douche.
<br/>  
-Just let me know when.
-Yeah?
<br/>  
Pete, dried puke.
<br/>  
I'm serious. I wouldn't mind going out
with a nice guy for a change.
<br/>  
Cool. Yeah. That would be very cool.
<br/>  
Oh, come on, man!
<br/>  
-Want to push a button?
-No, I'm on games only.
<br/>  
Okay, yeah, which one? Okay.
<br/>  
-Oh, my gosh!
-Shit! Shit! Shit!
<br/>  
Wow! You fucked this up perfectly!
<br/>  
-I know. I work on games, so...
-I'm impressed.
<br/>  
I know.
I shouldn't have even been here.
<br/>  
-Shit.
-Hey.
<br/>  
Connell, I need to ask you something.
<br/>  
Hand me the crescent wrench,
would you?
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
So, Lisa P. just asked me if I wanted
to go out with her sometime.
<br/>  
-Lisa P.?
-Yeah. It's insane.
<br/>  
I think she might've just been trying
to piss off Pete O'Malley but...
<br/>  
Can you imagine any universe where
she would get with a guy like me?
<br/>  
She asked you out?
<br/>  
You're a fucking idiot if you don't go.
It's Lisa P.
<br/>  
-Hold this, would you?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
That girl's a virgin.
Can you believe that?
<br/>  
Oh. In this day and age. You'd think...
<br/>  
Well, she's a Catholic girl.
They usually won't let you screw them.
<br/>  
-But what they will let you do...
-Yeah, but what about Em?
<br/>  
Are you getting all your needs
met by her?
<br/>  
We're taking it slow.
<br/>  
Right. Right. Okay, here's the thing.
<br/>  
Every time you meet a beautiful woman,
<br/>  
don't you imagine what she'd look like
underneath you, naked?
<br/>  
-What? No. No.
-Someone like Lisa P.
<br/>  
I mean, Jesus Christ, it's like
every cell in your body's on fire, right?
<br/>  
That's a little hyperbolic, but, yeah,
I know, I see where you're going.
<br/>  
That's the way we're wired.
It's the way we're wired.
<br/>  
It sucks, but it's just a fact of nature.
It's also tragic.
<br/>  
My feelings for Em are vast.
<br/>  
James, imagine it. Lisa P.
<br/>  
I know. Lisa P. I know.
<br/>  
-Hey.
-Hey.
<br/>  
I brought you this.
<br/>  
It's one of my favorite authors.
Gogol. Russian.
<br/>  
He lost his mind,
burned the only copy of his final book,
<br/>  
died a week later of self-starvation.
<br/>  
Well...
<br/>  
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Hey, do you maybe want to go see
a shitty movie or something sometime?
<br/>  
Yeah, I just... You know,
I did something kind of stupid.
<br/>  
I... I told my brother that
we made out.
<br/>  
-That's bad?
-No, no, no.
<br/>  
But he... He told my parents.
<br/>  
We're Catholic.
<br/>  
Pete told my parents that you're Jewish.
<br/>  
But I'm an atheist.
<br/>  
I mean, more of a pragmatic nihilist,
I guess,
<br/>  
-or an existential pagan, if you will...
-Yeah, yeah.
<br/>  
But my parents are really strict.
<br/>  
I'm sorry.
<br/>  
-It's still a good book.
-Nah, I'm sorry.
<br/>  
-Hey, Joel.
-Hey.
<br/>  
How'd it go with Sue?
<br/>  
Not so good.
<br/>  
Hey, Em, come on. Don't say anything!
<br/>  
Come on, worse things have happened
to the Jews.
<br/>  
Fuck that!
<br/>  
You know,
you don't deserve to date Joel!
<br/>  
I mean, you're an anti-Semitic asshole!
<br/>  
What do you, like,
hate gay people, too?
<br/>  
Do you support apartheid?
You are not my friend.
<br/>  
Bam! Child's play.
<br/>  
Look, you can't tell anybody,
but I'm going out with Lisa P. tonight.
<br/>  
-You're what?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
This morning she asked me
if I wanted to hang out sometime.
<br/>  
What happened?
I thought you were crazy about Em.
<br/>  
I am. I am.
<br/>  
But, you know,
I don't know if she necessarily,
<br/>  
like, wants something, you know,
kind of serious.
<br/>  
And, Joel, we're men. You know,
we're, like, wired to meet our needs.
<br/>  
I get it, it's a biological imperative.
<br/>  
Frigo, you can't tell anybody,
but I have a date tonight with Lisa P.
<br/>  
What? You know,
I should give you a double-sack-whack
<br/>  
-for telling a lie like that.
-Okay, don't believe me.
<br/>  
-Where are you going?
-The Velvet Touch.
<br/>  
Thanks.
<br/>  
How's the wine?
<br/>  
-It's good!
-Yeah.
<br/>  
I just need to tell you something.
<br/>  
Yeah, is it cool if we don't tell
a lot of people about tonight?
<br/>  
'Cause I think there's someone
at the park
<br/>  
who may have a little thing for me,
and I don't want her to feel bad.
<br/>  
-You mean Em?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
So you like working at the park?
<br/>  
Yeah, I think it could be
character building.
<br/>  
And, you know,
I've made a lot of friends.
<br/>  
Yeah, you and Connell
seem pretty tight.
<br/>  
Yeah, I like him. I think he's interesting.
<br/>  
I think he's kind of
like a, you know, poetic soul.
<br/>  
-That guy's got some problems.
-What do you mean?
<br/>  
Last summer, he was having this thing
with this girl from the snack bar.
<br/>  
He used to take her to his mother's
basement to have sex with her.
<br/>  
His mother's basement.
How gross is that?
<br/>  
But he's married, right?
<br/>  
-Didn't stop him from hitting on me.
-Wow.
<br/>  
-Is that Frigo?
-Yeah, it is Frigo.
<br/>  
I wonder what he's doing here.
I should say hi. I've known him since...
<br/>  
Excuse me.
<br/>  
-You son of a bitch, that's Lisa P.!.
-What the fuck are you doing here?
<br/>  
I'm sorry. Look, I'm sorry, I thought
you were full of shit, but holy shit!
<br/>  
There she is! Think you can get me
naked pictures of her?
<br/>  
Frigo, get the fuck out of here,
<br/>  
and you can't tell anybody
about this, okay?
<br/>  
All right, all right, relax, Brennan.
<br/>  
-What's it worth to you?
-You're shaking me down?
<br/>  
No... Yeah, yeah.
<br/>  
I hate you with such great fervor. I...
<br/>  
Thanks, Brennan.
<br/>  
Sorry about that. What a coincidence.
<br/>  
Frigo was out to rent a video,
saw us through the window, and...
<br/>  
-Wow.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
And here we are.
I wonder how the fondue is tonight.
<br/>  
I want to visit every continent,
every country, really.
<br/>  
Charles Dickens actually wrote
these really interesting travel pieces,
<br/>  
but he visited prisons...
<br/>  
Would you rather have a sailboat
or a speedboat?
<br/>  
-Gee, I guess...
-I think sailboats are, like,
<br/>  
way more cooler, you know,
like more classic.
<br/>  
Though I bet speedboats would be
a lot more fun.
<br/>  
What were you saying?
<br/>  
Just babbling.
<br/>  
Oh.
<br/>  
I just need to get normal
before I go inside.
<br/>  
Put on some perfume
to cover the smell.
<br/>  
I was going to suggest more perfume.
<br/>  
-Shoot, my brush.
-Yeah. Hold on.
<br/>  
-Jesus, what the hell is this?
-Is that yours?
<br/>  
-No. I guess it's my dad's.
-Here, pull over here.
<br/>  
Can you smell the pot?
<br/>  
You smell amazing.
<br/>  
Thanks for tonight. It was fun.
<br/>  
Yeah. Yeah, it was.
<br/>  
Fondue.
<br/>  
-Oh, God.
-Tiger.
<br/>  
Sorry.
<br/>  
-Another time.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-Good night.
-Good night.
<br/>  
-Hey.
-Hey.
<br/>  
Hey. I missed your call last night.
Sorry about that.
<br/>  
I was out
with some old high-school buddies.
<br/>  
-Sounds fun.
-Yeah, it was.
<br/>  
We got caught up reminiscing.
I was out pretty late.
<br/>  
But what were you calling about?
<br/>  
Calling to say sorry. I felt like I was
kind of a jerk the other night.
<br/>  
Okay. Sorry. Yeah, me, too.
I was drunk.
<br/>  
And I brought you something.
<br/>  
-This bag?
-Mmm-hmm. What's inside the bag?
<br/>  
-Is that a couple of joints?
-I think so. For pot cookies.
<br/>  
-Oh, my. You follow through.
-I do.
<br/>  
Cool. This'll be fun.
<br/>  
-Let's do it.
-Okay. I'm only having half, okay?
<br/>  
Walnuts? You want to see me go
into anaphylactic shock? Fuck.
<br/>  
-Home-made? Yummy.
-Brennan, you gonna eat the other half?
<br/>  
Sorry.
<br/>  
Spinning on that dizzy edge
<br/>  
I kissed her face
and kissed her head
<br/>  
And dreamed of
all the different ways
<br/>  
I had to make her glow
<br/>  
"Why are you so far away?" she said
<br/>  
"Why won't you ever know
that I'm in love with you
<br/>  
"That I'm in love with you"
<br/>  
You
Soft and only
<br/>  
You
Lost and lonely
<br/>  
You
Strange as angels
<br/>  
Dancing in the deepest oceans
<br/>  
Twisting in the water
<br/>  
And what a race we have here today,
ladies and gentlemen. Boy!
<br/>  
And nobody is in the lead.
Nobody is in the lead.
<br/>  
In fact, what is so mind-blowing
about this particular race
<br/>  
is how evenly-matched
these particular competitors are.
<br/>  
And Yellow is dead last.
I don't think Yellow's moved once.
<br/>  
This is a fall from grace
for the once-great stallion, Yellow.
<br/>  
You know, Yellow has inseminated
over 1, 000 foals in his lifetime,
<br/>  
which might explain
his current exhaustion.
<br/>  
And you won, Number 9,
here you go... Here you go, great job.
<br/>  
Hey, Bobby.
<br/>  
Brennan, what are you doing?
<br/>  
-You been toking up?
-What?
<br/>  
-You been drinking drugs?
-No!
<br/>  
Your eyes are red.
Have you been crying?
<br/>  
Yeah, maybe, like, a little bit before.
But no, Bobby,
<br/>  
I'm feeling sick because I think I ate
a bad corn dog before, Bobby.
<br/>  
That's why.
<br/>  
You know, why don't you go over
to Hats Off T o Larry
<br/>  
-and collect some balls?
-Okay.
<br/>  
And I'll tell you what, I'll take over this.
<br/>  
Hey, you all right?
<br/>  
-Yeah, thank you.
-All right.
<br/>  
This is how we met.
<br/>  
And they're off! In the lead is Green 5.
Green is in the lead.
<br/>  
Green 5, Green 5 in the lead.
And there you are, Green 5!
<br/>  
Green! You really got it going on!
You know exactly what you're doing.
<br/>  
Green! You got it, Green! You won!
<br/>  
Pass that down to her.
Loser, pass that down. Thank you.
<br/>  
-Can I get some balls?
-You're gonna have to get more balls.
<br/>  
The customer's always right.
<br/>  
Here you go.
<br/>  
-I hit that thing dead-on!
-Yet he still retains his chapeau.
<br/>  
Whoa, whoa. Come on.
<br/>  
Hey!
<br/>  
What the fuck?
It's glued on, the fucking thing.
<br/>  
-It's not worth it.
-We have a winner.
<br/>  
-Nicky.
-Congratulations.
<br/>  
The fucking thing is glued on?
His hat is glued on?
<br/>  
-Fuck this, Nicky.
-What is so fucking funny?
<br/>  
-Yeah, what's so fucking funny?
-I don't know.
<br/>  
-Oh, my God!
-My God.
<br/>  
-What the fuck?
-Not so funny now, is it?
<br/>  
You can't do shit like that.
Like, what the fuck?
<br/>  
-You punch him in the face?
-Back off, slut!
<br/>  
-Don't fucking touch her, man.
-What are you gonna do, faggot?
<br/>  
Oh, fuck.
<br/>  
-You're fucking dead!
-You jerk!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
-The option of the flute?
-Option of the flute...
<br/>  
People are trying to kill me.
<br/>  
Get the fuck out, motherfucker!
<br/>  
Move.
<br/>  
Get out of my doorway, motherfucker!
Give me a reason!
<br/>  
Just give me a fucking reason!
You don't know what I'm capable of!
<br/>  
Come on! Please!
You don't know what I'm capable of!
<br/>  
-Bastard.
-Thanks, Bobby.
<br/>  
-No problem.
-Okay, I'm gonna take the back way.
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, good.
<br/>  
You know what, now that I think of it,
the flute is actually more expensive.
<br/>  
You guys should have seen
Brennan wail on that greaseball, man.
<br/>  
-I can't believe you hit someone.
-Me, either.
<br/>  
How'd you do it?
Did you hit him like this? Oh, psych!
<br/>  
Dude, this guy was huge.
I mean, Brennan went up, like, one hit...
<br/>  
-And just dropped the guy.
-I can't believe they call that a hit.
<br/>  
Then his buddy started
chasing him all around the park,
<br/>  
and then he hid in Bobby's office.
<br/>  
Yeah, see, that's more like
the son of a bitch.
<br/>  
Bobby kicked the door down
<br/>  
and came out all psycho
with this bat like...
<br/>  
And all his buddies just go, "Okay."
<br/>  
Where's the guy?
Was he ever...
<br/>  
I don't know.
They left him on the pavement.
<br/>  
Then I got his girlfriend's number.
<br/>  
Where are you taking me?
<br/>  
You've never been to this place before?
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
I think you might be the coolest
and cutest guy I ever met.
<br/>  
Really?
<br/>  
I mean, I'm really high, but...
<br/>  
I don't want to lose you.
<br/>  
-Forget to refrigerate these?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
When did they get in, yesterday?
<br/>  
-Around what time?
-In the morning.
<br/>  
-They smell weird?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
-I think that's normal, though.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Stuffy, fry these up!
<br/>  
Hey, Brennan, I want to talk to you.
Want to pick up some extra shifts?
<br/>  
-Yeah, sure.
-Good. Because Joel quit.
<br/>  
-What?
-He's passed on.
<br/>  
He moved on, honey.
He didn't pass on, he moved on.
<br/>  
I know, I heard you!
<br/>  
-What are you doing here?
-You didn't call me back.
<br/>  
Look, I can't abide the humiliation
of you seeing the inside of my house.
<br/>  
The vile plastic slipcovers,
the art-fair paintings.
<br/>  
And it's really messy.
Just go around back. I'll meet you.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>  
Hey, Jeffrey!
Turn off the fucking lawnmower.
<br/>  
-Fine.
-I'm trying to have a conversation here.
<br/>  
-Fuck off, fuck face.
-Nimrod.
<br/>  
I hate you, asshole.
<br/>  
-Hey, is it because of Sue?
-What?
<br/>  
Why you quit. Because, Joel,
you're a great guy, you know,
<br/>  
and she doesn't deserve you.
<br/>  
James, look at me.
I'm not a good-looking guy.
<br/>  
And I'm poor.
Girls aren't gonna go near me
<br/>  
when there's all these
fucking yuppies around.
<br/>  
That's ridiculous.
Not all women are like that.
<br/>  
You know, Em isn't like that.
<br/>  
-Em?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
You don't even appreciate
what you have.
<br/>  
You're chasing after Lisa P.
<br/>  
when you have this incredible,
beautiful girl right fucking there.
<br/>  
Fuck this.
<br/>  
Don't do that.
<br/>  
-I thought you were off today.
-I need to tell you something.
<br/>  
Last week I went on a date with Lisa P.
She asked me out.
<br/>  
It was nothing. We kissed a little bit
at the end of the date,
<br/>  
and I felt her breast a little bit,
but nothing else.
<br/>  
Right. No intercourse?
<br/>  
No. No intercourse.
<br/>  
Look, I'm sorry, it's just... You and I
never talked about being exclusive.
<br/>  
I don't want to see her again, okay?
You're the one I...
<br/>  
Look, we'll both be in New York soon,
and I want to hang out with you.
<br/>  
I want to get to know you better,
<br/>  
if you want to get to know me better
as well.
<br/>  
James, you don't owe me anything.
<br/>  
I know, but I want to owe you things.
<br/>  
I'm ready to owe you things, okay?
Because I really, really care about you.
<br/>  
-Are you mad at me? 'Cause I'm sorry.
-No, no. I'm not mad at you.
<br/>  
Thanks for telling me.
That was, like, really sweet.
<br/>  
-Are you crazy? You can't come here.
-I just can't do this anymore.
<br/>  
I'm starting to really
fucking hate myself, you know?
<br/>  
Oh, Christ.
My wife probably heard me come in.
<br/>  
Just... I gotta...
We'll find someplace to talk.
<br/>  
I gotta go make an excuse.
Park outside my mom's house, okay?
<br/>  
-Okay.
-All right.
<br/>  
Brennan. Yo, Brennan.
Come here!
<br/>  
Brennan, you gotta hear this.
Tell him. Tell him what you told me.
<br/>  
I ate too many circus peanuts.
<br/>  
No, what? No, not that, retard.
The other thing, the thing about Em.
<br/>  
Frigo, shut up.
Wait, what thing about Em?
<br/>  
I saw Em and Connell in his car.
<br/>  
Right, right.
What were they doing in the car, Rich?
<br/>  
They were doing push-ups in his car.
They didn't have any pants on.
<br/>  
No pants.
Naked push-ups, retard, for fucking.
<br/>  
-James, they were fucking.
-Frigo, Frigo. Shut up.
<br/>  
-When did you see this, Rich?
-Like, a while ago, a while ago.
<br/>  
It was just a couple
of weeks ago, right, Rich?
<br/>  
-Hello?
-Mr. Lewin, it's James. Is Emily there?
<br/>  
She said she was with you.
She said she was gonna go meet you.
<br/>  
Oh, yeah.
I think we got our wires crossed.
<br/>  
Okay, bye.
<br/>  
What'd he say?
<br/>  
Can you get your mother's car?
<br/>  
All right, I got the keys. Push me out.
<br/>  
I don't want to drink.
<br/>  
Did you know James went out
with Lisa P. last week?
<br/>  
-I know.
-You know.
<br/>  
-You want me to rat out James?
-Right.
<br/>  
-Slow down.
-Shit.
<br/>  
It's Em's car.
<br/>  
Let's wait here.
<br/>  
I stole some of my grandma's
cough medicine if you want some.
<br/>  
-No.
-It's grape.
<br/>  
-No, please.
-Okay.
<br/>  
Can you sit down, please,
just for a second?
<br/>  
-Look, you want to end this?
-Yes.
<br/>  
I got a hockey stick in the back,
if you want to smash the windows.
<br/>  
-Frigo, shut the fuck up, okay?
-All right, okay, Brennan.
<br/>  
-Just trying to help.
-Oh, shit.
<br/>  
What are you doing here?
<br/>  
Are you and Connell, like...
<br/>  
It started in, like...
I didn't even know you when it...
<br/>  
How did you... What are you...
How did you find me here?
<br/>  
Lisa P. told me that Connell used to
take some other girl here last summer
<br/>  
to his mother's basement.
<br/>  
Right.
<br/>  
Yeah, I just, like, don't understand
how you could do this.
<br/>  
I came here to...
<br/>  
I know. I know I fucked up, too, okay?
<br/>  
I fucked up one time, and I fucking
told you about it, and you...
<br/>  
You think I'm, like, some fucking
pathetic idiot or something.
<br/>  
You're not a fucking idiot.
I'm a fucking idiot.
<br/>  
Yeah, that's right.
<br/>  
Shit.
<br/>  
I am the champion.
To the victor go the spoils.
<br/>  
-Here you go.
-What? What is this?
<br/>  
-Is it a banana?
-It's a banana with eyes.
<br/>  
I'd watch my mouth if I were you,
carnival boy.
<br/>  
Hey.
<br/>  
What's up?
<br/>  
I mean...
<br/>  
I actually feel sorry for them, you know.
<br/>  
Like, sneaking around
and lying to everybody.
<br/>  
It's, like, so pathetic.
He's a married man.
<br/>  
I know. I know.
<br/>  
Hey, Lisa, you can't, like,
tell anybody about this. Ever.
<br/>  
Of course, I would never.
<br/>  
Thanks.
<br/>  
Hey, Em, what's up?
<br/>  
Loving life, you know.
<br/>  
Hey, you know I play the drums?
<br/>  
I did this killer drum solo
at the high-school talent show once.
<br/>  
I played Limelight by Rush.
1, 2, 3, 4!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>  
Spin. Good night, Adventureland!
<br/>  
-What the fuck was that?
-You like musicians, right?
<br/>  
Hey, honey,
I'm running out of googly eyes.
<br/>  
Do you have any more over there?
<br/>  
Yeah, me, too, but I found these,
so I've just been sort of...
<br/>  
-Hey.
-Hey, Em! What's up?
<br/>  
I quit. See you.
<br/>  
Tommy, you think there's something
wrong with this car?
<br/>  
Have your father check it
<br/>  
because it's making
a funny squeaking sound.
<br/>  
I don't know what the problem is.
<br/>  
Shit-head!
<br/>  
Shake a leg and come aboard
the SS Adventureland.
<br/>  
I'm not friends with anybody.
How the hell would I know?
<br/>  
-I don't know.
-No way!
<br/>  
Em? Em Lewin?
<br/>  
Yes, yes, yes.
Can you believe that?
<br/>  
Em has been sleeping
with Connell all summer.
<br/>  
-I'm telling you, man.
-Connell is a freaking god.
<br/>  
-Hey, Lisa.
-Hey.
<br/>  
Hi. Look, I don't know what to say,
<br/>  
but everyone is talking about
Em and Connell.
<br/>  
Kelly's got such a big F-ing mouth.
<br/>  
I'm sorry because I gave you my word.
We were just so wasted that night.
<br/>  
You know I can't hide nothing
from Kell.
<br/>  
Are you mad at me?
<br/>  
Well, yeah.
Connell's gonna freak out, and Em quit.
<br/>  
I feel bad for Connell.
I have a hard time feeling sorry for Em.
<br/>  
Guys can't help themselves.
<br/>  
-But he's the married one.
-Yeah, Em's a frigging home wrecker.
<br/>  
-He's cheating on his wife, though.
-I can't believe you're defending her.
<br/>  
What? Because guys can be shitty
and women can't?
<br/>  
The Musik-Express!
<br/>  
The Musik-Express!
<br/>  
Kell.
<br/>  
It's fun because it's really more
like dancing than exercising, you know.
<br/>  
I have a blast. I've been trying to
get him to go with me, but he won't go.
<br/>  
No, you're not doing it right.
<br/>  
Yeah, I don't like lifting my knees
that high.
<br/>  
Yeah, I've noticed.
<br/>  
Emily, you know the Ostrows
and the Waldsteins.
<br/>  
Hi there.
<br/>  
Can I get anyone a refresher?
<br/>  
Francy, these pieces, I love them.
So great.
<br/>  
Those there? I love those.
I think they are so fun.
<br/>  
You're so artsy.
I love what you've done with the house.
<br/>  
-Thank you.
-It's... It's clean.
<br/>  
I thought the house was a lot nicer
the way my mom used to have it.
<br/>  
It's pretty barfarific, if you ask me.
<br/>  
-Is that some kind of joke, Emily?
-No, it's not.
<br/>  
I think you owe me an apology.
Right now.
<br/>  
I don't owe you shit.
<br/>  
All right, okay. You know what?
Give me the drink.
<br/>  
Look, you weren't invited,
and I don't want you here, okay?
<br/>  
-Right, I wasn't invited to this party.
-Yes, you weren't invited,
<br/>  
and frankly,
I don't like you coming in here
<br/>  
and saying
whatever the hell you want, okay?
<br/>  
I am sick and tired of your behavior,
you ungrateful little bitch.
<br/>  
-Give me the drink.
-Okay, Em...
<br/>  
God damn it!
<br/>  
Emily! Emily, this has to stop.
You cannot say those things no more.
<br/>  
I can't say what I'm thinking
<br/>  
and what I'm feeling every fucking day?
<br/>  
-Sy, for God's sake!
-I can't force her out.
<br/>  
Yeah? Well maybe you can't...
<br/>  
Sometimes I feel so happy
<br/>  
Hey, can I have another? Thanks.
<br/>  
Sometimes I feel so happy
<br/>  
But mostly you just make me mad
<br/>  
Baby, you just make me mad
<br/>  
Linger on
<br/>  
Your pale blue eyes
<br/>  
Linger on
<br/>  
Your pale blue eyes
<br/>  
Oh, fuck!
<br/>  
James, get out of the car.
<br/>  
Now!
<br/>  
Oh, God. Come with me.
<br/>  
You care to explain how
Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron got here?
<br/>  
Good morning.
<br/>  
What's this, mister?
<br/>  
What the hell is wrong with you?
<br/>  
You know, I think that Adventureland
has made you regress or something.
<br/>  
You're quitting that job.
<br/>  
-I never want to go back there again.
-Good. How much have you saved?
<br/>  
$1,322, give or take.
<br/>  
Well, the front axle is broken,
but that might cover the damage.
<br/>  
And you're gonna have to pay
for Mrs. Frigo's rhododendron, too.
<br/>  
I need every cent of that for New York.
<br/>  
Well, I'm sorry, you know,
you should have thought about that
<br/>  
before you went out
on this little joyride of yours.
<br/>  
Brennan, I'm back.
<br/>  
Thank God. How the hell are you?
<br/>  
Well, Europe changed me.
It was revelatory.
<br/>  
There I was, going from
one incredible city to the next.
<br/>  
The ruins, the cathedrals,
the endless art treasures.
<br/>  
And I realized something.
<br/>  
Fuck the Old World.
I want the New World.
<br/>  
-What?
-And I want it now!
<br/>  
-What do you mean?
-I'm going to Harvard Business.
<br/>  
You're what? You're applying?
<br/>  
No, I'm in, actually. You know,
strings were pulled, wheels greased.
<br/>  
Wait, that's in Boston.
<br/>  
What about New York
and the apartment?
<br/>  
Yeah. Sorry about that, man.
I can't really help you out there.
<br/>  
Hey, litterbug. Hey! In the clown mouth.
These guys.
<br/>  
-Hey, Bobby, Paulette.
-Hey, Brennan.
<br/>  
Hey, how are you?
<br/>  
You know, we're just...
It's the last weekend of the season.
<br/>  
Just getting ready for winter,
closing up shop.
<br/>  
We have to turn all these lights off.
<br/>  
-Your check's in the office.
-Okay.
<br/>  
We gonna see you next summer?
<br/>  
Thank you, Bobby, for everything.
Really.
<br/>  
-Gonna see you next summer.
-Well, thank you, really.
<br/>  
We're halfway through our set,
<br/>  
and we see him. It's fucking Lou Reed.
<br/>  
-Oh, my...
-Holy shit!
<br/>  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
And I keep thinking
<br/>  
I'm about to wake up any second.
<br/>  
And he gets up, gets on stage,
puts on a guitar,
<br/>  
and we do a whole fucking set
of his songs.
<br/>  
-We do Vicious, Shed A Light On Love.
-Oh, my God.
<br/>  
-What a pisser.
-We do I'm Waiting For The Man.
<br/>  
Wait, hold on, one second.
<br/>  
-Hey, last paycheck?
-Yep.
<br/>  
So, how's it going?
<br/>  
-Ronnie found out everything.
-Sorry.
<br/>  
Yeah, it was bad.
It's blown over now, mostly.
<br/>  
Hey, do you speak to Em?
<br/>  
Not since she quit. You?
<br/>  
You know the song is called
Satellite of Love, the Lou Reed song.
<br/>  
You said Shed A Light On Love,
but it's Satellite.
<br/>  
-Yeah, I know. It's Satellite Of Love.
-Yeah, it's like Skylab.
<br/>  
Yeah, I know, it's...
Yeah, it's called Satellite Of Love.
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
Take care of yourself, Brennan.
<br/>  
Yeah, you, too.
<br/>  
-Where were we?
-You were telling us about the...
<br/>  
-Satellite Of Love.
-Yeah. Yeah.
<br/>  
That's what we were talking about.
<br/>  
That's my favorite one!
<br/>  
Yeah, it's a good tune.
<br/>  
Yes! We got the Viet Cong, fellas.
We got the Viet Cong here!
<br/>  
I need suppressive fire,
but I can handle it.
<br/>  
I think I got this under control.
<br/>  
-Your friend Eric boned you, huh?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
How are you gonna
pull off New York now?
<br/>  
I can't pull it off. I'm stuck here.
<br/>  
What's the point of being a writer
or an artist anyway?
<br/>  
Herman Melville wrote
fucking Moby Dick,
<br/>  
and he was so poor and forgotten
by the time he died
<br/>  
that in his obituary,
they called him Henry Melville.
<br/>  
You know? Like, why bother?
<br/>  
They're just gonna forget
our fucking names anyway.
<br/>  
Viet Cong, Viet Cong! I'm coming!
<br/>  
I got it!
<br/>  
I heard Em went back to New York.
<br/>  
I wish it didn't end like that.
I should've...
<br/>  
I don't know.
<br/>  
Get behind me. Boom!
<br/>  
I got 2! There's 1! There's 2!
What's that?
<br/>  
Boom! Boom! Boom, baby, boom!
<br/>  
Your Herman Melville story,
that's bullshit.
<br/>  
It's true. They called him Henry.
<br/>  
No, I mean he wrote
a 700-page allegorical novel
<br/>  
about the whaling industry.
I think he was...
<br/>  
I think he was
a pretty passionate guy, Joel.
<br/>  
I hope they call me Henry
when I die, too.
<br/>  
Yeah? One can only hope.
<br/>  
Brennan, don't get all drunk
and fall asleep.
<br/>  
-Why?
-Because I'll jack off on your face.
<br/>  
-Okay, I'm gonna go.
-What?
<br/>  
I'll see you around, Frigo.
<br/>  
All right.
<br/>  
Good luck with him. Even.
<br/>  
Good one!
<br/>  
That was nice, Brennan. That was nice.
<br/>  
That must have hurt.
<br/>  
Look me in the eye
<br/>  
Then tell me that I'm satisfied
<br/>  
Hey, are you satisfied?
<br/>  
And it goes so slowly on
<br/>  
Everything I've ever wanted
<br/>  
Tell me what's wrong
<br/>  
Look me in the eye
<br/>  
And tell me that I'm satisfied
<br/>  
Were you satisfied?
<br/>  
Hi. I just got off the bus.
I'm a New Yorker now.
<br/>  
I guess I should
probably buy an umbrella.
<br/>  
I don't think I can see you.
<br/>  
What?
<br/>  
This summer was rough.
<br/>  
I did things that I really, really regret.
<br/>  
Yeah, me, too.
<br/>  
I'm sorry I told Lisa P.
about you and Connell.
<br/>  
She, you know,
told the rest of the world, but...
<br/>  
I'm not gonna lie.
I was really angry at you,
<br/>  
but you didn't deserve that.
<br/>  
You know, James,
<br/>  
I am so sorry for fucking this up.
<br/>  
You know, you were the only good
thing that happened this summer.
<br/>  
Wait, Em.
<br/>  
I think I maybe see you
a little differently than you see yourself.
<br/>  
Yes, I see the person who fucked up,
but I also see the person
<br/>  
who saved me from being knifed
over a giant-ass panda,
<br/>  
who introduced me
to psychotropic-chocolate-chip cookies,
<br/>  
and who stood up for Joel, and
who doesn't make apologies for herself.
<br/>  
Look, my theory is you can't just avoid
everybody you screw up with.
<br/>  
And you should trust me.
I'm a New Yorker.
<br/>  
-You are soaking wet.
-Yeah.
<br/>  
Do you have anything else
you can wear?
<br/>  
I'll check.
<br/>  
-Do you want some tea?
-Yeah.
<br/>  
No, everything in here is soaking wet.
<br/>  
-Here.
-Thanks.
<br/>  
So you're going to Columbia?
<br/>  
No. No. Maybe next year. No.
<br/>  
Why?
<br/>  
I wrecked my dad's car,
and I lost all my carny money.
<br/>  
So what's the plan?
<br/>  
I'm gonna crash at the Y for a week.
I'm gonna look for a shitty job and...
<br/>  
I don't know.
<br/>  
Here. Give me your shirt.
<br/>  
-I'll get you another shirt.
-Thanks.
<br/>  
Hey, Em.
<br/>  
I really missed you.
<br/>  
You wanna wear this?
<br/>  
I... No. No.
I never wanna see that again.
<br/>  
Why do you have that?
Why do you have that stupid shirt?
<br/>  
Is it okay that I did that?
<br/>  
Yeah.
<br/>  
-Are we doing this?
-I think so.
<br/>  
Okay, we are? Okay.
<br/>  
Okay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
