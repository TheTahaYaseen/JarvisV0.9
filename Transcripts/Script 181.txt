(narrator) Fairy tales tell,
as their labels imply,
<br/>
<br/>
stories of magic, of creatures that fly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With giants and dragons
and ogres and elves,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and inanimate objects
that speak for themselves.

There's romance and danger
and plotting of schemes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's good guys and bad guys
and some guys in between.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A fairy tale also reveals some sort of truth,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the perils of choices we face in our youth.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But our story today is different in theme,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
for our hero had no choice,
or so it would seem.

- There, now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on. All the way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l gotta work on that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, ladies!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- She gives the worst gifts.
- Not if she can't find the baby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda here. Fairy par excellence.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, where's the baby?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Out walking.
- At her grandmother's.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- At her grandmother's.
- Out for a walk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- She's walking, at her grandmother's.
- Either way, as you see, she's not here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(baby cries)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, look. She's back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What shall we give
this beautiful little child today?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What's her name again?
- Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not a very well-behaved
little stinker, is she?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Quiet, please. l can't concentrate here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell,
l give you the gift of obedience.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, go to sleep.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, wake up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- lsn't it wonderful?
- No, it's terrible.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's a terrible gift to have to do
what you're told. Take it back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have a no-return policy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And if you're going to be ungrateful, l can
always turn her into a squirrel instead.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- A squirrel?
- No, obedience is a lovely gift.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, you should thank me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've just given you the perfect child.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ln spite of the spell,
Ella grew up strong of mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Her gift made her obedient,
but her heart made her kind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you go back
to where you came from?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Yeah.
- Areida. What a stupid name.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Nobody wants you here.
- l do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bite me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did you just see what Ella did?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l made your favorite,
so dig in and stuff your face.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm gonna get forks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sweetie, stop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l always knew
something was wrong with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't you take the spell back?
You're a fairy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm only a household fairy, honey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, according to fairy guidelines,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
only the fairy who gave you the gift
can take it back, and we've begged her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not only that, but she said
she'd turn your mother into a squirrel
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and take away my eternal youth
if we ever asked her again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's not fair.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l know, darling. l know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So Ella now knew
why she'd always obeyed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But she never stopped fighting
to have things her way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella! Come practice your mandolin.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fine, but l'll take
my own sweet time doing it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hurry up, now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As she struggled
to find a way out of her gift,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
she had no way of knowing
something worse was adrift.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please get well, Mother.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only Mandy and l know about the gift.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We've never even told your father.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you must never tell anyone else.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l don't want anyone using it against you.
- Mother, please.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Remember, no matter
what anyone says or tells you to do,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
look to yourself, Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take this, then l'll always be with you.

- You're married?
- She has money, Ella.

And she's very fond of my title.

lt was either get married or sell the house.

You'll adore Dame Olga,
and her two daughters.

<br/>
She'll make a wonderful mother.

<br/>
Well, a motherlike figure.

<br/>

ls this the right address?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There must be some mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dear, welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And these must be your lovely daughters.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My precious Hattie and my special Olive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- And you must be Ella.
- Pleased to meet you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. The house looks delightful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But l do seem to remember
that at the noblemen's convention
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you said that you lived in a castle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, l said a man's home is his castle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi. l'm Ella. Welcome to Frell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's with the prince pinups?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hattie's president
of the Prince Char fan club.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Char and his uncle are responsible
for the segregation of the kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So? He's dreamy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ls this hutch meant to be a closet?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's pathetic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My clothes need more room than this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- We'll have to use yours.
- Wha...?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Show it to us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's so... quaint.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Almost like, well, it's just ugly, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's no room in here, either.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're gonna have to throw out
some of your gowns to make room.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Wait. Get away from there!
- You get away.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's this? l do actually like this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please don't touch it. lt was my mother's.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Can l have it?
- No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt can be your welcome gift to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come on, hand it over.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aren't you accommodating.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(giggling)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second l sell the last of these,
l'll be back. l promise.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l know it's not a great job,
not even a good job -
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, even a monkey could do it -
but we need the money, Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l'll miss you, Father.
- l'll miss you, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Hattie) Hey, Olive, we should call her
Ella the Smella from Frella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(giggling)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elves, giants, ogres and humans
used to exist in harmony,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but when King Florian was killed,
allegedly by an ogre,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sir Edgar saw it as an opportunity to exile
all nonhuman creatures to the forest,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
keeping their land for himself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Passionately put, Ella.
Give yourself a pat on the back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(giggling)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(teacher) Hattie?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What my unworthy opponent fails to realize
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is Sir Edgar has done a fantastic job.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He has driven the ogres out,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and he has put giants and elves to work
as laborers and entertainers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, if it weren't for him,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we wouldn't have today's
thriving free-enterprise system.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's only free because we've enslaved the
poor creatures and they work for nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edgar is a monster, and l don't hold out
much hope for his nephew, either.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, that shows what you know,
aka nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Char will be the greatest king ever.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Right, girls?
- (all) Yeah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l wonder if my opponent has based
her opinion on the prince's politics
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or how cute she thinks his butt is.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Admit you're stupid
and don't know what you're talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm stupid and l don't know
what l'm talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(teacher) Ella?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, in conclusion...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hold your tongue, Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(teacher) Ella!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My tongue itches.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(teacher) lf you're not going to take this
seriously, l declare Hattie the winner.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(applause)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ya!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uncle, do l have to go to this mall opening?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As heir to the throne,
it's your royal responsibility, Char.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You are a public figure, after all.
- Yes, but you're the one in charge.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only for a little while longer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your coronation is next week.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You need to be out there
with the people, Char.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, shaking hands and kissing babies.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Exactly, Heston.
So the people can learn to trust us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's not to trust?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But while you've been away at school,
Char, the kingdom has been under siege.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ln your absence,
the ogres have become impossible.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's right. Even the giants have become
more and more treacherous.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But the giants have always been peaceful.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ogres were peaceful too,
until they ripped your father to shreds.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l promised your father,
should anything happen to him,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l would take care of you and the kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, well, l've kept my promise, haven't l?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, you must keep
your promise to the people.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, let's put on a smile.
Remember, image is everything.

And l've no intention of curtsying,

You can curtsy or not. That's your choice.
There's really nothing l can do about it.

Except have you beheaded,
but that seems a bit extreme.
<br/>

what your people usually do?

Steal my land and destroy my livelihood.

Wait a second. Come back here.

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, Ella of Frell,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you're the first maiden l've met
who hasn't swooned at the sight of me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then maybe l've done you some good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look, l've never stolen
anyone's land or livelihood.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l want peace in the kingdom
as much as anyone.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So you have a new plan
once you take the crown?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sort of. Of course,
l couldn't reveal it to a subject.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's what l thought.
You're all just the same.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You care more about your fan club
and your next jousting tournament.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, actually, l've never been comfortable
with the whole adoring fan club thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps that's why l find
your obvious disdain for me so refreshing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Obvious? And l was trying
so hard to hide it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where's my purse? lt's back there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait right there. l will get it.

Your Highness.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you crazy? Why didn't you move?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l would have... were it not for your apparent
fascination with knocking me to the ground.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's the second time today, you realize.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'll try and be more considerate
next time l'm saving you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next time? What makes you think
we'll see each other again?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, won't we?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell, you are not like other girls.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have no idea.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella, come here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shouldn't you be at home
cleaning the fireplace, huh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop flirting with him.
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Ella.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother with her. Ugh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm the one you want.
l know everything about you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've got posters of you, and pictures.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And when we used to live in Lamia,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l used to stand outside your castle and
watch you turn your lights on and off.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tell Ella l'll be in touch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right. l'll see to that.
<br/>
<br/>

- Where were you?
- Oh.

<br/>

- l met the prince.
- You met the prince?
<br/>

Olive and Hattie were there.

- l don't.
- Tell the truth.

Oh, l do.

<br/>
<br/>
No, not really.

Have you noticed it gets darker at night,
then lighter when the sun comes up?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That's because of Ella?
- Never mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You've been acting odd, even for you.
- What do you mean?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh... Don't let her see me.
- That's what l mean.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aha.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Areida, no!
- Ella, come here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have to go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- l need you to do me a little favor.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cool! Let me try! Take that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that potion bottle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK! OK, that's enough.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think that's for me to say, Ella.
We need one more thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take those.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Please don't make me do this.
- Well, since you said please...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. Take them. Take them!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Run!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop that girl!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Buy a squirrel sandwich.
Get 'em while they're hot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here. Keep the change.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Coming through.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Try our new perfume.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella, bravo!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Freeze!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Put your hands together.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're under arrest.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A felon in my own family.
l could die from embarrassment.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Promises, promises.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You are a disgrace.
- Maybe she was put up to it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mandy's right, Mother. We were there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt really wasn't poor Ella's fault at all.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was forced to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, Ella, who put you up to it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (whispers) Tell her it was Areida.
- Ar...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm waiting. Tell me who's to blame.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Areida.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Areida! l might have guessed it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You are forbidden ever to see her again.
- What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Areida) Ella?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How dare she come here now?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Answer the door and tell her
that you never want to see her again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And tell her you could never be friends
with an Ayorthian.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Dame Olga, there must be some mistake.
- Please, Dame Olga.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't argue. Just do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness you're all right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l never wanna see you again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ha-ha. Very funny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't understand.
We're best friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l could never be friends with an Ayorthian.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've done terrible things before, Mandy,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but this is the worst thing
the curse has ever made me do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've gotta do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have got to find Lucinda
and get her to take back the curse.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're right.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have something to show you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is gonna help you find her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l should have told you
about this years ago.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- But l was a little embarrassed.
- Embarrassed? How?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, as you know,
l'm not the most talented fairy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this book...
is my boyfriend, Benny.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pleased to meet you.
Pleased to meet anyone, quite frankly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're the first introduction
l've had in 20 years.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l've never seen anything like this.
- l know. No one has.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l don't want them to,
cos then they might take him away.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt was an accident. l was just trying a spell
to trim his hair, and it went a little askew.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l would have left her ages ago,
except l love her so darn much.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plus, l have no legs.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l love you, too, my little Pooky Pages.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not as much as l love you, Cuddlebuns.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l love you more.
- OK.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lots of love. Moving on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, l want you to take him with you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You mean l'm getting out of here?
Beyond these four walls?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are so many places in my pages
l've been wanting to visit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow. What is all this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He knows everything.
- Thanks, sweetie, but not everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf l did, l'd be a lot thicker.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can he show me anything about Lucinda?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Can l show you anything about Lucinda?
- Watch this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Show me Lucinda.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ta-da!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cool trick.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, which Crockery Barn?
They're all over the kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's the glitch. He can't tell you where
a person is. He can just show you pictures.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like a crystal ball or a magic mirror.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything is so huge.
ls that a wedding registry?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duh! They're in Giantville.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look, she's going
to a wedding in Giantville.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Benny, we're going to Giantville.
- How exciting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
( Olga) Ella, the girls and l need bouquets
for our portrait sitting tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Go and pick some.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d What you want, baby, I got it
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d What you need, cos you know I got it
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d All I'm asking is for a little respect
when you get home, baby
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, as her stepfamily scratched
their newly found itches,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella was off, glad to be rid of the... witches.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Benny, can you show me a map
of the Forest of Pim?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
According to this map,
if we head due east towards Monster Rock,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we can cut half a day off our journey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(yelp)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What was that?
- Probably something that wants to eat us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ouch!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (man) Somebody help me!
- (man laughs)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Wait a minute.
- (man) Sing soprano, little man!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Missed!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What do you think
you're doing to that poor elf?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who's this who thinks she's so tough?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look, l think it's only fair to warn you that
l'm practiced in the ancient art... of origami.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Paper folding?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l was hoping
you wouldn't know what that was.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't let him scare you, sweetheart!
Kick his butt!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Don't let her do that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now rabbit punch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Combo. Kneel. Front-step kick.
Dragon-roundhouse kick.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This chick is nuts!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's get outta here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think l'm gonna puke.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let me help you with that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l am gonna need
so much therapy after this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Are you OK?
- No, l am not OK!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think l broke something,
or dislocated it, or...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(crunch)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, just a crick. Slannen of Pim.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell. Nice to meet you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, if you're OK,
then l have to be going, but good luck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're going? You can't walk in this wood
on your own. How about a bite to eat?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's very sweet,
but l'm on a tight schedule.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fine. Message received,
Miss <i>l Think l'm All That</i>.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That's not what l meant at all.
- l extend the hand of friendship...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l am on a tight schedule. Were l not...
- Everybody's busy...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- ..l would love to have dinner with you.
- Great! l've got a coupon.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(whispers) Slannen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf this is where you live,
why are we sneaking around?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf they spot you, you'll be sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know how all elves
are forced to sing and dance?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. So?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Visitors!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Places, everyone.
- One, two, three, four!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Run for it!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Let us entertain you,
let us make you smile
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Let us give you a few tricks,
some old and then some new tricks
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d We're very versatile
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d And if you're real good
we'll make you feel good
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d We want your spirits high
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Ella) Where are we going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Slannen) l said get lost!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d We'll have a real good time
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Leave us alone!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Peace and quiet at last.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Jeremiah was a bullfrog
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d He was a good friend of mine
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hit the road.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Hit the road, Jack, and don't you...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get outta here!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(waitress) l need this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What is this, anyway? Ella's secret diary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Why don't you like music?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's right. Because elves are supposed
to be so happy and joyful all the time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Singing and dancing for the man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't wanna be an entertainer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l wanna be a...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What were you gonna say?
- lt's silly.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l wanna be a lawyer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l guess in small-claims court.
- What is that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nothing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Why can't you be a lawyer?
- Hello?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Elf.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l forgot. The elfin restrictions
Sir Edgar passed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No elf shall be engaged in any occupation
other than singing, juggling
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
andlor tomfoolery.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're never gonna let me
go to law school.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm never gonna get my day in court,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
never gonna stand
in front of the judge and say
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>You're out of order!</i>
Permission to approach the bench?<i></i>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- <i>l object!</i>
- No, l object.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l heard it there. lt's coming from the book.
- No, it's not.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Great. l knew it. A talking book.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good. Because for a minute there,
l thought l was going crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Crazy
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d l'm crazy for feeling so lonely
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What are you doing with Ella's things?
- Just a little tidying up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What's that?
- What? Nothing. lt's personal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A letter for Ella?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The prince's coronation ball.
He's invited that insolent little snip?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Girls, go and dust off your ball gowns
and pack your bags.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think l may have found you
another chance at your future husband.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So you can really show me anything
anywhere in the kingdom?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're kind of like a walking, talking
encyclopedia, except for the walking part.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Come on.
- What?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edgar's soldiers rounding up elfin singers
to perform at the coronation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get in. And you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen, you've gotta go to Lamia
and petition the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- For what?
- To go to law school. You gotta stop this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d The sun will shine
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Slannen) You want me to go
to Lamia on my own?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're going to Giantville.
lt's on the way. Come with us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The prince will never grant an audience
with an elf. They think we're a joke.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have met Prince Charmont, and l think
he might be different than his uncle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Why? Cos he's a hunk?
- No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What is he, about six foot?
- About.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, l hate the guy already.
l'm not wasting my time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lacking courage as well as height.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Count me in.
Elves aren't that short, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's just a myth created by that stupid
Elves and the Shoemaker story.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Do l look small enough to fit in a shoe?
- No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
Are you sure he knows where he's going?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey, l'm right here. Just cos l'm a book
doesn't mean l don't have ears.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Boys, if you can't play nice,
you can't play together.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(rustling)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no. The rustling always comes
before the screaming and the running.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l knew this was gonna happen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll just find pieces of us
scattered across the forest floor.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a bunny. You know, the last known
case of a bunny attack was, well, never.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt never hurts to be on your guard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(twig snaps)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nobody panic, nobody panic.
l've got this in hand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oi!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You! Thumper!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Out of the forest or no more carrots for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't like carrots.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you feel about rabbits,
cos one just went thataway.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l am the ogre, Nish.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you like to be eaten?
Baked, boiled, shish-kebabbed?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about free range?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop! No!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell. Hi, how are you doing?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think there's been a big mistake here.
See, l'm pro-ogre.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Pro-ogre?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. l led a rally on your behalf
the other day. Maybe you heard about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt'll only hurt for a moment, l promise.
l'm a fast eater.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen, Slannen!
Please, l want to help.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Help? From a human?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Humans took everything from us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l was an ogre of leisure, with a simple life.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Next thing you know...
- Now, not this again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nish, hurry up. l'm starving.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right, you, into the pot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Forget that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Who are you?
- l am the ogre, Nish.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just did this. Didn't we just do this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right, that's enough fun and games.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, keep your mouth shut
and don't move.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ls it boiling yet?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's not gonna boil
if you stand there looking at it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You couldn't show a picture
of a big ogre heading our way?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- That would have been helpful.
- Oh! Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think l see bubbles.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(horse neighs)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let her go!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Untie yourself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Truce! Truce!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can't we just get along?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you one of the monsters
who killed my father?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
King Florian was a good man.
We lived in peace during his reign.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why would we kill him?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'll spare your lives
where you didn't spare his.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You take your friends
and find breakfast elsewhere.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll pick up something else on the way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you eat maiden,
an hour later you're hungry again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing here,
with an elf for protection?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you get a kick
out of near-death experiences?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. l was fine. l had things well in hand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l could see that, as you were dangling
over the boiling cauldron,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
no doubt lulling the ogres
into a false sense of security.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who's to say it wouldn't have worked
if you hadn't come barging in?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l see the score currently stands
at chivalry two, gratitude zero.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Look...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're right. l'm sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You're bleeding.
- Hm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's just a scratch.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'd better let me help you with that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- So, will l live?
- l think the odds are in your favor.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So... where were you headed?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The giants' village for a wedding.
l'm meeting my godmother.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's on our way back to Lamia.
We'll accompany you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's not necessary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt makes it so much easier rescuing you
if l don't have to commute.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm so glad l was here
for this interesting development.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Heston groans)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Look, l really appreciate the offer, but...
- Are you crazy? Tell him to come with us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come with us.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, traveling with an elf?
Your boyfriend couldn't make it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Because l don't have one.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your girlfriend doesn't mind
being left alone?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l don't have a girlfriend.
- Oh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l have many.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm kidding. Shouldn't believe
everything you read in Medieval Teen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Excuse me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Charmont, permission to speak?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Sure.
- You know the word coincidence?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt just so happens l was on my way
to meet a certain royal someone
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in order to discuss some career options
currently unavailable to...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen wants to petition the kingdom
for the right to become a lawyer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- A lawyer?
- Why not?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There were no laws against it
when your father was king.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's not really my area of expertise.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My advice to you
would be to talk to my uncle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm sure if you make a good argument,
he'll come round.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, thank you for your... advice.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- You're about to become king.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'll have the power to make a difference
in the world and you don't even care.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's not like l asked to become king.
l've had no say in the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, thanks to your uncle, there are a lot
of people who have no say in the matter.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nobody should be forced to do things
they don't wanna do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Take it from somebody who knows.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella! Ella!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're not finished yet.
You work until sundown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
( Char) The giants have always been
gentle. Why are they treated like slaves?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm sure my uncle doesn't know about this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He couldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(lively music)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Ella) Maybe you can get
to the bottom of this at the wedding.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
( Char) Maybe you can find
your godmother.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Ella) Whoa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They're not so bad.
l thought they'd be all so big and scary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Didn't hurt.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l hope this is a good idea.
They must hate the royal family.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They'll respect your courage
at showing up here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides, they don't hold grudges.
They're bigger than that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Charmont.
What are you doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No grudges, eh?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, l thought that maybe this would be a
good time to possibly have a heart-to-heart.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But now l'm thinking l should come back
when there's been a little less drinking.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's here as a friend
to hear your complaints.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm looking for someone.
My godmother, Lucinda.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was over there earlier.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. l'll be right back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. ls Lucinda Perriweather here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too late, sweetheart.
She left about an hour ago.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where l can find her?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last l heard,
she was somewhere living in Lamia.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you know where the bathroom is?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Benny, show me Lucinda.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looks like she's getting an FWl.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- FWl?
- Flying while intoxicated.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- She could be anywhere.
- Ow!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Agh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ooh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'd no idea things were so bad.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l promise, first thing after my coronation,
l'll help you buy your farms back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'll hold you to that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l'm sorry to interrupt.
- No problem. We were done.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's a fine young man you have here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's not fine. l mean, mine. He is fine...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Never mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So have you seen Slannen?
We have to leave.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My godmother's on some kind of bender.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can't leave now.
lt's the middle of the night.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have to stay for the party.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, l'll stay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l appreciate your enthusiasm,
but you don't have to stay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't wanna make you do
anything you don't wanna do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Char. For everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So l'll see you around?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But l wish you would stay.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l guess one more night wouldn't hurt.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mmm. Yuck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So you're looking
for your godmother Lucinda?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was supposed to be here,
and now l have no idea where she is,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and l need to find her
as soon as possible bec...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because l miss her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Did you think of trying the hall of records?
- No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have every year's census in the castle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's not open to everyone,
but l could probably pull a few strings.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Char, l can't tell you
what that would mean to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, then, it's settled.
You come with me to Lamia tomorrow.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l gotta hide. They're after me.
- Who?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The giants.
They want me to sing. l don't sing!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There he is. There's our little entertainer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr Koopooduk, l know you may find this
hard to believe, but Slannen doesn't sing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Well, how about you, then?
- Me? Oh, no. l couldn't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Now, come on.
- Please don't.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sing.
<br/>

(applause and cheering)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l love singers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Really?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because, you know,
being an elf, l love to sing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, l hope
you don't mind me saying this,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but you're much prettier
than l would have expected.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, l know. Giants are supposed
to be big, ugly and mean.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's because of stories
like Jack and the Beanstalk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stinking Grimm Brothers.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've seen weirder couples.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
None that immediately come to mind,
but still.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My stepsister Hattie would die
if she knew l was here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She's the president
of your fan club, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Hattie, yes. Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now l know what name
to put on the restraining order.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, you're lucky.
l wish l had brothers and sisters.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother passed away
before she had any more children and...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother passed away, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know, she used to sing me
to sleep every night.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My father used to sing to me,
loudly and very off-key, but...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l still miss him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have Edgar, l guess.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He's not such a bad guy.
He risked his life to save my father.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And he brought me up as his own son.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l know you don't like his politics much,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but l'm sure when l tell him about
the giants, he will correct the situation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, or you could.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt took a lot of guts for you to come here.
Look at the way you smoothed things over.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're a natural at this.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow, is that almost a compliment?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Almost. Now, don't go getting a big head.
Your crown won't fit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You know what else?
Tomorrow l'm gonna go to my uncle
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and l'm gonna ask him
to repeal the elfin restrictions.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen will have his day in court,
if l have anything to say about it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think you're gonna be
a great king someday.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your father would have been proud.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think he would have really liked you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kiss me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That wasn't an order, you know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l want to look 25 at tonight's ball.
What do you suggest?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A time machine?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
May l recommend our newest procedure?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bat faeces and oxen blood.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Batox.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Works wonders, although l do caution you,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
some people have
a temporarily bad reaction.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Olga.
- Peter, what are you doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm in town on business and heard
you were here. l came to see Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- ls Ella here?
- Of course. Where else would she be?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She's... she's... with Hattie and Olive,
taking a tour of the castle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Next we move into the castle lobby.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l can't believe it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Char walked on this actual floor!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ladies, ladies, ladies!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Stop tonguing the foyer.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(all groan)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Show us where Char showers.
- (excited giggling)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l bet he showers naked!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Hold it, pipsqueak.
- l'm with the prince. And l'm not that short.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Are you singing at the coronation?
- Heck, no.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No elves in the palace
unless they're performing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Discrimination. lntentional infliction of...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
..bodily harm.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These portraits
were recently commissioned
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in honor of tomorrow's coronation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(women gasp)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(women scream)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right, follow me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are they doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't mean to rush, but now l really need
to find my godmother, and Slannen, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Where is he?
- My uncle'll send the guards to find him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Everything's gonna be fine.
Don't forget, you are with the future king.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Char.
- Hello, Uncle.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l've been looking all over for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And who might
this charming young lady be?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is Ella. Ella of Frell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella, this is my Uncle Edgar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And this is his... Heston.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, l trust your journey was pleasant?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had a little run-in with some ogres,
but Char got the best of them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could have been killed.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well. One just has to grin and bear it,
l always say. Grin and bear it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, Char, might l trouble you
for a moment?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The crown maker needs to see you
in your chambers for a fitting.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sure. l just have to take Ella to the...
to the hall of records.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, well, hop to it, then, both of you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You were right about that girl. Very odd.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l'm afraid she's been
filling our prince's head
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
with dangerous new thoughts.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here's the latest census. Names are listed
first by location then species.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Good luck.
- Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorry l couldn't be of more help,
but l don't have a census.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l mean, look at the size of that thing.
l do have a restaurant guide.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda, l hope you're in here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella has lots of interesting opinions about
the kingdom, Uncle. You should hear them.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l can't wait.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The giants' working conditions,
for instance. They're unbelievable.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, l've talked to them
and they're definitely open for negotiation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The only negotiations between me and the
giants will be over our vegetable deliveries.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Heston laughs)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good one, sire.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This isn't a joke, Uncle Edgar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We'll talk about it
after your coronation, yes?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fine, but we will talk.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Of course.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l... l'm going to ask her to marry me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who? This... this Ella of Frell?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Tonight, at the ball.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the same time and in the same place
as my father proposed to my mother.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (Hattie) Get off! Do you know who l am?
- (guard) Come with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What now?
- (Hattie) Get off! Get off me!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- So, Ella of Frell is your sister.
- (Hattie drinks noisily through straw)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Stepsister, actually.
- Really?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me, what do you know about her?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's in it for me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How about that your eyeballs
remain inside your head?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, now, Heston.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We like these girls. They're our friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l can't find anything in any of these books.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Benny, show me Lucinda.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Benny) No, still sacked out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't know where else to...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don't we just cut to the chase, hm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l might even be willing
to throw Prince Char into the deal.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let's see, now. After the coronation
he'll need to take a queen,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and shall we say... his hand in marriage?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Queen Olive.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the eldest daughter, of course.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella does everything she's told.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't know why, but she does.
She can't help it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda Perriweather,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dun Flyin Retirement Community
for Faeries, Lamia Heights.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Benny! Benny, we got her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello, Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l hope you've found everything
to your satisfaction?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Yes, thank you.
- Good, good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, dear. How clumsy of me. Pick it up.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Very good.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now touch your toes.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes. And while you're about it,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
why don't you pat your head
and rub your tummy at the same time?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now jump up and down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Please stop.
- Wait.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you know this one.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Put your left foot in, your left foot out
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Put your left foot in
and shake it all about
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Shake, shake, shake,
shake, shake, shake
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
d Shake your booty, shake your booty
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is fabulous!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hate to be a party pooper,
but, Edgar, evil plans, remember?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you're right. OK, stop.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As you know, tonight is the coronation ball.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At some point,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
amidst your frolicking and romancing,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Prince Char will sweep you away
to the hall of mirrors.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, just before midnight,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
he will take you by the hand
and ask you a question.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How do you know all this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We know everything, my dear.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the one thing we know
with most certainty
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is that at the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and plunge it
through his heart and kill him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No! No, l won't!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes, you will.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will, because l order you to.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Edgar chuckles)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Actually, it's lucky you're here,
so l won't have to do it myself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You'd kill your own nephew?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not? l killed my own brother.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What? Why?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l want to be king.
- Duh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now go.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wait.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's one more thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will tell no one of this plan.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Can l help you?
- l'm looking for Lucinda Perriweather.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- lt's kind of urgent.
- Sorry. She was kicked out last week.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Do you know where l could find her?
- Nope.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't understand. lf l don't find her,
something terrible's going to happen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Finding her would be something terrible.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Ella) Dear Char.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the hardest thing I've ever
had to do, and I hope you'll understand.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We can't be together.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can't tell you why.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please believe
that this is the only solution.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish you the best.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I really do believe
you're going to be a great king.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Goodbye for ever. Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(narrator) Now, if she stayed clear
of the prince until midnight had passed,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
then Char would be safe.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But how long could that last?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen, where have you been?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What are you doing? Never mind.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This may sound strange,
but there's something l need you to do.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are one freaky chick.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l need you to go back into the forest and
rally all the elves and giants you can find.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- You want me to go back in there?
- You'll need all the help you can get.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone has to get into the castle, find
Benny and keep Char away from Edgar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Why? What's going on?
- l already told you, l can't tell you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But if you don't,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
you might very well be stuck
singing <i>Kumbaya</i> the rest of your life.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fine! lnto the forest of certain death
walks Slannen.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Thank you.
- Yeah, whatever.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(d waltz)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Where's your little friend?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. She should be here by now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't want to talk about her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(bell rings)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Agh! Oh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh! Oh!
- (tree creaks)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Slannen, please hurry.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you stop that?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When you steal from here,
you are stealing from me now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What do you mean?
- This is my future home, isn't it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (clears throat)
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi. l was just polishing...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(giggles)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Would you... would you care to dance?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are you kidding?
That's all she ever talks about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wanted to look younger.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf you spent less time on your face
and more on your maternal duties,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
we'd know where Ella was right now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(tree creaks)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(thunder)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ouch!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What the...?
This isn't the salad bar at Brelly's.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda. Lucinda! Lucinda!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my goodness. Do l know you, child?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell. You gave me a gift.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes. l remember you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- The obedient one.
- l am so happy to see you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l have been looking everywhere for you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l need you to take the gift back.
- Take it back? l don't think so.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's not that l'm not grateful for the gift.
l am, really.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But because of the gift,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm about to do something horrible
to this guy l really like and might even love.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Girl, you out of your mind.
Everybody loves my gifts.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lucinda! Lucinda, l am begging you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l will do anything you ask.
Please take it back.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You don't like my gift? Fine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Get rid of it yourself.
Don't blame me for your problems.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Did l chain your butt up to this tree, huh?
- Well...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Huh?
- But you...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, in fact, just to prove
what a gem l am... l'll unchain you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What? No! No!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Aren't l fabulous?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, look at you. A pretty girl like you
should be at the ball.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- Go get down with the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, l can't go!
- Well, not dressed like that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, that's what l'm talking about.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, that hurt.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Give, give, give.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You're welcome.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me about your sister.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Olive? ldiot.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, Ella.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't wanna talk about her.
She's so dreary.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l just wanna talk about us.
- Us?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt sounds even more wonderful
when you say it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Ella screams)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Hattie) Ow!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Something tells me
she just couldn't stay away.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- We need to talk.
- Char, please...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please tell me
you never wanna see me again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l will if you tell me that you don't love me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- lt's not that.
- Then why did you write me that letter?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tell me how you really feel about me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l love you. But l am wrong for you, Char.
l am wrong for the kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ls that what this is about?
Ella, that's crazy.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come with me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The hall of mirrors?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When l was little,
my father brought me in here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He told me to look in the mirror
and see myself as a great leader.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, l never could.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And then you come along.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella, what's wrong?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l wish l could tell you.
l wish l could tell you everything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These last few days have been so perfect.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, except for the bit
where we almost got eaten by ogres.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you wrote me a letter
that ripped my heart out.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l had to dance with Hattie.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But none of these things matter.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We're together now.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And when we're together, it's like magic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l never want it to end.
- l know, l know.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- And l feel the same, but...
- That's why l brought you here.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Char, please listen to me.
- Ella, l know. You're scared.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm scared, too.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is... this is a big step.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella of Frell, will you marry me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(clock chimes)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, no, no, no, no!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No?
- No.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l don't understand. What is it?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My politics? Your family?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because those things aren't important.
What's important is what's in our hearts.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf our love is strong,
we can conquer anything.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l do love you, Char.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (Hattie) Ella, come here.
- ( Olga) Don't argue. Just do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- ( Olive) Take that.
- Keep your mouth shut.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (Hattie) Take those.
- (ogre) Don't move.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Edgar) On the stroke of midnight
you will take this dagger
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and plunge it through his heart
and kill him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What's inside you
is stronger than any spell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will no longer be obedient.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You will no longer be obedient!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(clock strikes midnight)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm free. l can't believe it. l'm free.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You tried to kill me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guards!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- No, Char...
- Take her away.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, Char, please.
Please, Char, wait. No, Char!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Char, please, wait.
l can explain! Please listen to me! Char!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No, please. No! No!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There's been a huge mistake.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just listen. Please!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Edgar) You realize, of course,
she'll have to be put to death immediately.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l just don't understand.
Maybe l should go and talk to her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No. No, l forbid you to go down there.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your Highness,
your uncle didn't want to frighten you,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but the secret police informed us
of a possible uprising.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those ogres in the forest,
they were after you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The girl was obviously part of the scheme.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ogres never planned to hurt her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She was just toying
with your emotions, Char,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
so she could get close to you
and commit the murder herself.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l... l just don't believe it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Yes, it does seem quite fantastic.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You let me worry about all this, hm?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You just concentrate
on tomorrow's coronation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sire, you know l've been working
with the Red Guard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why not call them in now and take over
the whole kingdom like we planned?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First we must find a way
to get rid of the prince.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And l think l have
a pretty good idea how to do it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(cock crows)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All right. We just have to find a way
to get past those guards.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Benny) Help! Please,
somebody get me out of here!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Benny? What's he doing here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ugh!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Slannen, you've saved my life.
- Are you OK?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- l could kiss you.
- l think a nice thank-you note is enough.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l think Ella's in trouble.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Something to do with Edgar.
We have to find her.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Show me Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Edgar's done this?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We've gotta go in there and stop him.
lt'll take courage, bravery...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Elves scream)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l was gonna ask you
how you'd like to be eaten,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but if it's Edgar you're after... count us in.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Welcome aboard.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Executioner coming through.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Enter.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Help.
- l wouldn't do that if l were you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Open up. l'm Miss Frell's
legal representation.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Her what?
- Her lawyer, numbskull.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf the gauntlet doesn't fit,
you must acquit.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, open this door before l sue you
for everything you own.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, move it! Come on! Come on!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you. Slannen of Pim is not an elf
easily drawn into a legal battle,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
but when faced with a challenge
to equality, freedom and civil liberties,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
this elf will draw the sword of justice.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And, furthermore...
Excuse me, what is going on here?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Well, can we at least take him to go?
- Put the nice man down.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (Ella) Slannen?
- Ella?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Slannen!
- Oh, Ella!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Benny!
- Are you OK?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l'm fine, but Char might not be.
Show me Edgar.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- (Slannen) That's Char's crown.
- (Ella) He's poisoned it.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We gotta go. Come on. Come on, guys.
We got a coronation to crash.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(fanfare)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People of Lamia.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Today is a very special day
for our kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For today you are here to witness
the crowning of a king.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Bring in the crown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Drop that crown!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- ( Char) Ella?
- Seize them!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lt's payback time.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Charge!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Char!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kill them, and anyone
who gets in your way.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No! No, no, no, no!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l can't believe l'm saving you,
after you tried to kill me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l didn't try to kill you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You get away from her!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Take this!
- (Benny) Hey!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That dagger you were about to plunge into
my back was an early wedding present?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hello! Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mandy! Help!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Fairies in kingdoms across the land,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
please help me turn Benny
back into a man.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A pumpkin?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OK, maybe l did try to kill you,
but that wasn't me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- What?
- Maybe it was me, but it wasn't my fault.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then Edgar found out about the curse
and he ordered me to kill you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So l had to break up with you,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
even though l'm pretty sure that you're
the best thing that's ever happened to me.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That crown he's about to put
on your head, it's poisoned.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Duck.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Whoa.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Edgar's trying to kill me?
- Yes. Hold on.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How vulgar!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Excuse me. Thank you.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Char, there's one more thing.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He killed your father.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What? That can't be true.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, of course it's not true.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who are you gonna believe? This lying
little twit, or the man who raised you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(hisses)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He tried to kill Char!
- Get him!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, l guess that answers that question.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You vile little girl.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l should have disposed of you
when l had the chance.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You almost destroyed this kingdom.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You killed my father, your own brother.
How could you?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How could l?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l wanted something,
he was in my way, l got rid of him.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(muttering)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He wasn't fit to wear this crown,
and you're not fit to wear this crown.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This crown is mine.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This kingdom is...
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oops.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(all gasp)
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We won't be needing that.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You saved my life.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then we're even.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ella! Ella, stop kissing him!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You are never to kiss him again.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You wanna bet?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marry me?
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Now, that l'll do.
- (all) Ah!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
l now pronounce you husband and wife.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To a nation of equals.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To my good friends.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And to my true love, Ella.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So, such is the story of Ella of Frell,
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
a spunky young woman
once under a spell.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
lf there's one thing to learn,
it's you just can't go wrong
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
if you follow your heart
and end with a song.
