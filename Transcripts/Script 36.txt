<b>Fievel</b>: (voiceover) And then. the hero, Wylie Burp, squinted across the dusty street. Hopelessly surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang, he stood his ground, refusing to back down.
<span><b>Cactus Cat gang</b>: </span>[Laughing and cocking their guns]
<b>Fievel</b><span>: (hustles up to Wylie Burp) </span>Have no fear, Billy the Kid is here!
<b>Wylie Burp</b>: It's too tough, kid. Get out while you still can.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>If you're biting the dust, I'm going down with ya!
[Gunshots]
<span class=""><b>Cactus Cat gang</b>: </span>[Yelling]
<b>Wylie Burp</b>: You saved my life. I'll never forget this, kid. Here, son, I want you to have one of these. (gives Fievel his sheriff's badge until a lone cat raises his pistol at Fievel) Look out behind you, kid!
(Fievel fires his pistol at the cat.)
<b>Female</b>: (offscreen) FIEVEL! Your supper's ready! [Echoing] Ready, ready, ready. (The bullet changes into a popgun cork, ending Fievel's fantasy, as Fievel's cowboy outfit turns back into his casual clothes and hat and the town turns back into the front cover of a Wylie Burp comic book.)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Ouch!
<b>Mama</b>: Fievel! Fievel!
(The camera fades to the New York skyline and then pans down into the mice neighborhood.)
<b>Tanya</b>: (singing) Somewhere out there,
Beneath the pale moonlight,
Someone's thinking of me,
And loving me... [Splattering]
And loving me... [Splattering]
And loving me...
<b>Man</b>: Shut up!
<b>Tanya</b><span>: (worried) </span>Papa, they're throwing fruit and vegetables at me again.
<b>Papa</b>: Keep singing. Maybe they will throw some fruit for dessert.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>Another night without cheese.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Yee-haa! Howdy, Mama. I come to rustle me up some grub.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>Where have you been, Fievel? You're late.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I had to rescue Sheriff Wylie Burp. He was surrounded by the Cactus Cat gang.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>Oh, such a tall tale, Fievel. And dirty hands too? (clicks her tongue) Go wash.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, Mama, I just washed... yesterday.
<b>Papa</b><span>: </span>I thought things would be better in America. In Russia, my violins were famous. At least, we never went hungry.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">:</span><span class=""> </span>Maybe Tanya should sing again.
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">:</span><span class=""> </span>Very funny. You'll see. Someday I'll be a big star. People will come from miles around.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: (jokingly) </span>Yeah, to eat. Ha-ha!
<b>Mama</b><span class="">: (sternly) </span>Fievel...
(The entire Mousekewitz home shakes, caused by an elevated passenger train rumbling above the New York streets. The Mousekewitzes are affected by the shaking as Fievel falls on the floor and the candlelight goes out, darkening the house and the screen. After it dies down, Papa relights the candle's fuse.)
<b>Papa</b>: (depressed) They call America the land of opportunity. Opportunity for what? For children to play in the filthy streets? To never see the sunshine? Fievel's birthday is coming... and we don't have enough money for presents.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, Papa, I don't care.
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">: </span>I could sing in front of the gift shop. Maybe they'll throw presents. [Laughing]
<b>Papa</b><span>: (relieved) </span>How blessed I am to have such fine children. Maybe things will get better.
(They hear a crashing sound from outside, followed by a yelp from Tiger.)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Tiger? Tiger!
(Cut to: Tiger and Miss Kitty)
<b>Tiger</b>: Can we just have an espresso and talk this over?
<b>Miss Kitty</b>: Listen, Tiger. You're an alley cat.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Pretty please.
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>Born and bred.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>How true.
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>I got a ticket to sunshine and I'm going west. There's a town that promises a new frontier... and a brand-new breed of cat.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Is there anything wrong with my breed?
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>City cats got too much purr in their fur. Not enough growl in their howl. Look at you. You catnap, cat around. Heck, I don't mean to be mean, but you're even a bit of a fraidy cat.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Who told you that? I'm no fraidy cat. I'll show you. I'll show them. I'm no fraidy cat.
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: (serious) </span>Tiger. I don't want a tomcat, top cat or a tough tabby. I just want... How do I say this? I just want a cat who's more like a dog. [hears a team of horses neighing] That's my ride out West. Show me you're tough. Don't make a fuss, okay? (sprays perfume that takes the shape of a shapely female cat)
<b>Cat Perfume</b>: [Purring]
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>You don't mean... this is good-bye?
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>There are no good-byes between you and me. After all, we'll always have the Bronx. Here's looking at you, kid. (jumps onto the passing horse-drawn wagon down below and rides off for Grand Central Terminal)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>The Bronx, that's right. The Bronx, right. I won't make a fuss. I can handle it. I can... [Purring] I can, uh... I can, uh... [Breaks down into tears]
<b>Mouse 1</b>: <span>Cat attack!</span>
(The camera cuts to an old trombone sounding the alarm and being operated by three mice.)
<b>Mouse 2</b>: Cat attack!
(The camera cuts to the streets where the mice are feeling for their lives. One of them, holding a newspaper in his hands, looks at the sight of the Cactus Cat Gang. One-Eye, one of the members of the gang, leaps into action, the camera zooming in on his only eye, as he is followed by Frenchy and a 3rd member.)
<b>Mouse 3</b>: Cat attack!
<b>Female Mouse</b>: [Screaming]
<b>Cat R. Waul</b>: (looms into view with the 4th member of his gang) Pay attention. Keep it clean and tidy; plenty of violence, but no eating. Right. Carry on, chaps.
<b>Baby Mouse</b>: [Crying]
<b>Mama</b>: Fievel! Fievel! Get in here with the family!
<b>Cat Bandit 1</b>: (whooping)
<b>Cat Bandit 2: </b>Meow! (cackling)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh, no! The mice! Aw, gee!
[Cackling] Peekaboo! [Laughing]
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh, I got... I gotta do something. I will be tough. I will be brave. (screams when he sees Cat R. Waul's right-hand spider, T.R. Chula, drop in using his spider silk) It's a spy... a spee... a spide... de... de... de... (freaks out) an arachnid! (falls) Aaah! (lands in a trash can)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Why, those no-good ornery varmints! (gets ready to fight crime)
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Fievel, my son! Come back!
<b>Mama</b>: (gasps)
[Thunder rumbles as Fievel comes back for a brief second)
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, thank heavens.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I forgot my hat. (runs outside, stops and turns his cap inside out to become his cowboy hat, and runs into the danger ahead)
<b>One-Eye</b><span>: </span>[Wicked Laughter]
<b>Papa</b>: Fievel, come back!
<b>One-Eye</b>: Hee-ya!
<b>Papa</b>: Fievel! Fievel, my son, come back! (One-Eye thrusts his paw into the Mousekewitz household, obliviously bringing the Mousekewitzes outside.)
<b>Papa</b><span>: </span>[Yelling, clutching onto the edge of a wooden crate.]
(One-Eye drops Mama, Tanya and Yasha, inside their tuna box, onto the pavement as he starts digging inside the Mousekewitz household, snickering.)
<b>Tanya</b>: Papa!
(Papa struggles to climb onto the edge.)
<b>One-Eye</b>: (notices Mama, Tanya, and Yasha) Huh?
<b>Mama &amp; Tanya</b>: [Gasping]
(One-Eye<b> </b><span>chuckles wickedly and closes in on the girls, until he hears Fievel's voice.)</span>
<b>Fievel</b>: I see you're missing an eye, pilgrim. Now, this makes it a fair fight.
<b>One-Eye</b><span class="">: (growling) </span>Yeah?
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>That's right. I'm talking to you, fur head.
<b>One-Eye</b><span class="">: </span>[Growling] Fur head?
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>[Gasping]
<b>One-Eye</b><span class="">: </span>I don't care what the boss says. This mouse is lunch. Heh-heh-heh-heh!
<b>Mama</b>: Run! Run, Fievel!
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, no.
(One-Eye closes in on the cowering Fievel with the camera focusing on both pairs of eyes, until One-Eye's single eye becomes stimulated by the noise of a screeching violin. One-Eye covers his ears to block out the sound, as Fievel looks up to see Papa playing his violin therefore distracting the enemy.)
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: (to Fievel) </span>For your life, Fievel, run!
(Fievel runs off and gets in an empty can. He runs on its inner surface to get it moving and maneuvers it alongside Mama, Tanya, and Yasha.)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Mama, Tanya, get in!
(The girls jump aboard.)
<b>Mama</b>: Fievel!
<span>(Papa is the last to catch up, running a distance of discarded crates.)</span>
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Papa, get in!
(Papa jumps in, assisted by Mama and Tanya. One-Eye makes a leap for the can but misses, propelling the Mousekewitzes in the can to a sewer grate. It is not long until One-Eye charges forward to the Mousekewitzes like a tiger!)
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Everybody, together, run! (They all start running, pressing their feet on the can's surface.) Run! (One-Eye makes one last attempt to catch the Mousekewitzes, until the family uses its strength to roll inside the sewer. One-Eye looks on with disappointment until Cat R. Waul arrives.)
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Jolly, jolly good. Now for my part.
(Fade out. The camera then fades in on the city sewers where the Mousekewitzes are drifting in the can down the pipeline.)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Look!
(A large waterfall lies ahead of them. The Mousekewitzes ride down the waterfall and pass through a series of rapids, screaming in terror, minus Fievel screaming with excitement. They go down one last waterfall, much larger than the first one. They fall down into the water below, screaming until they hit the water with a great splash. The camera blacks out with the splash and then fades in on the exhausted Mousekewitz family.)
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: (in a high-pitched voice) </span>Let's go on that ride again!
<b>Mama</b><span>: (exasperated) </span>Where did I get such a son?
<b>Cowboy Mouse</b>: Why, howdy, fine mice. I'm in desperate need of help. I've come into possession of railway tickets to the West. Tickets to sunshine that I will be unable to use. Surely there are some of y'all... looking for a little elbow room, y'all. Now, I ain't gonna lie. There are problems out West. There's a lot of bright sunshine and fresh air. But after these opulent, aromatic sewers, that might be... upsetting for you all, you all, y'all, sorry.
<b>Mouse 1</b>: I'll take one.
<b>Italian Mouse Father</b>: I'll take 15.
<b>Cowboy Mouse</b><span>: </span>Hold your horses one minute, y'all. There's plenty for everyone, yes, sirree.
<b>Female Mouse</b>: Are there any cats out West?
<b>Cowboy Mouse</b>: There certainly are. If you have prejudices... against cats you better stay put. On the frontier, cats and mice help each other. <span>(The camera pans up to see Cat R. Waul working his marionette of the Cowboy Mouse.)</span>
<b>Cat R. Waul</b>: (as the Cowboy Mouse) The anointed leader of cats, Mr. Cat R. Waul,is the most enlightened, intelligent, sophisticated, charming, non-narcissistic, debonair, suave, dashing, renaissance cats you could... ever wish to meet. Uh, ah, the fact is, cats even get along with the dogs out there. Sheriff Wylie Burp is probably the finest... law-dog in the West, actually, y'all.
<b>Fievel</b><span>: </span>Wylie Burp, wow!
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Too bad there aren't any desperadoes left to round up. Hee-hee-hee!
<b>Mouse 2</b>: I'll take a ticket.
-
<b>Mouse 3</b>: Three tickets, please.
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Don't push, please. Plenty for all. Three tickets.
- Three for you, jolly good.
<b>Fievel</b>: Come on, Papa. Let's go!
<b>Mama</b>: There is opportunity out West.
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">: </span>Maybe they have a better appreciation of singers out there.
<b>Papa</b>: So what are we fiddling around here for? Let's go west, partners!
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Jolly, jolly good. Anybody still like some tickets, y'all? <span>[Meowing] </span>
(Fade out)
<span>(The camera fades in on the abandoned mouse neighborhood and pans right to the trash can where Tiger fell into last evening.) </span>
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>[groaning, getting out of the trash can] Oh, those nine lives come in handy. Fiev? Fievel? Hello? (sees the empty Mousekewitz household) Wow, it's empty. (sees a letter) Oh, no. What's this? Oh, no! ( grabs the house and then reads the letter) "Dear Tiger, We left New York. We're taking the train to a town out West called Green River. I tried to find you to tell you, but I guess you were somewhere with Miss Kitty. "I miss you and I hope I see you again sometime. Your best friend, Fievel." (His left eye tears up after he reads the note.) Train, the train! They're taking the train.
(He breaks his head out of the box by smashing the box against a wall, and he then hustles his way for Grand Central Terminal. Black out.)
(Fade in: Grand Central Terminal, interior)
<b>Papa</b>: Hurry, Mama. The train won't wait.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>I'm sure we forgot something. Let us see. We have your violin tools, the pots and pans-I took them anyhow. Your pipe, the tail curler, whisker comb, the cheese ball, and Grandpa's cheese knife. I hope we have everything.
<b>Papa</b><span>: </span>Don't worry. It will be wonderful.
[Train Whistle]
<b>Female Mouse Actress</b>: Alas, poor Yorick. I knew him well.
<b>Opera Mouse</b>: [Singing]
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">: </span>Look, Mama, an actor... and a singer!
<b>Mama</b><span class="">: </span>Tanya, stop that. You shouldn't stare at people less fortunate than yourself.
<b>Mouse Conductor</b>: Last call, all passengers bound for Altoona, Akron, Elkhart, Oskaloosa and Green River.
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Fievel, what is wrong with you? You should be happy we are going west.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">:</span>I was hoping Tiger would come say good-bye. Will I ever see him again, Papa?
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Who am I to know, Fievel? Tiger was a wonderful cat, but he was still a cat. Someday you will understand.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>When, Papa? When will I understand?
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>If growing up were easy, would it take so long?
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Bye, Tiger, wherever you are. You're the best cat I ever met. (sniffles)
<b>Tiger</b>: (in the distance) I gotta catch up with that train!
(Cut to: The NYC rooftops)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: Oh, </span>Fievel, wait for me! Wait for me, please!
<b>Dog</b>: [Barking]
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh, dogs. I hate those guys!
(Tiger is continued being chased by the dog, until Tiger falls off the building into a pile of trash. He runs out of the pile, with a teapot in his hands, until he starts walking on a pack of street dogs. He stammers nervously and then panics, waking the entire dog pack. The dogs snap their jaws at Tiger, but he is able to climb the side of another building, then slides down a layer of roof tiles, and is able to hold onto a flagpole. He sees Fievel's train getting ready to leave the station.)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh, good! Fievel's train hasn't left yet.
(Just then, he hears a pug growling at him.)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: (whining) </span>I want my mommy. Uh-oh. [Yelling]
(The pug breaks one end of the pole, sending Tiger falling and screaming into a dog pound. He tries to inflate himself by sucking in some air, which results in himself bouncing on the dog cage doors like a pinball. When Tiger stops, the doors open and the dogs growl at Tiger.)
<b>Tiger</b>: Now, listen, you guys, be nice. Be nice.
(Tiger then runs for his life away from the dog pound with the dogs close on his heels.)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh!
(<span>He jumps inside to get away from them, and once the coast is clear, Tiger leaps down grabbing a cane and straw hat, doing a small victory dance and laughing.</span>
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Ah-ha-ha! Oops.
(The dogs return to chase Tiger, who then chases after his friend's train. The leading doberman growls behind him.)
<b>Tiger</b><span>: (grabs the doberman's tongue) </span>Cat got your tongue? (reaching the caboose) Wait! That's definitely... That's my train! I want it. Ah-ha-ha! (The dogs catch up with Tiger, as the doberman bites his tail.) Please, I'll be good. I'll always lick. I'll always cover my... [Stammering]
(The doberman tugs on Tiger's tail so hard, that part of the fur is torn off, catapulting Tiger onto the caboose platform.)
<b>Tiger</b>: (excited) A-ha! I made it! What a stupid dog! Na-na-na-na-na-na! Your mother was never housebroken! Ha-ha-ha! Toodle-oo! (goes into the caboose and meets an angry conductor bulldog) Hello. [Yelling]
(He breaks out of the caboose and gets hit by a speeding freight train. His face is pushed back by the wind, ti which Tiger climbs away from the smokebox door and winds up in the cab window, seeing a mutt at the controls.)
<b>Tiger</b>: Oh, no, not again!
(The mutt leaps up and barks at Tiger, who falls into the Hudson River and meets a literal dogfish who barks and growls at him.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Dogfish.
(Fade out)
(The camera cuts to the locomotive passing over the camera.)
<b>Train</b>: Way out West, way out West,
way out West, way out West.
Way out West, way out West.
<b>Fievel</b>: Are we out West yet?
<b>Mama</b><span class="">: </span>West Jersey, maybe.
<b>Opera Mouse</b>: Life in New York City,
is full of dread and fuss!
Our dreams are waiting west,
there's room for all of us!
<span><b>Prospector Mouse</b>:</span> Oh, the streets are paved nuggets,
all of purest gold!
And soon, we'll all be millionaires...
<b>Bank Clerk</b>: Boy, have I been told!
[Train Whistle]
<b>Fat Mouse</b>: No garbage and no landlords,
foulin' up the air,
<b>Female</b> <b>Mouse</b>: No crooks or politicians,
to strip our cupboards bare!
<b>Smart Mouse</b>:  We'll ride the roaring rivers,
Turn wilderness to towns.
Our dreams will take us up,
and never let us down.
<b>All</b>: Way out West,

There's wide open spaces to see!
(Train Whistle)
<b>All</b>: Way out West,

We'll be everything we can be!
<b>Italian Mouse Father</b><span>: </span>The nights are filled with dancing,

Work is just like playing!
<b>Mouse 1</b>: We'll banjo!
<b>Mouse 2:</b> We'll fiddle!
<b>Mouse 3</b>: We'll guitar!
<b>Mouse 4</b>: We'll spoon!
 <b>All</b>: Everywhere we go out there,
we'll play this rousing tune.
'Cause way out West,
we'll build a new nation.
We'll grow all the way to the sky...
Way out West,

<b>Catfish</b>: [Meowing]
<b>Ship</b> <b>Captain</b>: Eh, shut up!
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>[Screaming ] My mother always wanted me to be on the stage. Excuse me, sir, Mr. Cowboy. Uh, you wouldn't be going to Green River, would you?
<b>Dog</b>: [Growling]

[Train Whistle]

<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I know you.
You sold us the tickets.
Hi, my name is Fievel Mousekewitz.
[Gasping]
<b>Chula</b>: Heh-heh-heh-heh!
I win again, fathead.
<b>One-Eye</b>: I say you cheatin'.
You plays your last hand, Chula.
<span><b>Chula</b>: </span>I don't think so.
I got seven more, dog chow.
<b>Cat</b>: Why, you dirty, rotten,
low-down, double dealing...
<span><b>One-Eye</b>: </span>I don't get it, boss. How come
we're not munching those mice?
<b>Frenchy</b>: Oui. "Zees" fraternity "wiz" mice
does run counter to nature.
<span><b>Cat R. Waul</b>: </span>Which would you rather have: The crouton or the entire caesar salad? Of course, we will eat the mice, but only after we have exploited their labors. We are nice to the mice... because it is intelligent to be so. If we talk sweetly, they will come in droves. If we hiss, they will run and we will have to chase them, an unnecessary expenditure of calories.
<span class=""><b>One-Eye</b>: </span>So when do we take the big bite, boss?
<span class=""><b>Chula</b>:<b> </b></span>When do we get to eat them? When, when, when?
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>When my empire at Green River is complete... and when we have a better mousetrap.
<b>All</b>: Mouseburgers!
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Yes, mouseburgers indeed. Music... to aid the digestion.
<b>Mouse Conductor</b>:<b> </b>Help!
[Humming]
[Violin]
<b>Mouse Conductor</b><span>: </span>Next stop: Mouth, throat, stomach, intestine and, you guessed it, Green River. Whoa, oh! <span>Whoa, whoa, oh!</span>
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">:</span> Uh-oh.
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>What do we have here? It appears to be a young pioneer. Now, the feline in me would like to devour this tender morsel, but the shrewd businessman in me knows if I do, the other mice will miss him and come looking. But the gourmet in me quivers at the thought... of mouse tartar. But, the entrepreneur prefers not to be inundated... by suspicious mice that could jeopardize my plan. So I must exercise... both willpower and finesse. Scamper back to your parents, little mouse. Do be careful. It's frightfully hazardous out there.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Bye.
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span class="">: </span>Give him the Flying "Ahh", and make it good.
<span class=""><b>Chula</b>: The Flying "Ahh"! </span>I love the flying "ahh"! [Wicked Laughing] Mouse overboard!
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Where? What?
<span class=""><b>Chula</b>: </span>I just love the flying "ahh."
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Ahh!
<b>Papa</b>: Fievel! Fievel, my son.
<b>Mouse</b>: Don't be a fool, Mousekewitz!
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>[Groaning]
<b>Tiger</b>: Excuse me. You got a minute?
Are there any
rest stops on this trip?
Hey, wait for me.
You can't leave me here.
I burn easily.
I'm...
lost, all alone in
a million-acre cat box.
Phooey!
[Train Whistle]
<b>Mama</b>: My son, Fievel. [Sniffling] [Moaning] You know something?
I think we got snookered.
<b>Papa</b><span>: </span>No, Mama, this is what the land of opportunity looks like... I think.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>It feels empty and lonely.
Over here,
over here.
Hey, you,
this is my place.
This is my place.
Wanna buy it?
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>Papa, quick.
<b>Papa</b><span class="">:</span> All right, we may be slower,
but we are smarter.
All these speedy mices
are fighting over the land.
In this dusty country you
want to be near the water.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>So this is what we
left New York for.
This is what we
lost Fievel for.
<span class=""><b>Chula</b>: </span>Chula, do this.
Chula, do that.
I'm a good-looking
spider, no?
There's lots of women
like to marry me.
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Mama, Fievel will come.
He's a Mousekewitz.
If we work hard, Green River
will be everything we dreamed.
The water, for instance.
In days it will be
a beautiful waterfall.
That patch of mud will be
a rich field covered with grain.
Prairie dogs will graze on that land,
and the city will prosper.
The water.
<b>Mama</b><span>: </span>Without water...
how can we survive?
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Please, please, there's no need for such a
bleak assessment of your situation.
After all,
what are neighbors for?
A cup of sugar,
a saucer of cream.
A pail of water,
perhaps.
<span class=""><b>Chula</b>: </span>Water? I'll give 'em water.
[Spitting]
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>I'd like to share
a vision.
A vision of a better world.
<b>Mouse</b>: My eyes!
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>A world where cats and mice
live and work side by side.
A world where mothers raise
their mouselings without fear.
Where musicians receive
their proper due.
Where young mousettes
fulfill their every, dream.
Will you help me build this world?

Oh, my darling,

<b>[Female]</b> Who?
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Oh, my darling...
Oh, my darling?

<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>:  </span>Who?
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>It's me, Tiger. Your darling baby buppie-bunga-boo. Hey, you're not my darling. I just kissed an owl.
[Fievel Echoing]
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Tiger!

<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Hi, mirage of Tiger.
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Hi, mirage of Fievel. Don't they ever dust this place? Boy, (coughs) a guy could make a fortune selling... (a buffalo skeleton rattles its bones) vacuum cleaners. Dancing buffalo bones... Naw.
[War Cries]
[Chanting]
<b>Tiger</b><span>: Aw, c</span>ome on, fellas. I'm just a mangy, old cat. I don't taste good without, you know, ketchup.
<b>Female Mousehican</b>: Ummm.
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>No. No, no, no, ma'am. I'm not your color. Could we have an espresso and talk this over, please?
(Geronimouse, leader of the Mousehican tribe, shuffles from his tent to the fire and stops, catching his tribe's attention.
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>How... do you do? (chuckles)
<b>Geronimouse</b>: [Speaking In Mousehican Dialect] Huh? (notices Tiger's shape resembling that of the butte beyond the campground.) Ah. (steps closer to Tiger)
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>(chuckles nervously)

[Screeching]
[Groaning]
[Hawk Screeching]
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Mama! [Echoing] Papa!
[Chanting]
[Laughing] They think I'm their Tiger god. How lucky can you get? I mean, how did they know I was a vegetarian? Mm-mm-mm. [Burping] It's funny how your appetite perks up when you find out...that you're gonna eat dinner instead of be dinner. Innkeeper, more wine.
[War Cries]
[Mousehican Dialect]
Shhh!
<b>Fievel</b>: I said put me down, you ugly furball! I won't stand for this! Put me down!
[Clucking]
Uh-oh.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Help! Water!
Oh, no, I'm in a mouth. [Screams] [Coughing, Gulping]
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>A little endive
went down the wrong tube.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I hope he doesn't throw up. (braces against Tiger's breath) Get me out of here!
<b>Tiger</b><span>: </span>Who said that?
<b>Fievel</b>: (inside Tiger) Me.
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Me, he says.
-
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Say "ah"!
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Ah.
-
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Tiger!
-
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Fievel!
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I thought I'd never see you.
We waited for you at the station.
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Believe me,
I tried to get there,
but I was dogged
every step of the way.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, Tiger,
you're my best friend.
C'mon on, let's go
to Green River.
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>There's something
I forgot to mention.
The only reason I'm not
a moccasin right now...
is because they think
I'm a god.
This conversation is making
me look very ungodlike.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Tiger, listen.
I have to warn my family.
The cats are gonna turn
them into mouse...
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>shh!
These folks get offended
if you eat and run.
I'll join you as soon as I can.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>You promise?
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to cry.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, Tiger. I almost forgot. How do you get to Green River?
(A sagebrush brakes to a stop out of nowhere.)
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: Just g</span>rab a passing sagecoach.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: (climbs into the sagebrush) </span>See you later, Tiger! Adios. (rides away in the sagebrush)
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Sagecoach, get it? Sage. (laughs) Oh, never mind.

he's alive.

Mousekewitz, don't let go!
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, Fievel. What happened to you?
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I got lost in this desert. This giant hawk picked me up and dropped me.. right on the Mousehican village where Tiger is a god. Papa, I have to warn you. The cats, they're gonna build this giant mousetrap. They're gonna turn us into mouseburgers!
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>A giant mousetrap
and Tiger is a god?
Fievel's been out in the sun too long.
Mousekewitz!
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>But Tiger is a god and they
are building a giant mousetrap.
<b>Papa</b><span class="">: </span>Fievel, the only thing

You will see that out West

<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: Cat R. Waul, </span>I heard what you said about mouseburgers. I'm gonna tell everyone. I'm gonna get Wylie Burp, 'cause he's the law!
<b>Cat R. Waul</b><span>: </span>Wylie Burp? [Laughing] That quaint, historical figure. Put simply, I am the law here. You're a mere hors d'oeuvre.

and mean like you were acting?
<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>Who, me?
Naw.
I'm soft as this powder puff

But living out here around

What's your name,

a great singer.

<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>Sweetie, you wouldn't
be an artiste...
if you weren't
nervous.
<b>Tanya</b><span class="">: </span>I'm not pretty.

You can be whatever you want
if you believe in yourself.
Show me some grit and guts.
Come on, honey.
Give me a smile.
Oh, no, no.
Sweetheart, you can
do better than that.
Think of something
real nice.
I want you to reach
deep down...
and find the most beautiful

Oh, beautiful.

<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>Tonight, Tanya,

You're with your fella
at the El Purrocco club.
You're on that stage,
and he has a front row seat.
You're singing your heart out
just for him.
There are things there
I miss so much.

I've forgotten why I left.
So much for regrets.
- So, do you like yourself?

Doggone it, I'm dog tired. I'm
tired of leadin' a dog's life...
and fighting like cats and dogs

I'm goin' to the dogs
in a dog-eat-dog world, son.

But you know,
I think I might
be able to help ya.
How? We've only got
'til sundown tomorrow.
Gotta find me a dog.
I'll teach him the stuff.
I'll make a hero
out of him.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I don't know

a god!
<b>Tiger</b><span class="">: </span>Oh, no, I can't.
You got the wrong cat.

You want me to dribble all over it?
<b>Wylie</b><span class="">: </span>You wanna act like a dog,

'til you smell
like a dog.
No self-respecting dog
fetches anything,
unless he's good
and feels like it.
You wanna intimidate someone,
give 'em the la-a-zy eye.

Okay, what's the la-a-zy eye?

<b>Miss Kitty</b><span>: </span>Tiger! Oh, Tiger.
<b>Wylie</b><span class="">: </span>I never taught him that one.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>[Gasps] Wylie.
[Howling]
<b>Wylie</b><span class="">: </span>Here, son. I want you to have one of these.
<b>Fievel</b><span class="">: </span>I can't. I'm not a hero like you... well, not really.
<b>Wylie</b><span class="">: </span>Well, maybe not.
Maybe a real hero's the
last one to hear about it.
But you pulled me out
of a gutter...
and for that
I owe you some thanks.
Just remember, Fievel,
one man's sunset is
another man's dawn.
I don't know
what's out there...
beyond those hills,
but if you ride yonder,
head up, eyes steady,
heart open,
I think one day
you'll find...
that you're the hero
you've been lookin'for.
#I lose my way #
#No one cares #
#
The words I say #
#No one hears #
#My life it seems #
#Is a world of dreams #
#Deep in the night #
# You'll find me #
#
Dream, and you're right #
#Behind me #
#Stay #
#If you will stay #
#
 We'll dream
the night away #
#
Dreams to dream #
#In the dark of the night #
#
 When the world
goes wrong #
#I can still
make it right #
#
I can see so far
in my dreams #
#I'll follow my dreams #
#
 Until they come true #
#
 There is a star #
#
 Waiting to guide us #
#Shining inside us #
#
 When we close our eyes #
#
 Come with me #
#
 You will see
what I mean #
#
There's a world inside #
#
No one else ever sees #
#
You will go so far #
#In my dreams #
#Somewhere in my dreams #
#
 Your dreams will come true #
#
Don't let go #
#
If you stay close to me #
#
In my dreams tonight #
#
 You will see
what I see #
#
Dreams to dream #
#
As near as can be #
#Inside you and me #
#
 They always come #
# True #
#
Inside you and me #
# T
hey always come #
# True #
