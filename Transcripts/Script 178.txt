[Instrumental. A snowy sky. Night. The opening titles play shortly and the screen pans
down to the town of Dukesberry, where a factory and a bridge are seen. Shots of the town
are shown as the narrator speak
s (voiced by Rob Schnieder)]
Narrator:
{Shot of a neighborhood}
Well, all right. Look at all that beautiful, white stuff
come down.
{Shot of giant ice menorah and Santa sculptures being worked on behind the
banquet hall}
Christmas is right around the corn
er and Chanukah starts tonight.
{Shot of
someone lighting a menorah on the first candle}
Ain’t a better time of year. You got no
school, you can eat like a pig,
{shot of two people driving happily in a car, up to the
necks in presents}
and people give you
stuff. Just makes you feel tingly all over.
(laughs)
{Shot of the town church}
But you know what? There are some buffoons out there who
actually can’t stand the holiday season.
{Shots of a fire station and a nativity scene}
And
seeing other people enjoy th
e festivities gets them even more disgusted.
{Shot of
Dukesberry’s entrance}
As a matter of fact, the head honcho of holiday humbug lives
right here in little old Dukesberry.
{Shot of the China Dragon}
lives right here in little old
Dukesberry. His name’s
Davey Stone. And that fool is sittin’ in the China Dragon
coming up with his own way of feeling tingly all over.
[Inside the China Dragon. Davey Stone is sitting in a booth, slurping up another
Scorpion bowl. The China Dragon Waiter comes over to hand Da
vey the bill]
Davey: Hmm?
China Dragon Waiter: Four scorpion bowl in five minute? That’s got to be a restaurant
record.
Davey:
(drunk)
Well, right now I’m going to go for another restaurant record: longest
burp.
[Davey burps a huge burp, breaking the
glasses on a group across the restaurant, even
disgusting a homeless man outside]
China Dragon Waiter: Congratulations. Now, please excuse me while I go take shower.
[Davey looks at the bill as a kid from the booth next to his peers]
Narrator: At one t
ime, Davey was a super student, super athlete
{Davey rips the bill up
and heads out}
super sweet, super kid and the apple of his parents’ eye.
[Outside. Night. Davey bumps into a woman]
Narrator: Now, he’s just a 33
-
year
-
old crazy Jewish guy
{Davey he
ads drunkenly towards
his car, making another car almost swerve}
who lives for making this town as miserable
as he is
{Two policemen look at Davey, and then look at each other}
especially on the
first night of Chanukah.
{The policemen drive off}
How’d he e
nd up this way? Let’s save
that for later
{Davey grabs his keys and tries to insert them into his car}
because right
now, Davey’s about to get himself into some serious trouble.
[Davey’s car door lock is seen, with key marks all around it, signifying that
he’s done
this thing before. He tries to put the key in, but he’s too drunk to balance himself right to
do it. The two policemen drive up behind Davey]
Policeman #1: Hope you’re not planning on driving tonight, Stone.
Davey: Oh, no officer. I’m just goi
ng to say good night to my car then walk home and
enjoy the holiday decorations.
(to his car)
Listen, sweetheart.
(pats the car)
I have to
leave you here alone tonight, but don’t you worry, I’ll be back first thing in the morning.
Now behave yourself, and
don’t stay up too late. Heh. Nighty
-
night.
(he walks off, and
turns off the car, which beeps, in which makes him look back at the car)
All right, baby,
but let’s make this quick.
{The policemen look at Davey strangely}
Oh, mama!
(lies face
down on the back
of the car)
You like it when I hold you like this?
(rubs against the car)
Because I’ll do it all night long.
(licks the car)
Soooo sweet.
(licks the car again)
Yes, so
precious.
(slaps and bangs on the car’s rear)
Ooh
-
hoo
-
hoo
-
hoo! I love you car!
[Police
man #1 is disgusted by this, while Policeman #2 has tears in his eyes. Suddenly,
CDW (China Dragon Waiter) is yelling and standing in front the China Dragon, catching
the police’s attention]
CDW: He dine and dash me! He chew and screw me! He sip and skip
me!
Policeman #1: What?
CDW: He no pay for his four scorpion bowl!
Davey: Oh, boy.
[Tecnho rock music begins as the police start to chase Davey, who runs off]
Policeman #2: Get him!
[Davey runs off to an alley, where a man is putting away his trash. D
avey steals the lid
and begins to ride it]
Davey: Whee
-
hee
-
hee
-
hee!
Man #1: Come back here, you jerk!
[The music changes into that of “Davey’s Song”, the first musical number. Davey whisks
across a street, and two police cars slide next to each other tr
ying to capture him]
Policeman #2: Somebody stop that guy!
Davey:
I’m a kinda guy who can’t stand a holiday
(grabs a light strand and swings from it)
So I drink ‘em all away, that’s me
(ties the strand around people carrying a tree)
I don’t decorate no
trees
And I won’t eat no potato latkes
(knocks a bowl of latkes out of a man’s hands)
But I’ll give this old lady’s melons a squeeze
(squeezes a lady’s melons she’s carrying)
Old Lady: Hey!
Davey:
That’s just who I am
Well, I’ll never spin a dreidel,
but I’ll always throw an egg
(ruins a dreidel game)
And I’ll charley horse your leg for laughs
(hits a guy with an egg and hits the man’s leg)
While you’re singing your holiday tunes
(approaches some carolers)
I’m acting like the town buffoon
Whippin’ o
ut my big, white, scary moon
(moons the carolers)
Carolers: Aaah!
Davey:
And blowin’ a beef your way
(lets out a huge fart on the carolers)
I hate folks who think reindeer are cute
To me they’re just something to shoot
(shoots some deer with snowballs)
I hate love, I hate you, I hate me
Well, I’m a snowmobile stealing
(slides into a garage and steals a snowmobile)
‘No “’tis
-
the
-
season
-
feelin’” kind of guy (kind of guy)
(speeds from the police)
This time of year sucks
So I take my numchucks
And make sure
every snowman di
-
i
-
ies!
(knocks down all the snowmen)
Believin’ in Santa’s all wrong
(rips off the beard off a Santa)
Santa Impersonator: Ho!
Davey:
And Chanukah’s eight nights too long
(rams into the giant ice Santa, crushing into the
menorah, ruinin
g both statues)
I hate love, I hate you, I hate me
Policeman #1: Coming through.
Davey:
I hate love, I hate you, I hate me
[The police arrive and arrest Davey. Out of the crowd mad at Davey, Jennifer and
Benjamin scowl at him, two characters who are int
roduced later on]
Policeman #2: Davey Stone, you’re nothing but a delinquent!
[Outside the courthouse. Day. The judge pounds his gavel]
Judge: Stone, what the heck are we going to do with you?
[Inside the courthouse. Davey’s trial is going on]
Judge:
In the past twenty years, I’ve sent you to reform school, the drunk tank, the local
psychiatric ward. Not one of those places has made you change an ounce for the better.
‘Cause you used to be a good kid, playing ball for the Jewish Community Center, with
the best jump shot this town’s ever seen.
Davey:
(opening a flask)
Your honor, I still got a pretty good jump shot. Let me show
you.
(he takes a drink of whiskey, and then jumps very quickly, and not very far) {the
people viewing just shake their heads}
I
’d hit a three
-
pointer, except I’d have to drop my
pants and pop a thumb up my boo
-
boo.
[The people viewing show their disgust]
Judge: Stone, you leave me no choice. I’m gonna really have to crack down hard this
time.
Whitey:
(chiming in, with his fore
head seen a little in the seating area)
Your honor, if it
pleases the court, I’d like to interject for a moment.
CDW: What the hell was that? Did anybody else hear a parakeet, or am I going crazy?
[The people all laugh while Whitey shows himself by step
ping out into the aisle]
Whitey: No, Mr. Chang.
{NOTE: I’ll still refer him as the China Dragon Waiter since
that’s what the credits say}
It’s me, Whitey Duvall. And a happy first night of Chanukah
to you.
CDW: I’m not Jewish.
Whitey: Neither am I, but
that don’t stop me from enjoying a holiday.
(giggles)
Judge:
(exasperated)
Whitey, we went over this two months ago. It’s your last year of
reffing the youth league basketball. You’re turning 70 years old and our insurance
company says they won’t cover yo
u anymore.
Whitey: Ha, ha. No, no, no. My interjection pertains to the case currently under
adjudication. You see, I knew this young man years ago when his moral fiber was still
intact.
Judge: Whitey, what are you getting at?
Whitey: Why not sentence h
im to be a referee
-
in
-
training for the youth league basketball?
I’ve seen some pretty rowdy kids turn into perfect gentlemen after spending time on my
court.
Judge: If that happened with Stone, it would be a miracle.
Whitey: Well, it is the holidays and
those kinda things have been known to happen this
time of year.
[The crowd whispers]
Judge: Whitey, if you want to work with this punk, then God bless you. But Mr. Stone,
what Whitey says goes. And if I hear that you break one law, I will send you to the
state
penitentiary for no less than 10 years.
Davey: Huh?
Judge: Happy holidays.
[The judge pounds his gavel, adjourning the trial. Whitey looks promising at Davey]
Davey: Oh, God.
[Outside the Jewish Community Center. Night. Cars arrive to watch the
youth league
basketball game]
Narrator: The short man who’s kind and the donkey’s behind. What a bizarre matchup.
Good luck, Whitey. You’re gonna need it.
[The locker room. Whitey puts on his referee uniform]
Whitey: Ooh
-
hoo
-
hoo
-
hoo. Okay, let’s give t
he little guy some support.
[Davey comes over to see a disgusting sight: Whitey’s butt cheeks are covered with
white, furry hair as Whitey puts a jock strap on]
Davey: Ugh! Jeezum crow! Did I just see two Persian cats on your ass? I think I’m gonna
(burp
ing)
barf.
Whitey: Your horn works, try the lights.
(giggles)
Davey: Okay.
Whitey:
(stretching)
One. Two.
Davey: Good to see you still got those circus feet.
Whitey: Men’s 11 right foot, children’s 9 left foot.
(does a jig)
At your service.
Davey:
(slurring)
Yuck.
Whitey: Now, I assume you’ve done your pre
-
game stretching.
Davey: No, let me do it right now.
(puts both hands up to Whitey in a fist, and flips his
middle finger on both)
One. Two. Three.
{Shot of Whitey, nodding}
Four. Five. Six.
Wh
itey: Okay. That’s good, but don’t forget your hammies.
[The basketball court. The game is just about to begin]
Narrator: Of course Whitey wouldn’t understand what getting flipped off means.
{Whitey
walks out onto the floor}
He’s so behind the times, he
thinks Viagra’s a big waterfall.
(laughs) {A basketball goes under the 35
th
Annual All
-
Star Patch voting box. Whitey
picks it up and sees his reflection through the sign}
But there is one thing he knows. The
voting has begun for the highest honor anyone i
n town could receive.
Whitey: I think it’s gonna be your year, Whitey, I really do.
(sees Davey walking out)
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don’t even think of coming on this floor with those hard soles, pally.
Davey: Fine, I’ll just ref in my socks.
(knocks his sho
es into the air, the first one knocking
a hanging light out, the second one knocking one of the judge’s head into the buzzer
button, sounding the buzzer)
Must be game time.
Whitey: Don’t let him push your buttons, Whitey.
[Whitey blows his whistle, start
ing the game]
[A little later. The basketball game is well into. Davey watches as the team runs to one
side of the court, Whitey panting and trying to catch up. A shot is missed. The team runs
to the other side, Whitey panting and trying to catch up again
. Another shot is missed.
Same thing happens yet again. Another shot missed, as one kid passes it to a fat kid]
Kid #1: What are you waiting for?
Kid #2: Come on. Dribble! Hurry up!
[The fat kid tries to run and dribble, but trips over. Whitey rushes to
Davey]
Whitey: What, no whistle on that one, ref?
Davey: Okay.
(he blows the whistle and goes over to the fat kid)
Foul on this kid for
eating everything in sight.
Fat Kid: Huh?
Davey: Jelly jugs, next time you come on my court, you better wear a bra.
Okay?
[The fat kid cries while Whitey tries to comfort him]
Whitey: He was just kidding, son. You’ve got very nice boobs.
[The fat kid just runs off crying more]
Person #1: Jerk!
Person #2: Idiot!
Audience: Boo!
Davey:
(to basketball audience)
Oh,
you don’t like that? How about you throw something
at me. I dare you.
Person #3: With pleasure!
[The crowd throws items on the court, making the floor dirty]
Whitey: They’re scratching up my floor. Here comes a seizure. (
falls on the floor and
begins ha
ving a seizure)
This will pass in a second, kids. Don’t be scared.
Kid #3: Is he break dancing?
Davey:
(blows his whistle)
Okay, that’s it. Game over. Nobody wants to see an old man
die. Fatty’s team loses because I want to see him cry again.
[The fat k
id, now in his parents’ arms, continues to bawl]
Whitey: I want to talk to you in my office.
[By office, Whitey means the Dukesberry Mall. Night. Whitey and Davey enter the mall,
filled with Christmas decorations]
Davey: Why the hell are we at the mall?
Whitey: ‘Cause you need to clean your brain out, pal. And to me, the mall is the best
place to do that.
Davey: So, what’s good about this place?
Whitey: What’s good about it? Everything. You want a pair of socks?
(pointing)
My
buddy, Mr. Foot Locker wi
ll warm your feet. You need a fancy doodad? Hello, Sharper
Image. Thanks for the combination pogo stick/clock radio. I mean, The Body Shop, the
Tie Rack, GNC, Radio Shack, Petland for a cat or two, Spencer’s Gifts for some fake dog
doo, Sbarro’s, Dunkin’ D
onuts, they’re simply the best. And don’t forget the orange
chicken at Panda Express.
(at See’s Candies)
But if you’re short of cash like little old me,
the window shopping’s always free.
Davey: Is that something you prepared or did you rhyme that many ti
mes in a row by
accident?
Whitey: Yeah, that was weird, wasn’t it?
Davey: Maybe you are a leprechaun.
[Victoria’s Secret. Davey and Whitey are seen walking to the food court from the
entrance]
Whitey: Let’s just get some snacks and chat. Okay?
[The d
ressing rooms. A woman opens the door to see, who else, but the fat kid trying on
bras]
Fat Kid: Huh?
Woman: Aren’t you a boy?
[He runs off crying]
[The food court, Whitey picks up some food]
Whitey: Now I’d like to make this work out. But in order to
do so, you’re going to have
to learn
(shot of Jennifer and Benjamin from outside the banquet hall are seen working at
Dunkin’ Donuts. Benjamin points to Whitey)
that youth league basketball ain’t about you
and your lack of respect for others.
{They sit dow
n at a table overlooking the entire mall}
It’s about the kids and teaching them responsibility and teamwork. I’ve been doing my
part for 35 years. Are you ready to join me, big guy?
{Davey grabs the box of fries and
dumps it on the table, spelling out “BIT
E ME”} (smug)
Joke’s one you, tough guy. I
can’t read.
[Jennifer and Benjamin (with a Game Boy Advance in his hands) walk over to Whitey
with a bag]
Jennifer: Special delivery for Whitey Duvall, sugar
-
free donuts.
Whitey:
(grabbing the bag)
Every day sh
e does this for me! Jennifer, you’re too much.
(to Davey)
My fraternal twin sister’s a diabetic and out of respect for her and her disease,
I don’t eat sugar products.
Jennifer: There’s a surprise in there. I think you’re gonna like it.
Whitey:
(opening
the bag and feeling through)
Don’t tell me it’s Bavarian cream
-
filled.
(grabs a donut and eats it; joyous)
It is Bavarian cream
-
filled!
(standing on his chair and
dancing)
Hubba
-
bubba! These babies make my taste buds
do double daffies, for gosh
sakes! {
Je
nnifer looks at Davey for second, who scowls at her} (to Benjamin)
Hey, what
are you doing hiding over there?
Jennifer:
(pushing Benjamin over to Whitey)
It’s okay, sweetheart. Come talk to Whitey.
Benjamin: Hi, Whitey.
(pointing out his Game Boy)
I got a
nother Chanukah present
tonight.
Whitey: Wow, Benjamin, an Etch
-
A
-
Sketch. Not too shabby.
Davey: That’s a Game Boy, you idiot.
Whitey: Oh, sorry, I’m not up on modern technology. But I guess my friend Davey is.
(to
Benjamin)
Why don’t you tell him what
else you got.
Benjamin: First night, I got a basketball and some dreidels. Then, night two I got a pup
tent so I can camp in the backyard. And tonight, I got this.
Davey: Wow. Maybe on night four the Chanukah monster will take a big crap on your
bed.
Jennifer: Thanks for sharing the holiday spirit, psycho. Come on Benjamin, help me clean
the muffin trays. Bye, Whitey.
Benjamin: See you at the game tomorrow.
Davey:
(looking at Jennifer’s behind)
I’ll tell ya, your girlfriend’s backyard isn’t sugar
-
fre
e. That baby looks sweet.
Whitey:
(angry, interjecting Davey’s point
-
of
-
view)
Technical foul! Technical foul!
That’s a lady, and you will not speak about her in that way!
Davey:
(easing Whitey)
Easy.
Whitey: She happens to be going through a tough time
now. Last spring, her husband of
thirteen years ups and leaves her for some woman he met on the computer. She had the
courage to move back to town a month ago to try and raise her boy on her own.
Davey: So she’s available?
Whitey: Oh, you wish, mac. You
blew your shot with her twenty years ago.
Davey: Twenty years?
(in realization)
Was that Jennifer Friedman?
Whitey: I’m surprised you have enough brain cells left to remember.
[Flashback to 1981. The Jewish Community Center basketball court. A twelve y

Jennifer passes the ball to a twelve year

old Davey]
Davey: Hey, Jennifer, you still coming over to watch “Dukes of Hazzard”
after the game?
Jennifer: That’s a big 10

4, Davey.
Mr. Stone: Hey, Davey.
{pan over to Davey’s parents, wanting to take
a picture}
Smile!
Your mom wants to take a picture.
[Davey smiles for the camera while Jennifer smirks while gleaming at him, the picture is
taken]
Mrs. Stone: Thanks, honey.
Davey: If my parents fall asleep early, I’ll show you my basement.
Jennifer:
Keep dreaming.
[Cut to a 50 year
-
old Whitey, combing his...afro?]
Whitey: Ah, they make a nice couple boogie
-
oogie
-
oogies.
[Back to present day. Davey and Whitey walk over to the mayor (voiced by Kevin
Nealon) on the mall’s first floor]
Davey:
(to White
y)
I don’t know when you were goofier, then or now.
Whitey: Good evening, Mayor Stuey Duhy. Out for some late
-
night shopping?
Mayor: Yeah. Then I have to figure out how to rebuild our giant menorah and Santa.
Thanks for ruining the ice pageant again, Sto
ne.
[Outside the banquet hall. The music for
the song “Technical Foul” plays in the
background. The deer notice Davey walking up]
Davey: I’m just here to say I’m sorry to the little guy. I swear.
{The deer think otherwise}
If I give myself a wedgie, will you believe me then?
{The deer contemplate,
then agree}
(gives himself such a wedgie that the underwear rips right off and knocks him down)
Okay?
{The deer nod} (walks to the window)
Glad we could work that out.
[Inside the banquet hall]
Eleanore: I can’t believe I’m in the same room as the mayor.
Whitey: I can’t believe how many rolls you put in your purse.
[Eleanore pulls out her purse, filled to the brim with rolls]
Eleanore: It’ll be a nice snack for February.
[The kids snicker]
Mayor: Ladies and gentlemen, this next award, the Dukesberry
All
-
Star Patch was
created 35 years ago to recognize people for their tireless work ethic, their unparalleled
generosity and their passion and dedication to both the league and to our fine community.
Eleanore:
(to Whitey)
Your hands are sopping wet. Don’t
be so nervous, Whitey.
Whitey: I’m not nervous. I’m excited. I’ve been waiting 35 years for this night.
[Outside the banquet hall. The deer notice the police walking up. They contemplate what
to do. Policeman #3 walks up to see the deer doing a pyramid]
Policeman #4: You see something?
Policeman #3: Just some deer doing a pyramid.
Policeman #4: Okay, well, let’s keep looking.
[The deer collapse and walk back up to the window]
Davey: Good job, fellas.
[Inside the banquet hall. The mayor holds up the
patch]
Mayor: Hand
-
picked by you, the people of our fine town
{Whitey looks at it in hope}
I
now present the 35
th
annual Dukesberry All
-
Star Patch Award to...
(rips the envelope and
pulls out the slip)
Davey:
(looking from the window with the deer)
Please
let there be a miracle.
[Jennifer and Benjamin both cross their fingers. Whitey stands up, as if he knows it’s
him]
Mayor: ...Tom Baltezor!
{Whitey is crushed}
Tom, come up here and get this sucker!
[Tom Baltezor stands up (basically an animated Jon Lovit
z, who also voices him), while
Whitey is still trying to contemplate what is going on. Benjamin sadly looks down]
Man: Attaboy, Tommy!
[Davey tears up lowering his head as well. Whitey and Eleanore sadly gather up their
things. Whitey claps a few times a
nd enters out as the scene turns into slow
-
motion]
Davey:
(in Whitey’s mind as Whitey tears up)
Nobody in this town even knows you exist!
[Whitey exits while Eleanore steps in one more time]
Eleanore: All of people can bite my germ
-
free booty!
Townspeo
ple: Huh?
[Outside the banquet hall. Davey finishes crying]
Davey: Looks like I better do a lot more than just apologize. See you in ten years, fellas.
[Davey walks up to the double doors]
[Inside the banquet hall, Tom is at the podium]
Tom: When I wa
s a kid playing youth league ball for Palmer Episcopal, I dreamed of two
things: Learning to make a lay
-
up with my left hand and becoming a multi
-
billionaire. I
think you all know which dream came true.
[Tom pulls out a hook in place for his left hand, wh
ich shocks the CDW]
CDW: WOW! Sorry! That one caught me by surprise.
Tom: And even though I don’t recall scoring a point during my four seasons of play
(laughs with the townspeople) {Davey enters the banquet hall}
the memories of the fun
times I did have
made it very easy for me to purchase the new digital scoreboard for the
community center earlier this year. Thanks for the recognition.
[The crowd cheers]
Man: Thanks for the scoreboard!
Woman: Thank you, Tommy!
[Davey stands on a chair and addresses t
o the people]
Davey: Excuse me! Can I just say something?
Policeman #1:
(pointing)
There he is!
Mayor: Stone, what are you doing here?
Policeman #1:
(handcuffing Davey)
Getting himself arrested, Mayor Duhy cause he broke
into the mall.
CDW: I LOVE IT!
Your ass busted! Now you go to jail and marry big, smelly man.
Judge: Stone, you screwed up for the last time. That ten
-
year sentence I promised you
starts tonight.
Townspeople: Yeah!
Davey:
(tearing up)
Please, just let me speak for one second!
Benja
min:
(squinting)
Are those tears in his eyes?
Jennifer: Finally.
(stands up)
Let the guy talk! After all, it is the holidays.
Mrs. Selman:
(standing up)
She’s right. And THEN we’ll send him up the river!
Townspeople: Yeah!
Mayor: Okay, Mrs. Triple
-
Nipple
—
I, I mean Mrs. Selman. Go ahead, Mr. Stone. Let’s
hear your parting words of wisdom.
[The policemen let Davey go]
Davey: I know you people don’t like me, I know you don’t care about my opinion, but
here it goes. Tommy, nothing personal, but Whitey Duval
l should have won the patch
tonight and you people are all crazy for not realizing that.
Tom: Why would we give Whitey Duvall the patch? So he could use it as a blanket.
[The townspeople laugh uproariously. Tom tries to pat the Mayor with his hook, but i
t
just stabs him]
Mayor: Ow! Oww! Oww!!
Davey: That’s the reaction I thought I get.
[Music suddenly begins, starting up the musical number “Bum Biddy”]
Everyone in this room has been associated with Whitey, that through basketball or the
mall or variou
s odd jobs he does around town for free or a most a dollar!
And I’m guessing 99 percent of you have either laughed in Whitey’s face or ruthlessly
made fun of his feet or voice or sister or shortness when he wasn’t looking!
But the next time you’d see him,
he’d go out of his way to smile and wave at you and
ask about your mother’s operation or something like that because he, unlike us,
actually cares about somebody other than himself!
The reason I bring this up to you
Is because...I was the worst offender
O
f all...
(Reminisces about the past being mean to Whitey)
My life was simply going nowhere
Then a tiny little man rushed to my side
He should’ve gotten a big ”Thank you”
Instead he got a porta
-
potty ride
I was such a shithead
But he never quit on me
‘Til I
told him he was useless
And his sister was freaky!
[A family man stands up, and reminisces about watching a football game]
Family Man:
Once when we were watching Sunday football
A fuzzy screen was all that we could see
Whitey came over with hanger
And
spent the game on top of a TV
And then lightning stuck him
He let out a wicked, loud yell
But we just turned up the volume
And ignored the burning smell
—
We should all rot in hell!
[The old lady from “Davey’s Song” and the mall stands up and starts remini
scing about
a prank she played on Whitey back in high school]
Old Lady:
I went to high school with Whitey
As a joke I told him to “Meet me at the prom”
When he got there I told him “I can’t believe you thought I was serious”
So he ran home crying and slow
danced with his mom
Davey:
What a crushing blow to Whitey
I bet you wish you can take it back!
CDW:
How could you be all so mean to Whitey?
Seems to me you are all on crack!
[The homeless man gasps]
Jennifer:
Tonight Whitey was counting on this town
To show him that we car
-
are
But the first time he really needed us
We weren’t there!
(holds the line until Davey finishes his)
Benjamin:
And on Christmas eve and the last night of Chanukah!
Davey:
It’s just not fair!!
[Policeman #2 starts dancing in t
he aisles]
Policeman #2:
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum bum
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum
[The CDW joins him]
CDW:
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum bum
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum
Davey:
(about Tom)
I wonder if that guy ever wiped his ass with the wrong hand?
Tom:
(as
hamed)
Yes.
All:
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum bum
Bum biddy biddy bum
[Outside the banquet hall, looking over]
All:
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum bum
Bum biddy biddy biddy bum
(fading out)
Bum biddy biddy biddy...
[Cut to Whitey’s car driving to the mall]
Ele
anore:
(offscreen)
I’m so sorry they hurt you, Whitey.
Whitey:
(offscreen)
We should go to the mall.
[Inside Whitey’s car]
Whitey: That place always makes me feel better.
Eleanore:
(strapped tightly to her seat)
But it’s closed.
Whitey: Maybe the nigh
t guard forgot to lock the door again.
Eleanore: Well, if he didn’t, we can at least sit in front of it. These are desperate times!
[Outside the mall. Whitey approaches the door]
Whitey: Let the door be open. Please, just give me that.
[Whitey successf
ully opens the door]
Eleanore: Oh, thank god!
[Inside the mall. Whitey and Eleanore walk to the main rotunda]
Eleanore: This is the most beautiful place I’ve ever seen. It’s like a sanctuary.
Whitey: Eleanore, could you just give me a second to say a f
ew words in private?
Eleanore:
(hugging Whitey)
Take as much time as you need, Whitey.
Whitey:
(takes off his coat and walks to the dead center of the rotunda. He sits on his
knees)
Hey, mall, long time, no see. Fourteen hours to be exact. If you haven’
t heard by
now, I didn’t get that patch I’ve been telling you about for all these years. In fact, I’ve
been kind of kidding myself to even think I was in the running. You see, the people of
Dukesberry think I’m nothing but a joke. So I was kind of thinking
, maybe I should move
to a town where nobody knows who I am.
(the Foot Locker Man sheds a tear, as well as
the Panda Express Panda)
At least then they’d have a reason not to acknowledge me. I
think Eleanore might like Florida, and I hear they got some pret
ty amazing malls there.
Davey:
(offscreen)
You’re not going anywhere.
Whitey: Huh?
Eleanore: Holy shit, did the mall just say something?!
Davey:
(walking out of the shadows)
No, it was me.
Whitey: What do you want, Stone?
Davey: I came to apologize, W
hitey.
Whitey: Well, there’s nothing to apologize for, Stone, because you were right. Nobody
does care about me.
Davey: I don’t think that’s true. Do you, Mr. Mayor?
[The mayor walks out]
Mayor: Whitey, tonight for the first time in years, your
partner, Davey Stone, actually did
a good thing for this community.
Eleanore: What he do, steal beer for everyone?
Mayor: No, Eleanore. He made me open my eyes to see what a great man your brother is
and how neglectful we’ve all been. That’s why I’m White
y. I’m here to fix a big mistake.
[The mall suddenly lights up and becomes golden. Music immediately begins for the
grand finale “It’s Your Moment, Whitey!”]
All:
It’s your moment, Whitey
You’ve waited oh, so long
It’s your moment, Whitey
We’re here to
right our wrong
[The mayor rips the patch off of Tom]
Tom: Oww!
(stabs himself with his hook)
Oww!!
Mayor: Whitey Duvall, for service to the league and this community, I proudly present to
you the 35
th
annual Dukesberry All
-
Star Patch.
[Whitey grabs th
e patch]
Whitey: But this is Tom’s.
Tom: Mr. Duvall, the 35

All

Star Patch is now where it belongs.
Whitey: I can’t believe this is happening.

[Whitey wal
ks over to Davey]
Whitey: You stepped up for me, Stone. I don’t know if I could ever repay you.
Davey: Well, you can help me with my dream.
Whitey: You got a dream? What is it?
Davey: To have someone wish me a happy Chanukah and feel as good as I used
to when
my dad would say it to me.
Whitey: Happy Chanukah, Stone.
Davey: Merry Christmas, Whitey.
[They hug]
Townspeople: Awww...
Whitey: You know, Stone, if my imaginary wife and I ever have a son, I hope you
consider him a brother.
Davey: Thanks, Whit
ey. And I’ll pretend I never heard you say that.
Whitey: Appreciate it.
[Whitey is picked up and held by some townspeople, where he goes on thanking people]
All:
It’s your moment, Whitey
Enjoy, our tiny friend
Like the Bavarian cream

You a
te last week
Eleanore:
(to Davey and Jennifer)
Would you three show Whitey and I how to light the
Chanukah candles at our house tonight?
Jennifer:
(to Benjamin)
You up for that, pal?
[Benjamin laughs in joy]
Eleanore: And when Benjamin falls asleep the
both of you can play Spin the Dreidel for
tongue kisses.
Davey: Sounds good to me.
Eleanore:
(making Davey and Jennifer hold hands)
Now, go live, happily ever after or I’ll
dropkick the teeth out of your mouth.
Davey:
(happily)
That won’t be necessary.
Mrs. Selman:
(breastfeeding three babies on her three different breasts)
Aww, they make
a nice couple.
Whitey:
(regal)
I never...want this to...end!!
Patch!
[Whitey starts going into another seizure]
Narrator: Don’t worry, folks. Whitey’s okay.
Whitey:
(
in seizure)
This is the happiest seizure of my life!
Narrator: See, I told you.
[Cut to black]
Whitey: Yeaa...
THE END
