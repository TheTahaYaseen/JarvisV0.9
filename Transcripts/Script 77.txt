<b>Beast</b>: [Low Growl] Christmas! She’s planning Christmas!
<b>Forte</b>: Yes. Awful, isn’t it?
<b>Beast</b><span>: </span>[Growling] Perhaps, she doesn’t know how I feel about Christmas.
<b>Forte</b>: But, she does know.
<b>Beast</b><span>: </span>Hmm? She just doesn’t care like I do. She’s actually trying to bring Christmas back to the castle.
<b>Forte</b>: And you know how much we despise Christmas.
<b>Beast</b><span>: </span>The day my life ended.
[<i>Flashback</i>]
<b>Prince</b>: Bring me my presents!
<b>Lumière</b>: Here, Your Highness. Please accept this humble gift as a token of our appreciation. I know I speak for everyone when…
<b>Prince</b>: Ah, just give it to me! A storybook? You call this a present? I hope you have something better for me, Forte.
<b>Forte</b>: Yes, sir. Of course, Master.
♪♪ [<i>Slow</i>]
<b>Prince</b>: What is that?
<b>Forte</b>: Um, a small piece in your honour, Master.
<b>Prince</b>: Eeew! I hate it. Forte, that stuff is gloomy.
[<i>Knocking</i>]
<b>Prince</b>: [<i>Shouting</i>] Who disturbs my Christmas?!
<b>Old woman</b>: Please, take this rose… in exchange for shelter from the bitter cold.
<b>Prince</b>: [<i>Scoffs</i>] I don’t need a rose. Go away, you wretched old hag! (The old woman becomes the Echantress.)
<b>The Enchantress</b>: You have been deceived by your own cold heart. A curse upon your house and all within it. Until you have found one to love you as you are, you shall remain forever… a beast.
[<i>Growling, Screaming</i>] [<i>Snarling, Roaring</i>]
<b>Forte</b>: But we’ve come so far since then. We’ve risen above the tragedy.
<b>Beast</b>: Where is she?
<span><b>Forte</b>: </span>I believe she’s gone to the boiler room, or so a little birdie told me.
<span><b>Fife</b>: </span>[Chuckling] Tweet, tweet, tweet.
<b>Axe</b>: <i>(shouting)</i> Hey, what am I payin’ you for, being boring? Do that on your own time. Get outta here!
<i>[The Workers get back to work stoking the boiler, chattering.]</i>
<b>Belle</b>: <i>(checking over the yule log)</i> Yes. <i>(hears a loud nose)</i> Oh!
<i>(Beast has arrived in the boiler room, having knocked down the doors. Belle hums innocently, as Beast gets close to her. She gasps but continues humming.)</i>
<b>Beast</b>: (<i>sharply</i>) What are you hiding? <i>(He huffs and growls, finally snatching the yule log from Belle, as he then inspects it.)</i>
<b>Belle</b><span class="">: </span>It’s, uh, a Yule log.
<b>Beast</b><span>:</span> Huh?
<b>Belle</b><span>: A-a </span>Yule log. It’s a wonderful tradition. One log is chosen, and everyone in the house touches it… and makes a Christmas wish.
<b>Beast</b>: <i>(bitterly)</i> Mmm, wishes are stupid. <i>[growls]</i> You made a Christmas wish last year. <i>(bellows)</i> IS THIS WHAT YOU WISHED FOR?! <i>[He roars, causing a flock of bats to fly through an open hole in the wall and above the boiler room.]</i>
<b>Belle</b>: <i>(remaining firm)</i> No.
<b>Beast</b>: <i>[Grunts]</i>
<span><b>Belle</b>: </span>But I will keep wishing. And when the log is burned on Christmas morning…
<span><b>Beast</b>: </span>There will be no Christmas.
<span><b>Belle</b>: </span>But…
<span><b>Beast</b>:</span> <i>(bellows, interrupting Belle)</i> NO! I am the master here.
<span><b>Belle</b>: <i>(upset)</i> </span>How can you be so selfish?
<span><b>Beast</b>: <i>(bitterly)</i> </span>You cannot possibly understand. <i>(Belle frowns as she listens to him ranting.)</i> You have no idea what it’s like to lose everything, to be trapped in your own castle, to be, uh… <i>(growls, losing focus)</i>
<b>Belle</b>: Prisoner? <i>(Beast becomes silent, taken aback, as the boiler room staff watches Belle argue back.)</i> The only one holding us prisoner here is you. Well, I’m not giving up. (<i>She walks away from Beast and looks back at him one last time.)</i>
<b>Beast</b>: <i>(holding the log, mournfully)</i> Prisoner.
<i>(Belle then leaves the boiler room.)</i>
<b>Belle</b><span>: </span>[Sighs]
<b>Chip</b>: Hiya, Belle. You should see the ballroom. It’s all decorated and pretty. and there’s garlands everywhere. I think the master’s gonna be really excited when he finds out about Christmas.
<b>Belle</b><span>: </span>Well, he, he already knows.
<b>Chip</b><span>: </span>Really? Was he excited?
<b>Belle</b><span>: </span>Actually, Chip, he’s forbidden it.
<b>Chip</b><span>: </span>But, I thought he couldn’t forbid Christmas.
<b>Belle</b><span>: </span>You know, Chip, he can’t. We’ll have Christmas with or without him.
<b>Chip</b><span class="">: </span>Hooray! Can we get a tree now, Belle? It’s the only thing we’re missing.
<b>Belle</b><span class="">: </span>All right, then. Let’s go get a tree. But first…
<b>Chip</b><span>: <i>(whispering)</i> </span>Shh. Psst, Belle. <i>(He sees the Beast on his way toward the West Wing.)</i> The master. Hurry.
<i>(Belle sets the present aside the bell jar and runs off for the door. Beast enters his private room, growling to himself. Belle comes out from behind the door and walks down the hallway, undetected.)</i>
<i>(Outside, Chip bounces through the snow, laughing and enjoying himself. Belle walks onto the castle grounds with an axe in her hand, as Sultan runs beside her, panting. The two friends come upon a skinny tree.)</i>
<b>Chip</b>: What about this one?
<b>Belle</b>: Mmm… <i>[Disapprovingly]</i> Mmm. <i>(Chip imagines an ornament appearing on the tree and bringing the tree down with its weight to the ground, similar to the one from "A Charlie Brown Christmas". Chip frowns at this.)</i> Nah. Too skinny. Come on.
<b>Chip</b>: [Exhales]
[They continue through the castle grounds, as Axe is seen on Belle's shoulder, as he groans at this. All the while, Beast watches them, coldly from his West Wing, as thunder rumbles. The door is heard creaking, as Lumiere enters.]
<span><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>Ooo la-la.
<span><b>Beast</b>: </span>Ohh, Lumiere.
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: (looking through the window, next to Beast) </span>She’s beautiful, no?
<span><b>Beast</b>: </span>Yes, and I’m hideous.
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>(<i>softly</i>) Not to mention ill-tempered.
<b>Beast</b>: (offended) What? (He notices the present next to the bell jar.) What is that?
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>Ooh, it looks like a Christmas present.
<span><b>Beast</b>: </span>[Roars]
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: (<i>keeping composure</i>) </span>Oh-ho-ho. It’s for you, Master. It’s from… a girl.
<span><b>Beast</b>:</span> Mrs Potts?
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>No. From Belle.
<span><b>Beast</b>: </span>Belle? (<i>He walks over to the present, curiously, and goes to untie the bow.</i>)
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: (<i>interrupting</i>) </span>Uh-uh-uh. Master, you can’t open it.
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>Well, why not? It’s for me, isn’t it?
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>Because it’s not yet Christmas.
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>:</span> [Growls]
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>: </span>Master, we all understand how you feel about Christmas. But when a woman gives a man a gift, she’s saying, "I care about you."
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>Hmm. But I don’t have a gift for her.
<span class=""><b>Lumiere</b>:</span> It is not too late.
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>(<i>sighs, reluctantly</i>) Well, I guess I could get her a little something.
(<i>In Forte's parlor, Forte plays a gloomy piece, when Beast arrives.</i>)
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>Forte, stop the noise!
<b>Forte</b>: Noise? Noise?! This is my masterpiece.
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>:</span> [Growls]
<span><b>Forte</b>: </span>Master.
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>I, I want you to compose a song. It’s a present for Belle.
<span><b>Forte</b>:</span> What? Belle?
<span class=""><b>Beast</b>: </span>And make it… happy!
<span><b>Forte</b>: </span>Oh, but happiness is so… depressing. What’s next? Love songs? (<i>He plays a gloomy sounding sample, while Sultan is heard panting outside.</i>) Wedding marches? (Beast leaves the parlor.) It’s all that girl’s fault.
(<i>Fife bounces into the parlor and looks through the window. Outside, Sultan barks and snarls, as he, Belle, and Chip have come upon another tree.</i>)
<b>Belle</b>: What about this one?
<b>Chip</b>: Hmm, too wiggly.
<span><b>Belle</b>: </span>Too wiggly?
(<i>Back inside, Forte gets an idea.</i>)
<b>Forte</b>: Fife! [He sounds off blaring notes, as Fife gasps and looks at him.] Pay attention. I need you to pace when I think. The girl is evil, I tell you. She pulls him from my grasp. She fills his head with dreams of love and hope… and Christmas!
<b>Fife</b>: Well, what you gonna do? You can’t stop Christmas.
<b>Forte</b><span>: </span>[Chuckles] No, but I can stop the girl.
(Outside, Sultan continues barking, as Belle and Chip have come to the last tree.)
<b>Belle</b>: Chip, this is the last one.
<b>Chip</b>: That’s not it. That’s just a weed wishing it was a tree.
<b>Belle</b>: Chip, we’ve looked at every tree on the grounds.
<b>Forte</b>: And now for a little Fife.
<b>Belle</b>: Sultan, wait!
