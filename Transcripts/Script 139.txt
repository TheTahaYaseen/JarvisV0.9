<b>Miguel:</b> Sometimes, I think I'm cursed. Because of something that happened before I was even born.
<i>(Then the papers reveal what happened in the moment Imelda and Hector were together.)</i>
<b>Miguel:</b> See, a long time ago, there was this family. The papa, he was a musician. He and his family would sing and dance and count their blessings. But he also had a dream. To play for the world. And one day, he left with his guitar and never returned. And the mama... She didn't have time to cry over that walk-away musician. After banishing all music from her life she found a way to provide for her daughter. She rolled up her sleeves and sh learned to make shoes. She could have made candy, or fireworks, or sparkly underwear for wrestlers, but no, she chose shoes. Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. Music had torn her family apart. But shoes held them all together. You see, that woman was my great-great grandmother, Mama Imelda. She died way before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on <i>Dia de los Muertos,</i> the Day of the Dead. And her little girl, she's my great-grandmother, Mama Coco. 
<b>Miguel:</b> Hola, Mama Coco.
<b>Mama Coco:</b> How are you, Julio?
<b>Miguel:</b> Actually, my name is Miguel. <i>(he gives Mama Coco a piece of orange and he eats the other one himself.)</i> Mama Coco has trouble remembering things, but it's good to talk to her anyway. So... I tell her pretty much about everything.
<i>(Miguel shows Mama Coco how he runs)</i>
<b>Miguel:</b> I used to run like this. <i>(then he shows her how faster he runs)</i> But I run like this, and just way faster.
<i>(Then it shows Miguel disguised as a wrestler in the bed and jumps in a pillow)</i>
<b>Miguel:</b> And the winner is... Luchadora Coco.
