So, how’d it go?
Well, the King and his daughter
don’t exactly see eye to eye.
She seems to like us OK,
but the King…
I don’t know, I think
he’s hiding somethin’.
Well, if he’s hiding something,
I want to know what it is.
Someone needs to
talk to that girl.
I will go!
Someone with good people skills.
I will do it!
Someone who won’t
scare her away.
I volunteer!
Someone who can
speak the language.
For the good
of the mission, I will go!
Good man, Thatch.
Thanks for volunteering.
(Sobbing)
Go get ‘em, tiger.
OK, Milo, don’t take
no for an answer.
"Look, I have
some questions for you…
and I’m not leaving this city
until they’re answered!"
Yeah, that’s it.
That’s good, that’s good.
I have some
questions for you…
and you are not
leaving this city…
until they are answered.
Yeah, well, l… OK.
Shh!
Come with me.
Oh, there is so much
to ask about your world.
You are a scholar, are you not?
Judging from your
diminished physique…
and large forehead…
you are suited for nothing else.
What is your
country of origin?
When did the flood
waters recede?
- How did you…
- Wait a minute.
I got a few questions
for you, too.
So let’s do this, OK?
You ask one,
then I’ll ask one…
then you, then me, then…
Well, you get it.
Very well.
What is your first question?
Well, OK, uh,
how did you get here?
Well, I mean,
not you personally…
but your… your culture.
I mean, how did all of this
end up down here?
It is said that the gods became
jealous of Atlantis.
They sent a great cataclysm
and banished us here.
All I can remember
is the sky going dark…
and people shouting
and running.
Then, a bright light,
like a star…
floating above the city.
My father said it called
my mother to it.
I never saw her again.
I’m sorry. If it…
if it’s any consolation…
l-I know how you feel,
because I lost my…
Wait a minute. Wait a minute!
Whoa, back up!
Wh… what… what are
you telling me…
that you remember
because you were there?
No, that… that’s impossible…
because, I mean,
that would make you…
you know,
Yes.
Oh, well, hey, uh, pfft!
Lookin’ good.
Just, uh, ahem…
You got another question for me?
Yes. How is it you found
your way to this place?
Well, I’ll tell you,
it wasn’t easy.
If it weren’t for this book,
we never would have made it.
OK, second question.
Legend has it
that your people possessed…
a power source of some kind
that enabled them…
You mean you can
understand this?
Yes, I’m a linguist.
That’s what I do,
that’s my job.
Now, getting back
to my question…
This, right here,
you can read this?
Yes, yes, I can read Atlantean,
just like you.
You can’t, can you?
No one can.
Such knowledge
has been lost to us…
since the time
of the Mehbelmok.
Oh, the Great Flood.
Show me.
OK, uh…
(Reading in Atlantean)
"Follow the narrow passage
for another league.
There you will find
the fifth marker."
Yeah. Yeah, that’s it.
How was my accent?
Boorish, provincial…
and you speak it
through your nose.
Yeah, gotta work
on that.
Here, let me
show you something.
What? It looks like
some sort of vehicle.
Yes. But no matter
what I try…
it will not respond.
- Perhaps if…
- Way ahead of you.
OK, let’s see
what we got here.
OK. "Place crystal into slot."
Yes, yes,
I have done that!
"Gently place your hand
on the inscription pad."
- Yes!
- OK, did you…
turn the crystal
one-quarter turn back?
Yes. Yes!
While your hand was
on the inscription pad?
Ye… No.
Ah, well, see, there’s
your problem right there.
That’s an easy thing
to miss.
You know, you deserve credit…
for even… even
gettin’ this far.
OK, uh, give it a try.
(Gasps)
(Speaking Atlantean)
Yeah, you got
that right.
Oh, th… this is great!
With this thing…
I could see the whole city
in no time at all.
Wonder how fast it goes.
(Crashing)
(Crash)
(Sputters)
So, who’s hungry?
By the way, we were never
properly introduced.
My name’s Milo.
My name is Kidagakash.
Ki-Ki-Kidamaschnaga.
Uh, hey,
you got a nickname?
(Giggles)
Kida.
OK, Kida.
I can remember that.
Wow.
(Sighs)
What is wrong?
Oh, it’s nothing. I just…
got something in my eye.
You know, my grandpa
used to tell me stories…
about this place
as far back as I can remember.
I just wish he could be
standing here with me.
(Speaking Atlantean)
Ah! Ah! Ee-yah!
(Crunch)
Tell me more about
your companions.
Your physician,
he is called Cookie?
No, that’s Sweet.
What is?
The doctor.
He’s Sweet.
Oh, he is kindly.
No, no, no, that…
that’s his name.
His name is Kindly?
No, Sweet.
Well, I mean, he’s kindly, too.
So all of your doctors
are sweet and kindly?
No. Well,
l-I’m sure some are.
Ours is, but that’s
not a requirement.
You’re missing the point.
You are confusing me.
Wow. Look at all
those tattoos.
Shoot. That
ain’t nothin’.
Look here what I got.
All 38 United States.
Watch me make
Rhode Island dance.
Go on, baby,
dance. Dance.
(SIoshing)
There you go.
(Giggling)
(Speaking Atlantean)
Cookies are sweet,
but yours is not.
Sweet is kindly,
but that is not his name.
Audrey is sweet,
but she is not your doctor.
And the little digging
animal called Mole…
he is your pet?
Close enough.
(Slurping)
Oh, don’t forget
to eat the head.
That’s where all
the nutrients are.
(Swallows and burps)
(Footsteps)
(Breathing through gas mask)

MILO: No, don’t.
Don’t touch her.
(People murmuring)

<i>(He walks to the rocks and sits down sulking)</i>
Where are you going?
I’m going after Rourke.
Milo, that’s crazy.
I didn’t say
it was the smart thing…
but it is the right thing.
(Sighs)
Come on. We better make sure
he doesn’t hurt himself.
Milo, what do you think
you are doing?
Just follow my lead.
(Engine revs)
Wow.
I’m impressed.
It’s simple.
All you got to do…
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Shut up. We get it, OK?
No, no, wait!
(Thud)
(Atlanteans gasp)
Gently.
Just gently.
Hey, Milo,
you got something sporty?
You know, like a tuna?
How is this done?
All you got to do
is use the crystals.
Kida showed me.
Half-turn right,
quarter-run back.
Keep your hand
on the pad.
Saddle up, partners.
Bring jerky and ammo.
(Engines revving)
I’m so excited.
MILO:
All right, this is it!
We’re going to rescue
the princess.
We’re going to save
Atlantis.
Or we’re going to die trying.
Now let’s do it!
(Atlanteans cheering)
(Explosion)
OK, here’s the plan.
We’re going to come in
low and fast…
and take them by surprise.
Well, I’ve got
news for you, Milo.
Rourke is never surprised,
and he’s got a lot of guns.
Great. Well, do you have
any suggestions?
Yeah.
Don’t get shot.
There they are!
We’ve got company!
Take off!
Take her up!
(Gunfire)
Holy smokes!
You told me
he only had guns.
What I said was,
he’s never surprised.
OK, now things
are getting good.
Vinny! Heads up!
We can’t let them reach
the top of that shaft!
Aah!
Vinny, new plan.
You and me, we’re going
to be decoys.
Audrey, Sweet, fly up
underneath that thing…
and cut her loose.
SWEET: We’re on it.
Lieutenant!
I though you said
this thing…
could cut through
a femur in 28 seconds!
Less talk, more saw.
Uhh!
Looks like somebody’s
working overtime.
Come on, girl.
Time’s up.
AUDREY: Whoa!
All right, Milo,
this is it.
Any last words?
Yeah. I really wish I had
a better idea than this!
ROURKE:
We’re losing altitude.
Lighten the load.
Unh!
That’s it, unless
someone wants to jump.
Ladies first.
Uhh!
HELGA: You said
we were in this together!
Uhh!
You promised me
a percentage!
Next time,
get it in writing.
Aah!
Nothing personal.
Unh! Yaah!
Aah!
- Uhh!
- Unh!
- Aah!
- Uhh!
Well, I have
to hand it to you.
You’re a bigger
pain in the neck…
than I would have
ever thought possible.
I consider myself
an even-tempered man.
It takes a lot
to get under my skin…
but congratulations…
you just won
the solid-gold kewpie doll.
(Metal creaks)
Uhh…
Uhh! Uhh!
Nothing personal.
Tired, Mr. Thatch?
Hyah!
Aw, that’s a darn shame…
because I’m just
getting warmed up.
Aah!
(Rumbling)
Aah! Aah!
(Shrieks)
Aah!
Thank heaven.
Whoa!
(Growls)
(Shrieks)
(Groaning)
Uhh!
Ahh.
Oh, great!
Ahh.
(Rumbling)
MOLE: The volcano…
she awakes!
Hey, I had nothing
to do with it.
COOKIE: This here would be
a good place not to be.
No, wait.
We got to get her back…
or the whole city
will die.
And if we don’t get
out of here, we’ll die.
It’s the only way
to reverse this.
MILO: Just do it!
AUDREY:
Milo, no!
Go!
MILO: Aah!
Whoa!
Whoa!
The fissure…
it is about to eject…
its pyroclastic fury!
Milo, Mole says
the wall’s going to blow!
Unh! Uhh!
(Atlanteans gasp)
(Voices murmuring)
