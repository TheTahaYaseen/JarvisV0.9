for inviting everyone in the whole world but my mother to their stupid christening.
♫ Look at you, look at me ♫<br/>
♫ I don't know who to be ♫<br/>
♫ Mother ♫<br/>
♫ Is it wrong? Is it right? ♫<br/>
♫ Be a thief in the night ♫<br/>
♫ Mother ♫<br/>
♫ Tell me what to do... ♫
♫ I was once like you my child, slightly insecure ♫<br/>
♫ Argued with my mother too thought I was mature ♫<br/>
♫ But I put my heart aside, and I used my head ♫<br/>
♫ Now I think it's time you learned what dear old momma said ♫<br/>
<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be evil like me? ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be mean? ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna make mischief your daily routine? ♫<br/>
♫ Well you can spend your life attending to the poor ♫<br/>
♫ But when you're evil doing less is doing more ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be ruthless and rotten and mad? ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be very very good at being bad? ♫<br/>
<br/>
♫ I have tried my whole life long to do the worst I can ♫<br/>
♫ Clawed my way to victory built my master plan ♫<br/>
♫ Now the time has come my dear for you to take your place ♫<br/>
♫ Promise me you'll try to be an absolute disgrace ♫<br/>
<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be evil like me don't you wanna be cruel ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be nasty and brutal and cool ♫<br/>
♫ And when you grab that wand that's when your reign begins ♫<br/>
♫ Who wants an evil queen without a sack of sin ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be heartless and hardened as stone ♫<br/>
♫ Don't you wanna be finger lickin' evil to the bone ♫<br/>
<br/>
♫ This is not for us to ponder this was pre-ordained ♫<br/>
♫ You and I shall rule together freedom soon regained ♫<br/>
♫ Mistress of the universe powerful and strong ♫<br/>
♫ Daughter, hear me, help me, join me won't you sing along ♫
♫ Yes spiteful that's nice<br/>
♫ In just an hour or two our futures safe and sure ♫<br/>
♫ This mother daughter act is going out on tour ♫<br/>
♫ If you wanna be evil and awful and free ♫<br/>
♫ Then you should thank your lucky stars that you were born the girl you are ♫<br/>
♫ The daughter of an evilicious queen like me ♫

Tell me something.
♫ A million thoughts in my head ♫<br/>
♫ Should I let my heart keep listening? ♫<br/>
♫ Cause up 'til now, I've walked the line ♫<br/>
♫ Nothing lost but something missing ♫<br/>
♫ I can't decide what's wrong, what's right ♫<br/>
♫ Which way should I go?<br/>
<br/>
♫ If only I knew what my heart was telling me ♫<br/>
♫ Don't know what I'm feeling ♫<br/>
♫ Is this just a dream? ♫<br/>

♫ Don't know what I'm feeling ♫<br/>
♫ Is this just a dream? ♫<br/>
♫ Ah oh... ♫<br/>
♫ If only I could read the signs in front of me ♫<br/>
