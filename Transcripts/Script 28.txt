Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
It's him, boss.
I don't get it.
Mr. Carface, I know
what you're thinking,
But I don't know nothin'
about this.
We set him up for good.
Killer,
I do not wish
that I should share
50% of the business
with my partner Charlie.
You want
that I should go
Squeeze his head
with the pliers?
Killer, that is no way
to treat an old friend.
Friends must be handled
In a friendly
and businesslike way.
Carface!
Carface!
Ha ha ha!
Hey, Carface, you decent?
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Charlie!
Oh, is it
really you?
Is it really me?
Is it really you?
Hey, you've put on
a little weight.
I told you
to stay off sweets.
This place
is looking ok--
A little gauche,
but ok.
You know, partner,
I'm proud of you,
But the customers
ain't laughin'.
Gamblers are never
happy, Charlie.
You know that.
Yeah, but I've been
thinking.
What this place needs,
besides new curtains,
Is some class,
culture, choreography,
And some influence
of the theater.
Dancing girls.
What do you say?
Charlie, times has changed.
I've changed, you've changed.
What are you
talking about?
I haven't changed.
Charlie, you done time.
That's not good
for business.
What are you saying?
You are a dog
with a record.
I was framed!
I know. You're like
a brother to me.
That's why...why...
why what?
We need to split up
the partnership.
What? Are you
out of your mind?
They'll be looking
for you,
And what's the first place
they're gonna look?
Here. Here!
I don't like it,
Charlie,
But it's
for our own good.
Did it eat yet?
Yeah, it ate,
But how come
i got to feed
Carface's
little monster?
Huh! Monster!
Come on, dogs,
you've got a job to do.
Carface wants you should
get rid of Charlie.
Charlie?
Oh. Oh! Ooh! Ah!
Charlie!
They're going to
kill you, Charlie!
Charlie!
We'll set you up
somewheres
Where they don't
know you.
Yeah? Go on.
50% of this
is yours, right?
Charlie, take it.
You want a cut
of the steaks?
T-Bones?
Sure.
Porterhouse.
And one half
of the mignons.
This is sounding better
all the time.
Then it's a deal?
Well...
deal.
Put her there.
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Boys, listen up!
My former partner
wishes to announce
That he is going
into business for himself.
You heard the boss.
Shut up!
Boys, to the mardi gras!
Charlie?
Uh, Charlie?
Ooh!
Ouch!
Watch those heels, lady.
And I am sure that I speak
For every dog amongst us
In wishing you
the best of luck
In your new venture.
And now, as a token
of our esteem,
We are presenting to you
This lucky gold watch!
Heh heh heh.
Ha ha ha!
Takes a licking
and keeps on ticking.
keep a good dog... #
Killer.
Uh-Huh.
Take Charlie out back
for the big surprise.
Surprise?
What surprise, boss?
The big...
surprise.
Oh, ho ho!
You mean...
that surprise?
Oh...
oh...

Hee hee hee!
You're
the doggonedest pal
A swell could ever have.
Ha ha.
I love you guys.
You want to sing

Ooh!
Good-Bye, Charlie.
Heh heh heh!
Boss, can I help you
push the car? Please?
Charlie!
Ha ha ha.
Huh huh!
Killer, shut up!
Huh! Where am i?
This is the great hall
of judgment.
Judgment?!
Oh, not to worry,
Charlie.
You'll go to heaven.
All dogs go
to heaven
Because,
unlike people,
Dogs are naturally good
and loyal and kind.
That's true.
whatever you wish #
This is really a lovely place
you got here.
you please #
Follow me...
temperate climate #
73 degrees #
We're still
on Fahrenheit here.
That's fine with me.

Oh, boy.
lm instead #
Ah, great.
What?
You mean I'm--I'm--
Stone cold,
I'm afraid.
I can't believe it!
I've been murdered!
I'm having trouble
Finding any goodness
or loyalty here,
But let me see.
He killed me!
I beg your pardon?
A mistake's
been made here!
the wrong guy #
by a dirty rat #
was a dog #
, I just blew out of jail #
to explain #
to your superior? #
want to die! #
g whatever you wish #
the wrong guy #
and singing all day #
Listen!
My time's not up yet.
Oh, it is. There's
no mistake about that.
We know everything.
Murdered in the prime
of my life!
Damn That Carface,
I'll kill him.
Hey, this must be
the watch department.
You might
call it that.
See, this watch
is your life...
and it's stopped.
Well, can't you just
wind it up or something?
And send you back?
Oh, no, no, no.
No one's ever
allowed to go back.
Put your paw
right here.
What's that for?
For our book
of records.
Everything about you
that was or will be
Is right here.
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
I love it here.
You mean there's
no surprises or anything?
Oh, no, no, no.
We know everything.
That's just lovely.
The clouds, the grass,
the air.
Heaven is
a wonderful place!
Yeah.
No surprises, huh?
Say...
would you like to dance?
You mean if I'm waiting for
an inside straight up here,
I'd know in advance
whether I filled it?
We know how
it all turns out.
You must have
studied dancing.
You have natural rhythm,
unusual for a whippet.
Oh, I'm getting dizzy!
Everything
is so lovely here--
So planned,
so ordered.
That's what's
driving me crazy.
bo bo bo #
there'd be snow #

Charlie, what are
you doing?
What's that you have
behind your back?
Charlie, don't
wind that watch!
Charlie!
You can never come back!
I'm alive.
Charlie, you can
never come back.
You can never come--
Oh!
Oh!
Charlie.
Charlie!
Look out!
Charlie! No!
No!
Itchy, it's ok.
It's ok, little buddy.
It's me. Charlie.
Oh, Charlie!
Charlie, it's you!
I saw Carface,
and he was choking me.
He was grabbing
my neck, and--
Oh, hi, Charlie.
Hi.
Aarrrgghh!
Shh!
Charlie!
You're a ghost!
Get back! Get back!
Don't hurt me.
Here. Take my nine-Piece
ratchet set.
My oil can!
Don't go without my
rolls-Royce hood ornament.
I'm not dead.
Please, I got
a bad back.
Quiet!
Itchy, I'm not a ghost.
I'm not dead.
Now, be quiet.
I'm going to take my hand
away from your mouth,
And you're going to be quiet,
aren't you?
Ha ha!
That's my pal.
Aahh!
Will you shut up?
Itchy, I'm alive!
Look.
Do ghosts have fleas?
No. Ghosts
don't have fleas.
Right.
Charlie, Charlie,
it's really you.
But I saw the car
and the river...
i know.
And your lifeless body
flying through the air.
Itchy, what can I say?
It wasn't my time.
I'm so happy
to see you, Charlie!
You don't know
how much I missed you!
Shut up!
You want the whole world
to know I'm back?
You thought I was dead.
So will Carface.
He tried to kill me.
I'll make him pay!
We don't want to
do that.
We do. I was
the brains of the outfit.
When I left,
he should have gone under.
That's it, boss.
We'll go under.
Deep, deep under.
I don't want to go under.
The operation grew.
It got bigger.
Now he won't share.
We could share
a nice little place
In the Himalayas.
I hate the Himalayas.
Wait. They got
gambling, races.
Well, they even got
a town called Tibet.
You know, to-Bet.
We could nab llamas,
mountain goats,
Open our own track, boss.
He's got something
up his sleeve.
Yeah, a gun.
When I find out
what it is,
I'm gonna ruin him.
I'm gonna make him
suffer...slow.
He'll be begging
for mercy.
I'm begging that
we get out of here.
Boss,
Carface has got thugs,
And they got muscles,
knives.
And he's got a monster
in his basement.
What?
Boss, they feed it!
Monster?
Yeah, monster!
I said monster!
Monster?
Hmm. Ha ha!
Charlie, I just know
we're both going to die.
Shut up!
Now, let me see here.
Stop it! Stop it!
Will you quit that?
I've had it
with your itching.
Oh.
Hey, look,
look, look, look!
See...see...
the monster?
The monster?
Ok. Now
let's go home.
Who knows
what it eats?
Ahh! Yah!
Somebody's got me--
I got you
by the tail!
Why don't you tell somebody
you're going to do that?
It's not worth it
being with you.
Your hands
are cold, too.
There. There.
Now, there
is your monster.
Now, there
is your monster.
Well, I'll be!
Ahh!
Ahh!
Mr. Carface, can i
go outside today?
Sure you can,
little girl,
But first
you talk to the rat.
Well, if you want
my opinion, boss,
I think mighty morris
is going to win the race.
Oh, boss! That cigar!
Hi, Mr. Longtail.
How are you today?
Fine, thank you.
Will you be
in the race tonight?
A sore foot?
You shouldn't run.
And twizzle
has a cold?
She should
drink soup.
Oh, squad car
has the flu.
Hurry it up.
Hurry it up!
I'm sorry.
So who do you
think will win?
Oh, I see.
The spotted gray.
Killer!
Uh-Huh.
Shift the odds
on the spotted gray
And feed the kid.
Oh, boss,
do I have to?
Oh, boy. Where did you
buy that thing?
But, Mr. Carface, you said
i could go outside today.
Charlie?
A little girl
who talks to animals.
Imagine that.
Boss,
i think we--
Don't.
I'll do the thinking.
But, boss!
Poor child.
We'll kidnap her.
Kidnap?
Uh, rescue her.
But, boss--
Itchy, button it up.
Uh, little girl!
Excuse me.
We understand you're being
held here against your will.
Let me introduce
myself. Sit.
I am
Charlie b. Barkin,
And this is my associate,
itchiford "itchy" dachshund.
How do you do?
And it strikes me that
this is not the place for you.
Am I right?
Oh, well...
let us take you
away from all this.
Where are your parents?
I'm an orphan.
Ahh! She's an orphan.
She doesn't have any parents.
That settles it.
You're going to
stay with itchy.
What's your name?
No, no, boss.
She can't
stay with me.
This has gone
too far.
I'm gettin'
outta here.
You have no compassion.
Uhh!
Stay with me.
Anne-Marie.
Huh?
You asked my name.
It's Anne-Marie.
Listen, you'd like living
with me, wouldn't you?
You're going to
love my place--
Canopy bed under the stars,
open hearth,
3 square meals a day,
radio, heater, whitewalls.
I live in a cab.
Low mileage, of course.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hm hm hm!
What?!
Aah!
What do you mean
she is gone?!
Well, you see,
boss, i--
Shut up!
Can't you just--
I--Oof!
Wah!
Morons!
I'm surrounded
by morons!
Aah!
But, boss,
it wasn't my fault.
To be perfectly
honest, you see,
I--Uh--B-B--
Thunder was on duty.
Take it up with him.
Thunder was on duty.
Take it up with him.
I love that girl!
I want her back!
Now!
Boss, you see,
the thing of it--
Now!
Oh ho! Mm hmm!
Oh...
oh...
robin hood says
to little john,
"This sheriff
is a bimbo.
"Let's knock him off
and take the gold.
"We'll give it to
the poor suckers
Who got took
in the first place."
Where do you
get that stuff?
What kind of hood
gives dough to the poor
Without taking his cut?
I like this story,
Mr. Itchy.
You would.
Shut up!
I'm trying to
get the brat to sleep.
Then what happens?
Well, then, uh...
uh...
give me that.
All the poor people
was happy
'Cause they wasn't
poor now.
But this hood guy's
out 50%.
So what?
His doll loved him
all the more.
Was she pretty?
Ha ha!
She was to die for!
Ah!
Ah!
But the whole gang
wondered,
Would maid Marian
marry him?
And...
she did. Ha!
Now go to sleep, huh?
Mr. Itchy and I got to
talk some business.
Boss, let's get something
straight about the kid.
Good night, Mr. Itchy!
Good night, kid!
I don't like this.
We're reading fairy tales
to a little time bomb
Like she was bo peep
and--Ohh!
We could stash her
at the old church.
Ha ha!
Would you relax?
Carface ain't gonna
look for her here.
He thinks I'm dead,
remember?
Now, get some sleep,
pal.
Tomorrow we take
this little time bomb
To the horse track,
And we make
ourselves a fortune!
Horsies?
Ha ha ha!
Now look
what you've done!
8:00.
Ok, boss, 8:00.
I'll be there.
Ok, boss, 8:00.
I'll be there.
Here.
Now go to sleep, huh?
Charlie, would you
please tuck me in?
Please?
Ha. Yeah.
Charlie,
May I please have
a goodnight kiss?
What?
Oh...sure.
Yuck! Blech! Yuck!
Thank you
for rescuing me.
Ah. Ha ha. Sure.
It was--
It was nothing, kid.
Hey, squeaker,
knock it off.
I'm sorry.
Ohwahh!
Charlie, your front seat
hurts me.
Oh, yeah? Ahem.
All right.
All right.
All right.
Dames.
Thank you, Charlie.
Uh-Huh.
Now, uh,
go to sleep, huh?
Dear god...
oh, no!
Thank you so much
For my new best friend
Charlie.
Oh!
And thank you for
sending him to rescue me.
Psst! Hey!
God bless Mr. Itchy...
yeah, bless itchy.
And god bless Charlie.
Amen.
Oh, and please help me
find a mommy and daddy.
Uh!
Whoo!
Charlie?
What?
Do you think
you could help me
Find a mommy and daddy?
Kid,
I'll help you find
The lost city
of Atlantis!
Just please, please
go to sleep!
Charlie?
What?
I have to go
to the bathroom.
Ha ha.
Of course.
Anne-Marie, cupcake,
sweetheart.
Please, just talk
to the horsie, huh?
Talk to Mr. Horsie.
Boss, maybe she only
talks to rats.
She talked to me,
didn't she?
That makes you a rat!
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!
Maybe horses
is too stupid to talk.
Aha!
What did she say?
Hey, listen,
try that again, you,
And you are glue!
What did she say?
You sound just
like Mr. Carface.
What?
He's a criminal.
D-D-D-Did he
read you stories?
Did he give you
a comfortable bed?
Did he
kiss you good night?
I rescued you.
Besides, we're giving
the money to the poor.
Boss!
Sharing it
with the poor.
Like robin hood?
Like the story.
Just like in the story.
And another thing,
if you're serious
About this mommy
and daddy business,
You're going to need
dough of your own,
New dresses, new shoes.
I know these things.
Nobody wants a scrawny
little doll in rags.
Promise you'll help me
find a mommy and daddy?
I promise.
Oh, Charlie!
Good shape
for a little kid.
Isn't that wonderful?
Don't pick me up.
Put me down.
Excuse me.
Could you tell me
which one of you
Is going to win
today's race?
We'll give the money
to the poor
And buy me a new dress
so I can get some parents.
Who?
Oh, how nice.
Well, what is it?
It's the grand chawhee's
birthday.
Chee haw who?
Huh? Cha who?
Chee. Chee haw.
No. Chawhee!
It's his birthday.
Who do you think

It's a surprise.
I'll say!
Can we trust
this horse?
Ok, ok!
The grand Chawhee,

Let's go

A couple, a couple--
Mmm! Yeah!
A mom and dad!
Yeah, right.

Nope! Too thin!
Too fat.
Hee hee hee!
Oh, look! Charlie!
They're perfect!
You know, kid,

Wait right here.

Pleased to meet you.

Where are

Squeaker,

But I want to talk--
We'll miss chawhee's

Last call for bets.

Thank you.
Are you getting any of that

Ooh! It's ju--

Mostly the back

But other than that...

Yoo-Hoo!

Excuse me.

Hello, Stella!
Jolly good day

Oh, yes,

I do hate to rain

But did you know

Oh, really?
You don't--
Oh.
Terribly sorry.
Ha ha ha ha!
He did it!

Happy birthday!
Ha ha ha ha!
Arr! Yuck!
Go! Go!
Ha ha ha ha!
Hee hee hee!
Ahem!
Smiley, what do you know?
What do you say?
That's using your head.
Ha! Enjoy!
Hey, itch!
The place looks great!
Ha ha ha!
Hey!
What is this?
What are you doing?
I'm leaving!
You said we would
help the poor,
And we didn't.
You promised to
find me parents.
You didn't even look.
All you do is gamble.
It isn't right!
You know something,
you're right.
What a selfish, callous cad
of a heel I've been,
Blind to the needs of
our society's lonely unloved.
Thank you.
Thank you for helping me
see the light.
Squeaker, we're going to
help the poor.
Oh, Charlie!
Yuck! Blech!
What is it with you
and this kid?
We got a business to run.
We got to keep the
little kid happy, right?
Blech! Blah!
I knew we should have
used the pliers!
Charlie's alive,
And I know
he's got the girl!
Killer,
this is strike 2.
You're out.
Wait, boss! I get
one more strike!
Lower him!
Oh!
Nothing personal,
killer. Business.
Umm! Umm!
If you want
something done right,
You got to
do it yourself.
Ooh.
How do I handle
Charlie?
Knives?
Boss!
Poison?
Car didn't work.
Something.
Something very special.
Boss!
Pull me up, please!
I got a gun!
A gun?
What kind of gun?
Boss, you hear me?
I got a gun!
Stop, fishies! Stop!
I don't taste
that good!
Boss! Pull me up!
I got--I got a--
I got a--Ow! Ow!
A flash Gordon
thermo-Atomic ray gun, boss.
A ray gun!
Heh heh heh heh heh!
Ha ha ha ha ha!
Who does his evil deeds
in the shadowed dark of night?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
The phantom does!
Uhh!
These are some of
the poorest people
I know.

Was it a monster?
Did it bite?
Oh, boy. It was...
it was only a dream.
Anne-Marie?
Anne-Marie?
Anne-Marie!
Where is that kid?
She went to
402 Maple street
To see
the wallet family.
What?!
What?
Great.
You like waffles?
Oh, yes.
Very much, thank you.
No, thank you.
This is the most beautiful
house I've ever seen.
Thank you,
Anne-Marie.
Where do you live?
I live with Charlie.
He's my dog.
Oh. But what about
your parents?
I don't have
any parents.
Then where
do you stay?
With Charlie
in the junkyard.
Anne-Marie,
you sit right there.
Honey, come with me.
We can't let her
leave here
With nowhere to go.
I know, honey.
Hey! Hey! Pssst!
Come here.
Psst!
Oh, Charlie,
Harold and Kate are
really wonderful.
They weren't upset
about the wallet.
They gave me real waffles
with butter and syrup.
Really? That's great.
Look, uh,
I'm glad to see...
you found a home
for yourself.
Oh, do you think so?
Sure, sure.
In fact, uh, i, uh,
i just came over
To...say good-bye.
Good-Bye?
Yeah. I guess
you won't be
Needing me anymore.
Maybe you could stay, too.
No, I couldn't stay.
I mean, I don't want
to spoil it for you.
They don't want
a dirty old dog like me
In a nice, clean house
like--Like this.
But, Charlie...
don't worry about me.
I--I'll make out...
somehow.
Oh...
by the way,
You were the best friend
I...I ever had.
Enjoy your waffles.
Charlie?
Charlie, wait!
Charlie, wait!
All right. A little
more to the left.
I don't want to
hit the girl.
Steady.
Hold it, hold it.
And...
good-bye, Charlie.
Good-Bye, Charlie.
<b>Anne-Marie: </b><i>(screaming, in horror) </i>Oh, no! Charlie!
<b>Carface: </b>Got him!
Charlie! Charlie!
Oh, you beautiful

How--How do you
S-S-Stop this thing?
You ok, squeaker?
Oh, Charlie,
i thought they shot you.
So did i.
Mr. Carface doesn't know
who he's dealing with.
I got a power of my own,
And I'm gonna take care
of him right now.
And there ain't nothin' or
nobody that's gonna stop me!
Charlie.
Walk...walk softly.
Walk softly!
Yeoooww!
Aaaah!
My watch!
Where's my watch?
Where are we?
I don't know.
We got to find
that watch.
Maybe it's
in the water.
What?! No!
No!
Listen, listen!
Oh, no!
No! It stopped!
Good-Bye.
Good-Bye, Anne-Marie.
Good-Bye?
Charlie,
where you going?
Charlie!
There it is.
What's going on here?
Gads, we're haunted.
Charlie!
Aah!
What did they say?
Tell them to give me
back my watch.
I can't, Charlie.
They talk funny.
I don't care!
Got it!
Uh-Oh!
Oh!
Oh, no!
Charlie, what's that
moving in the water?
I don't know.
Squeaker!
We're going to die.
Oh!
Please! My watch!
Please! My watch!
Ahh! You look like
A tasty New Orleans
canine gumbo!
No! Don't eat him,
please!
Ahh!
How can you expect me
To eat a voice
as sumptuous as this?
a dulcet tone like that #
a big thrill #
<b>Charlie:</b> Aah!
Ha ha ha!
Oh, what do you call
that voice, little fella?
That a baritone
or a tenor?
It's, uh...

This is

Yo! Charlie!
<i>(Then Itchy notices Anne-Marie had heard the whole conversation, and she starts crying)</i>
Ah!
Anne-Marie!

Aaah!

She has friends there.
They'll know what to do.
And hurry!

402 Maple street?
Would ya just tell me

Charlie's in trouble,
And there's a little girl
real sick.
402 Maple's over
by the firehouse.
Thanks.
What was that
all about?
Charlie's in trouble.
A little girl may die.
Well, tarnation!
Anne-Marie.

It reminds me
Of when lassie

So you see, Charlie,
This story has
a happy ending.
I keep the girl
and make a fortune,
And you...

the tears we've cried #
beyond our lives #
growing stronger #
the tears we've cried #
