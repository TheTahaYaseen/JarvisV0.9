<b>ANT:</b> No, no, no. Oh, no. Oh, no.
<b>ANT:</b> I'm lost! Where's the line? It just went away. What do I do?
<b>ANT:</b> Help! 
<b>ANT:</b> We'll be stuck here forever!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Do not panic! Do not panic! We are trained professionals! Now, stay calm. We are going around the leaf.
<b>ANT:</b> A-Around the leaf? I-I don't think we can do that.
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Oh, nonsense. This is nothing compared to the twig of '93.
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> That's it. That's it. Good! You're doing great! There you go. There you go!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Watch my eyes. Don't look away. And here's the line again.
<b>ANT:</b> (gleeful shout) Thank you! Thank you, Mr. Soil!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Good job, everybody!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Oh, my. There's quite a gap, Mr. Soil. Shouldn't we tell the queen?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> I don't think we need to involve the queen in this. She's got enough on her plate already, training her daughter.
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Oh, yes, Princess Atta. The poor dear.
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh... Wind's died down. They'll be here soon.
<b>QUEEN:</b> Just be confident, dear. You'll be fine.
<b>ATTA:</b> Ah! There's a gap. There's a gap in the line! What are we gonna do?!
<b>THORNY:</b> It's okay, Your Highness. Gaps happen. We just lost a few inches, that's all.
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh, right.
<b>THORNY:</b> Your Highness, I can't count when you hover like that.
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh, of course. I'm sorry. (chuckle) Go ahead.
<b>QUEEN:</b> Guys, go shade someone else for a while. Okay, Atta. Now what do we do?
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh! Don't tell me. I know it. I know it. What is it?
<b>QUEEN:</b> We relax!
<b>ATTA:</b> Right.
<b>QUEEN:</b> Oh, it'll be fine. It's the same, year after year. They come, they eat, they leave. That's our lot in life. It's not a lot, but it's our life. (laughs) Isn't that right, Aphie? Oh, you're such a cute little aphid.
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Ditch Dot!
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Yeah, yeah!
<b>DOT:</b> Hey, come back here!
<b>DOT:</b> (grunts)
<b>QUEEN:</b> Dot!
<b>DOT:</b> Yes, Mother.
<b>QUEEN:</b> What did I tell you about trying to fly?
<b>DOT:</b> Not until my wings grow in.
<b>QUEEN:</b> Right.
<b>DOT:</b> But, Mom--
<b>ATTA:</b> Dot, you're a young queen ant, and your wings are too little to be--
<b>DOT:</b> I was talking to Mother. You're not the queen yet, Atta.
<b>QUEEN:</b> Now, Dot, be nice to your sister.
<b>DOT:</b> It's not my fault she's so stressed out.
<b>ATTA:</b> (sigh) I know, I know. (sigh) I'm always acting like the sky is falling.
<b>DR. SOIL:</b> Look out!
<b>ATTA:</b> Ah!
<b>QUEEN:</b> Atta!
<b>THORNY:</b> Princess Atta!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Princess Atta! Princess Atta!
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Look out!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Hey! Stop that!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> What do you think you're doing?
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> You could have killed somebody over here!
<b>FLIK:</b> (gasp) I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
<b>THORNY:</b> Oh, it's Flik.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> (groan)
<b>FLIK:</b> I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! Please forgive me. I'm sorry! 
<b>FLIK:</b> (scream) Princess Atta!
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, what are you doing?
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh... Oh, this! This is my new idea for harvesting grain. No more picking individual kernels. You can just cut down the entire stalk!
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, we don't have time for this.
<b>FLIK:</b> Exactly! We never have time to collect food for ourselves, because we spend all summer harvesting for the offering. But my invention will speed up production.
<b>ATTA:</b> (groan) Another invention?
<b>FLIK:</b> Yeah, and I've got something for you, too.
<b>ATTA:</b> (sigh) Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Since you're gonna be queen soon, you could use this to oversee production. Dr. Flora, if I may.
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> (gasp) Oh!
<b>ATTA:</b> This is all very nice, but--
<b>THORNY:</b> What?
<b>FLIK:</b> Just an ordinary blade of grass and a bead of dew, right?
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, please.
<b>FLIK:</b> Wrong! It is, in fact...
<i>[Flik rolls up the blade of grass and places the bead of dew in its center.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> ...A telescope!
<b>QUEEN &amp; DOT:</b> (laughing)
<b>ATTA:</b> It's very clever, Flik, but--
<i>[Flik peers at Atta through the telescope.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Hello, princess! My, aren't you looking lovely this morning! Not, of course, that you would need a telescope to see that--
<b>THORNY:</b> All right, listen! The princess doesn't have time for this! You want to help us fill this thing? Then get rid of that machine, get back in line and pick grain like everybody else!
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Like everybody else!
<b>ATTA:</b> Please, Flik. Just go.
<b>FLIK:</b> I'm sorry. I was-- I was really just trying... Trying to help.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Harvester. Why, we've harvested the same way ever since I was a pupa.
<b>ATTA:</b> (exasperated sigh) Where were we?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> The food pile, Your Highness.
<b>ATTA:</b> Oh, yes. Yes.
<b>DOT:</b> Hey, Flik! Flik, wait up!
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh. Hello, princess.
<b>DOT:</b> You can call me Dot. Here, you forgot this.
<i>[Dot holds the telescope out to Flik.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Thanks. You can keep it. I can...make another one.
<b>DOT:</b> I like your inventions.
<b>FLIK:</b> Really? Well, you're the first. I'm beginning to think nothing I do works.
<i>[Dot holds up the telescope.]</i>
<b>DOT:</b> This works.
<b>FLIK:</b> Great. One success. (sigh) I'm never gonna make a difference.
<b>DOT:</b> Me, neither. I'm a royal ant, and I can't even fly yet. I'm too little.
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh, being little's not such a bad thing.
<b>DOT:</b> Yes, it is.
<b>FLIK:</b> No, it's not.
<b>DOT:</b> Is, too!
<b>FLIK:</b> Is not.
<b>DOT:</b> Is, too.
<b>FLIK:</b> Is not. Is not. Is not.
<b>DOT:</b> Is, too. Is, too. Is, too.
<b>FLIK:</b> Is not-- Oh... A seed. I need-- I need a seed. Uh... (grunts)
<i>[Flik spins around as he tries to take a seed from his harvester.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (groan) Uh, here, here.
<i>[Flik picks up a rock off the ground.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Pretend-- Pretend that that's a seed.
<b>DOT:</b> It's a rock.
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh, I know it's a rock. I know. Uh, but let's just pretend for a minute that it's a seed, all right? We'll just use our imaginations. Now-Now do you see our tree? Everything that made that giant tree is already contained inside this tiny little seed. All it needs is some time, a little bit of sunshine and rain, and voila!
<b>DOT:</b> This rock will be a tree?
<b>FLIK:</b> Seed to tree. You've got to work with me, here, all right? Okay. Now, you might not feel like you can do much now, but that's just because, well, you're not a tree yet. You just have to give yourself some time. You're still a seed.
<b>DOT:</b> But it's a rock.
<b>FLIK:</b> I know it's a rock! Don't you think I know a rock when I see a rock? I've spent a lot of time around rocks!
<b>DOT:</b> (laughing) You're weird, but I like you.
<b>FLIK:</b> (gasp) They're here.
<b>ANTS:</b> They're here!
<b>ANT:</b> Run!
<b>DOT:</b> Mom! Where are you?
<b>ANTS:</b> They're coming! Run!
<b>QUEEN:</b> Dot! Dot!
<b>DOT:</b> Mom! Mom!
<b>ATTA:</b> Single file!
<b>QUEEN:</b> Thank heavens!
<b>ATTA:</b> Please, everyone. Uh, food to the offering stone.
<b>QUEEN:</b> (whistle) Okay, everyone, single file. Food to the offering stone and into the anthill. Now let's go!
<b>ANT:</b> Go, go, go, go!
<b>ATTA:</b> Come on! Keep moving, keep moving! Good!
<b>ATTA:</b> Okay. That's everyone.
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey! Hey, wait for me!
<i>[Flik runs to the offering stone.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Get the food to the offering stone, then into the anthill.
<i>[Flik takes off his still-running harvester and throws it onto the altar. The harvester falls off and springs open, knocking out a supporting stone and causing the structure to start collapsing.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Huh?
<i>[The food atop the offering stone begins falling off the edge of the island.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (scream) Ah! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! 
<i>[Flik grabs onto the leaf beneath the food as it continues tumbling down.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> No! Oh! Oh! (grunts)
<i>[The last of the food falls into the water below.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh, no...
<i>[Flik runs to the anthill.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Princess Atta! Princess Atta! Princess Attaaaa!
<i>[The droning of grasshoppers is heard as the ants cower inside the anthill.]</i>
<b>ATTA:</b> (whispering) They come, they eat, they leave. They come, they eat, they leave.
<b>FLIK:</b> Excuse me. 'Scuse me, pardon me. Pardon me. Excuse me, coming through. 'Scuse me, 'scuse me. Sorry, sorry. Coming through. Princess Atta, there's something I need to tell you.
<b>ATTA:</b> Not now, Flik.
<b>FLIK:</b> (whispering) But, Your Highness, it's about the offering!
<b>ATTA:</b> Shh!
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Hey, what's goin' on?
<b>MOLT:</b> Yeah! Where's the food?
<b>ATTA:</b> (whispers) What did you do?
<i>[The colony turns toward Flik.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> It was an accident?
<i>[Grasshopper legs punch holes through the ceiling and they crawl inside, landing among the ants.]</i>
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> (cackling)
<b>GRASSHOPPERS:</b> (whooping)
<b>MOLT:</b> Boo! (laugh) Where's the food?
<i>[Flik and two ants attempt to crawl away when a large set of legs belonging to the grasshopper leader, Hopper, land in front of them. Hopper leers down at them.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (shuddering) Hopper.
<i>[Hopper steps over Flik and walks slowly among the ants, eventually coming to a stop.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> So where is it?
<i>[Hopper turns around.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> Where's my food?!
<b>ATTA:</b> Uh... I-Isn't it up...there?
<b>HOPPER:</b> What?
<b>ATTA:</b> The food was in a leaf sitting on top--
<b>HOPPER:</b> Excuse me?
<b>ATTA:</b> Are you sure it's not up there?
<i>[Hopper looms over Atta.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> Are you saying I'm stupid?
<b>ATTA:</b> No.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Do I look...stupid...to you? Let's just think about the logic, shall we? Let's just think about it for a second. If it was up there, would I be coming down here, to your level, looking for it?!
<b>ATTA:</b> I-- 
<b>HOPPER:</b> Why am I even talking to you? You're not the queen. You don't smell like the queen.
<b>QUEEN:</b> She's learning to take over from me, Hopper.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Oh, I see. Under new management. So it's your fault.
<b>ATTA:</b> No, i-it wasn't me. It was--
<b>HOPPER:</b> Uh-uh-uh. First rule of leadership: everything is your fault.
<b>ATTA:</b> But, but I--
<b>HOPPER:</b> It's a bug-eat-bug world out there, Princess. One of those circle-of-life kind of things. Now, let me tell you how things are supposed to work. The sun grows the food. The ants pick the food. The grasshoppers eat the food--
<b>MOLT:</b> And the birds eat the grasshoppers. Hey, like the one that nearly ate you, you 'member? You 'member-- Oh, you should've seen it.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Molt.
<b>MOLT:</b> This blue jay, he has him halfway down his throat, okay? And Hopper, Hopper's kicking and screaming, okay? And I'm scared, okay? I'm not going anywhere near, okay? Oh, come on! It's a great story!
<i>[Hopper grabs Molt and drags him.]</i>
<b>MOLT:</b> Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow-ow--
<i>[Hopper slams Molt into a wall and pins him.]</i>
<b>MOLT:</b> Oof!
<b>HOPPER:</b> I swear, if I hadn't promised Mother on her deathbed that I wouldn't kill you, I would kill you.
<b>MOLT:</b> And believe me, no one appreciates that more than I do.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Shut up! I don't want to hear another word out of you while we're on this island. Do you understand me?
<b>MOLT:</b> (whimper)
<i>[Hopper shakes Molt.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> I said, do you understand me?!
<b>MOLT:</b> Well, how can I answer? You said I couldn't say another word.
<i>[Hopper reels back his fist.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> (growl)
<b>MOLT:</b> Ah! Remember Ma!
<i>[Hopper turns around and punches another grasshopper. The ants and grasshoppers stare at him.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> (panting) Hey, I'm a compassionate insect. There's still a few months 'til the rains come, so you can all just try again.
<b>QUEEN:</b> But, Hopper, since it's almost the rainy season, we need this time to gather food for ourselves.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Listen, if you don't keep your end of the bargain, then I can't guarantee your safety. And there are insects out there that will take advantage of you. Someone could get hurt. (snaps fingers)
<b>DOT:</b> (shivering)
<b>THUMPER:</b> (snarling, roars)
<i>[Two grasshoppers hold a third, pale and fiercely struggling grasshopper, Thumper, by a leash.]</i>
<b>DOT:</b> (gasps, panting, yelps)
<i>[Hopper grabs Dot by the head and lifts her up.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> What's the matter? You scared of grasshoppers?
<i>[Hopper brings Dot toward Thumper.]</i>
<b>DOT:</b> (panicking)
<b>FLIK:</b> Dot!
<b>HOPPER:</b> You don't like Thumper?
<b>DOT:</b> (whimpering)
<b>THUMPER:</b> (snarling)
<i>[Flik steps forward.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Leave her alone!
<i>[Hopper slowly walks over to Flik and holds Dot out to him.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> You want her? Go ahead. Take her.
<b>DOT:</b> (whimpering)
[Flik looks down to the ground.]
<b>HOPPER:</b> No? Then get back in line.
<i>[Flik steps back in among the other ants. Hopper releases Dot who runs back to the queen.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> It seems to me that you ants are forgetting your place. So let's double the order of food.
<b>FLIK:</b> (gasp)
<b>ATTA:</b> No! But, but, but--
<b>HOPPER:</b> We'll be back at the end of the season...
<i>[Hopper tears off a piece of Molt's shedding skin.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> ...When the last...leaf...falls.
<i>[Hopper drops the skin piece which floats down. Atta looks up at the outside tree.]</i>
<b>HOPPER:</b> You ants have a nice summer. Let's ride!
<i>[Hopper flies out through the ceiling, the other grasshoppers joining him.]</i>
<b>GRASSHOPPERS:</b> Yee-haw! (whooping)
<b>MOLT:</b> (laughs, pained grunt)
<i>[Molt hits his head on the ceiling before flying out a hole. After the grasshoppers have left, the colony stares at Flik.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (nervous chuckle)
<i>[Scene cuts to Atta banging a gavel inside a large courtroom.]</i>
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, what do you have to say for yourself?
<b>FLIK:</b> Sorry. I-- I'm sorry for the way I am. I didn't mean for things to go so wrong. I...especially didn't want to make you look bad, Princess.
<b>ATTA:</b> Well, Flik, you did.
<b>FLIK:</b> I was just trying to help.
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Then help us. Don't help us.
<b>FLIK:</b> Help? Help? Help?
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, you are sentenced to one month digging in the tunnels.
<b>THORNY:</b> Uh, excuse me, Your Highness. Need I remind you of Flik's tunnel-within-a-tunnel project?
<b>FLIK:</b> Helpers to help us. That could-- That's it! We could...
<b>THORNY:</b> It took the whole engineering department two days to dig him out. Send him to Health and Ant Services.
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Heavens, no!
<b>FLIK:</b> We could leave the island. The riverbed's dry right now. We could just walk right across the riverbed. We could go get helpers. We could! We could leave, sure. We could go find helpers to help us. It's perfect!
<b>QUEEN:</b> Perfect? What's so perfect?
<b>FLIK:</b> Your Highness, don't you see? We could send someone to get help!
<b>ANT COUNCIL:</b> (gasps)
<b>ATTA:</b> Leave the island?
<b>QUEEN:</b> Now, why didn't I think of that? Oh! Because it's suicide!
<b>THORNY:</b> She's right! We never leave the island!
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Never leave!
<b>THORNY:</b> There's snakes and birds and bigger bugs out there!
<b>FLIK:</b> Exactly! Bigger bugs! We could find bigger bugs to come here and fight and forever rid us of Hopper and his gang!
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Ludicrous!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Who would do a crazy thing like that?
<b>FLIK:</b> I'll volunteer. I'd be very happy to volunteer.
<b>QUEEN:</b> (laughs) You got a lot of spunk, kid, but no one's gonna help a bunch of ants.
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> At least we could try. Oh, I-I could-- I could travel to the city. I could search there!
<b>ATTA:</b> If you went, you'd be on that silly search for weeks.
<b>THORNY:</b> Royal huddle.
<b>THORNY:</b> (whispering) Great idea, princess. It's perfect.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Exactly.
<b>ATTA:</b> Wait a minute. What did we just decide here?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> To let Flik leave.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> While we keep harvesting to meet Hopper's demands.
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> You see? With Flik gone, he can't --
<b>ATTA:</b> He can't mess anything up!
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik, after much deliberation, we have decided...to grant you your request.
<b>FLIK:</b> Really?
<b>QUEEN:</b> Really?
<b>ATTA:</b> Uh, really.
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh! Thank you, princess. Thank you so much for this chance. I-I-I won't let you down, I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise.
<b>ATTA:</b> Yeah, yeah, that's fine, that's fine. No, forget it, forget it.
<b>FLIK:</b> But I should probably help repair some of the damage before I go, don't you think--
<b>ANT COUNCIL:</b> No! No, no!
<b>ATTA:</b> Just go. Just go.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Just leave!
<b>FLIK:</b> (suavely) Hey.
<b>FLIK:</b> Don't worry! The colony is in good hands! Bye, now.
<b>ANTS:</b> (cheering)
<b>FLIK:</b> (breathes in) All right.
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey, fellas. Beautiful morning, huh?
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> My dad says he gives you one hour before you come back to the island crying.
<b>FLIK:</b> Does he, now?
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> My dad doesn't think that.
<b>FLIK:</b> He doesn't, huh?
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Nah, he's bettin' you're gonna die. 
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh.
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Yeah, he says if the heat doesn't get you, the birds will.
<b>DOT:</b> Well, I think he's gonna make it.
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Nobody asked you, Your Royal Shortness.
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Yeah, Dot. What do you know?
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey, hey, hey. Ease up, all right? Come on. She's entitled to her opinion, too. Ohh...
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> So go, already.
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Hey!
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> The city's that way!
<b>FLIK:</b> I know.
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> You're supposed to look for bugs, not dandelions!
<b>DOT:</b> You leave him alone. He knows what he's doing.
<b>FLIK:</b> That's right! Here I go! For the colony and for oppressed ants everywhere!
<b>FLIK:</b> Whoa...
<b>DOT:</b> Wow!
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey!
<b>DOT:</b> Bye, Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Wow. Whoa!
<b>DOT:</b> Good luck, Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Bye! (pained grunt)
<b>DOT:</b> Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> (muffled) I'm okay!
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Your dad's right. He's gonna die.
<b>DOT:</b> You just watch. He's gonna get the bestest, roughest bugs you've ever seen!
<b>DIM:</b> (roaring)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Get back! Get back! Get back, you horrible beast! I have no fear!
<b>DIM:</b> Oh! (whimpers)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Oh, my goodness.
<b>DIM:</b> (crying)
<b>FLIES:</b> (booing)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Oh, I'm so sorry, Dim.
<b>DIM:</b> Owie! Owie, owie! (sobs)
<b>ROSIE:</b> An owie? Okay, show Rosie the owie. All right, Dim. It's okay.
<b>FLY MOM:</b> (frustrated sigh) I have been in outhouses that didn't stink that bad. This is ridiculous. What a disappointment.
[A small flea in a top hat, P.T. Flea, jumps outside the tent.]
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> (gasp) No!
<b>FLY:</b> You! Come here! I want my money back!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Uh, no refunds after the first two minutes.
<b>ROACH:</b> Popcorn! Stale popcorn!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> We're losin' the audience! You clowns get out there now!
<i>[A ladybug, Francis, and a large caterpillar, Heimlich, head toward the stage.]</i>
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> (groan) I hate performing on an empty stomach!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Do your act, Heimlich. Then you can eat.
<i>[A walking stick, Slim, stands before P.T. Flea.]</i>
<b>SLIM:</b> P.T., what's the point?
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Not now, Slim.
<b>SLIM:</b> What's the point of going out there? They'll only laugh at me.
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> That's because you're a clown!
<b>SLIM:</b> No, it's because I'm a prop! You always cast me as the broom, the pole, the stick!
<i>[Slim grabs P.T. Flea.]</i>
<b>SLIM:</b> A splinter!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> You're a walking stick. It's funny! Now go!
<b>SLIM:</b> You parasite.
<b>FLIES:</b> (booing)
<i>[Slim and Francis prance in the arena with flowers on their heads.]</i>
<b>SLIM:</b> Tra-la-la-la-la. Spring is in the air. And I'm a flower with nothing interesting to say.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> (high-pitched) Ah!
<b>SLIM:</b> A bee!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> I am a cute little bumblebee!
<i>[Heimlich begins chasing Slim and Francis around the arena.]</i>
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Here I come!
<b>SLIM &amp; FRANCIS:</b> (dramatically screaming)
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> (panting) Slow down, you flowers!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Oh! Candy corn! (pants) Here. Let me help you to finish it.
<b>FLY:</b> Hey, cutie! Wanna pollinate with a real bug? (laughing raucously) Ooh! Come to Papa, yeah!
<b>FRANCIS:</b> So! Being a ladybug automatically makes me a girl! Is that it, fly boy?! Huh?!
<b>FLY:</b> Yikes! She's a guy!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Francis, leave them alone. They are poo-poo heads!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Not again.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Judging by your breath, you must have been buzzin' around a dung heap all day!
<b>SLIM:</b> Come on, Francis. You're making the maggots cry.
<b>MAGGOTS:</b> (wailing)
<i>[Large wings with eye spots fan out. They belong to a moth, Gypsy, who preens and warms up her voice in a dressing room.]</i>
<b>GYPSY:</b> (operatic vocalizing)
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> All right, we're dying out there. Gypsy, quick, you and Manny--
<b>GYPSY:</b> Shh. He's in a trance.
<i>[A praying mantis, Manny, is shown in the room rubbing his temples with his eyes closed.]</i>
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Well, get him out of it! You and your husband are up now!
<b>GYPSY:</b> Manny, we're on.
<b>MANNY:</b> Oh? Yet again it is up to me to rescue the performance. Gypsy, come.
<b>GYPSY:</b> (humming)
<b>MANNY:</b> (crashes, groans)
<b>GYPSY:</b> Stage is the other way, dear.
<b>MANNY:</b> Yes, of course.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Anytime, pal! I'm gonna pick the hairs out of your head one by one!
<b>FLY:</b> Take your best shot!
<b>FRANCIS:</b> You name the place!
<b>FLY:</b> Oh, yeah?
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Yeah, 'cause when you get there, you are dead!
<b>SLIM:</b> Francis, let me handle this. That's no way to speak to a lady.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> I heard that, you twig!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present Manto the Magnificent and his lovely assistant, Gypsy!
<i>[P.T. Flea sounds the gong.]</i>
<b>MANNY:</b> From the most mysterious regions of uncharted Asia, I give you the Chinese Cabinet of Metamorphosis!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Rosie, whole troupe! On stage! Finale! Now!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Okay, I just need a little time to--
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Now!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Coming. Coming. Tuck, Roll. Let's get moving, guys. We're up next.
<i>[Two pillbugs, Tuck with separate eyebrows and Roll with a unibrow, roll in.]</i>
<b>TUCK &amp; ROLL:</b> (speaking foreign language)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Don't you understand? We are up!
<b>TUCK &amp; ROLL:</b> Up-a! Up-a! (speaking foreign language)
<i>[Tuck jumps onto Roll's shoulders.]</i>
<b>TUCK &amp; ROLL:</b> Hey!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Hey! They don't understand me.
<b>MANNY:</b> I summon the voice of Confucius...
<b>FLY:</b> Get off the stage, you old hack!
<b>MANNY:</b> (yelps) I demand to know who said that! (grunts)
<i>[A piece of fruit hits Manny.]</i>
<b>MANNY:</b> How dare you! (yelps)
<i>[More fruit hits Manny.]</i>
<b>FLIES:</b> (booing)
<b>MANNY:</b> Ingrates!
<i>[Fruit continues to hit Manny as he walks offstage. Gypsy remains inside the food container.]</i>
<b>GYPSY:</b> (muffled) Manny? Manny!
<b>FLY:</b> I only got 24 hours to live, and I ain't gonna waste it here! Come on!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> (screams)
<i>[P.T. Flea runs to a matchbox and takes a match.]</i>
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> I've just about had it with these losers!
<i>[P.T. Flea runs into the ring and holds the match up.]</i>
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Flaming death!
<i>[The leaving flies stop to look.]</i>
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> I hold in my hand...the match! The match that decides whether two bugs live or die this very evening.
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> In a moment, I will light this trail of matches, leading to a sheet of flypaper doused in lighter fluid! Aimed directly at the flypaper are Tuck and Roll, the pill-bug cannonballs! The cannon will be triggered by Dim, trained to jump at the sound of this bell, set to go off in 15 seconds.
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Our pill bugs' only hope of survival is our mistress of the high wire, Rosie! Secured to a web line of exact length, Rosie will plummet down to these two posts, spinning a web of safety in less than 15 seconds!
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Not good enough, you say? Well, what if they were all blindfolded?
<i>[The flies hurry back to their seats.]</i>
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> Ladies and gentlemen, may I suggest that those of you with weak constitutions leave the arena, for this act is so dangerous that if the slightest thing should go wrong...
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> No!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Go? Whoa! Okay, through the tunnel...
<b>GYPSY:</b> Whoa!
[Gypsy falls onto the timer, causing it to ding and signalling Dim to jump.]
<b>DIM:</b> (laughs)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Okay, that's done!

<b>FRANCIS:</b> Water! We need some water!
<b>SLIM:</b> Water, water, water, water!
<b>FLIES:</b> (laughing)
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> (panicking) Help! (grunting) Get me out of here!

<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> (laughs triumphantly)
<i>[As P.T. Flea walks away, the flypaper falls on top of him and is ignited by the flame.]</i>
<b>FLY:</b> Wow!
<i>[The flypaper burns away, leaving behind a charred P.T. Flea standing midstep.]</i>
<b>ROSIE:</b> It's the-the web. I'm sorry. It's--
<b>P.T. FLEA:</b> You're all fired.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> We got the water!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Here we come, P.T.!
<b>SLIM:</b> We'll save you!

<b>FLIK:</b> (impressed laugh)
<b>BEETLE CAB:</b> Makin' all stops to the septic tank, including standing water, empty bean can and dead rat. Watch your stingers. All aboard!

<b>FLIK:</b> Oh, sorry.
<b>SNAIL:</b> Ow! Watch where you're goin'!
<b>FLIK:</b> I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that. I didn't-- Oh, sorry!

<b>FLIK:</b> Oh. I'm really, really sorry. That was an... An accident.

<b>BUG:</b> I've been working out. Feel my wing.

<b>BEETLE WAITRESS:</b> Hey, who ordered the poo-poo platter?
<b>MOSQUITO WAITER:</b> Here you go, slick. Enjoy.
<b>SLUG:</b> Ow-Oww! Hey, I said no salt!
<b>BUG:</b> Buzz off!
<b>FLIK:</b> Pardon me, sir, I was wondering if I could talk to you for a moment. I represent a colony, uh, of ants, and I'm looking for tough bugs, you know, mean bugs, the sort of bugs...
<b>SLIM:</b> Fired by a flea! How humiliating!
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Let's face it. We stink.

<b>FLY:</b> Hello there, girlie bug.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Shoo, fly. Don't bother me.
<b>FLY:</b> Say, why don't you tell our pal, Thud...
<i>[Thud slams down behind Francis.]</i>
<b>THUD:</b> (growl)
<b>FLY:</b> ...What you said to us at the circus?

<b>MOSQUITO:</b> Hey, bartender! Bloody Mary, O-positive.
<b>FLIK:</b> Sir?
<b>FLIES:</b> Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home! (laughing)
<b>FLY:</b> Not so tough now, are you? All right, clown. Get up and fight like a girl.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> (whispers) Get ready to do the Robin Hood act.
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> (giggles) I want to be Little John!
<b>SLIM:</b> What part can I play?
<b>FLIK:</b> I'm looking for tough warrior bugs.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Stand back, ye flies! We are the greatest warriors in all bugdom!

<b>GYPSY:</b> (gasp) A talent scout.
<b>FLIK:</b> My colony's in trouble. Grasshoppers are coming! We've been forced to prepare all this food.

<i>[Flik and the troupe fly over a grassy field.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> So you see, it was my fault that Hopper's coming back. But then, Princess Atta... Boy, is she one in a million. She let me go out and find you. And after seeing you fight off those flies... Boy, are those grasshoppers in for a big surprise! (LAUGHING TRIUMPHANTLY)
<b>TUCK:</b> (asks question in foreign language)
<i>[Roll shrugs.]</i>
<b>ANT:</b> (moans)
<b>ATTA:</b> Dr. Flora!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> Oh, dear. Not another one.
<b>THORNY:</b> This is insane.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Insane.
<b>THORNY:</b> There's just not enough food left on the island! No way we can make double quota before Hopper comes!
<b>ATTA:</b> Well, we have to try, Thorny. We don't have any choice.
<b>THORNY:</b> Yeah. I know.
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Hey, look who's playing lookout again. Little Speck!
<b>DOT:</b> The name is Dot.
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Well, Spot, you still looking for Flik?
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Forget it, Dot. That loser's never coming back.
<b>DOT:</b> Flik! He did it! He did it!
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> What?
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> Quit shoving!
<b>FLIK:</b> This is it! This is Ant Island!
<b>DOT:</b> Flik! Over here! Flik! Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey!
<b>DOT:</b> He did it! He did it! Yay! He did it! He did it!
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> Cool!
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY &amp; BLUE ANT BOY:</b> (yelp)
<b>THORNY:</b> At the rate these leaves are dropping, we're gonna need a miracle.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> That's right! We need a miracle!
<i>[The troupe begins descending with a droning buzz.]</i>
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Run for your lives!
<i>[The troupe lands and strikes a pose.]</i>
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Ta-da!
(BIRD CAWING IN DISTANCE)
<b>MANNY:</b> (sighs) Once again, our reputation precedes us.
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey, everybody! Hey! I'm back!
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey, guys! Hey! Look. Look!
<b>FLIK:</b> Look who's here with me!
<b>DOT:</b> Flik! Flik! Flik! You're back!
<b>DOT:</b> I knew you could do it!
<b>ANT 1:</b> Flik?
<b>ANT 2:</b> It's Flik!
<b>ANT 3:</b> What?
<b>ANT 4:</b> Yeah.
<b>ANT 3:</b> No, it's not Flik.
<b>ANT 5:</b> Flik?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Flik has returned!
<b>ATTA:</b> He's back?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> And he's accompanied by savage insects!
<b>ATTA:</b> What? How? He wasn't supposed to actually find someone!
Oh, look at this. Look at this. This is great. Look.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Oh, my ticker!
<b>BLUE ANT BOY:</b> So, what are you supposed to be?
<b>VIOLET ANT BOY:</b> He's a stick, stupid. You hit bugs with him.
<b>SLIM:</b> That's an oversimplification.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> That's right, kids. Like this!
<b>SLIM:</b> No! Put me down! Oh!
<b>TUCK &amp; ROLL:</b> Hey!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> My, you just pop right open there, don't ya?
<b>ANT KIDS:</b> Ooh! Wow!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Kids, he's kind of ticklish.
DIM: (laughing)
<b>ROSIE:</b> Let's come on out. Careful.
(RUMBLING)
<b>ANT KIDS:</b> (screaming and laughing)
<b>QUEEN:</b> Well, my boy, you came through! Aphie and I are very impressed.
<b>FLIK:</b> Princess Atta! Hey!
<b>FLIK:</b> Hey, guys, this is Princess Atta! She's the one that sent me to find you!
ANT KID 1: Did you see that really big bug?
<b>DR. SOIL:</b> He looks absolutely ferocious!
<b>THORNY:</b> They're our ticket out of this mess!
<b>DR. FLORA:</b> They came just in time!
So, Princess Atta, what... What do you think?
<b>ATTA:</b> No, no, no, wait! This was not supposed to happen.
<b>SLIM:</b> Mayday, mayday. We're losing the job.
<b>ATTA:</b> We don't fight grasshoppers!
<b>THORNY:</b> We don't, but they will.
<b>CORNELIUS:</b> Bingo!
<b>FRANCIS:</b> (pops lips) We've gotta sweeten the deal.
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls of all ages, our troupe here guarantees a performance like no other! Why, when your grasshopper friends get here, we are gonna knock them dead!
<b>SLIM:</b> These folks are sure hard up for entertainment.
<b>ANT KID:</b> Come on, come on. Hurry!
(panting)
Wow!
(PLAYING UPBEAT MUSIC)
<b>QUEEN:</b> Honey, relax. You should be proud of yourself. Your instincts on that boy were right on the money.
<b>QUEEN:</b> And to make our official welcome complete... Mr. Soil?
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> Yes, Your Highness?
<b>QUEEN:</b> He's our resident thespian. Last year he played the lead in Picnic.
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> The children, and myself, have quickly put together a little presentation in honor of our guests. Dot, Reed, Daisy, Grub?
<b>GYPSY:</b> Aren't they adorable! They're cute!
<b>GIRL ANT:</b> The South Tunnel Elementary School second-grade class would like to present you with this, a mural we have drawn of you bugs helping us fight the grasshoppers away.
<b>ROSIE:</b> Oh, look at the beautiful colors of the blood.
<b>DOT:</b> We drew one of you dying because our teacher said it would be more dramatic.
<b>CIRCUS TROUPE:</b> (gasps)
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> (whimpers)
<b>MR. SOIL:</b> I tell you a tale of heroes so bold, who vanquished our grasshopper enemies of old.
<b>ANT BOY:</b> Look, the last leaf has fallen.
<b>ANTS IN GRASSHOPPER COSTUMES:</b> We are the grasshoppers! Where's our food?!
<b>ANT BOY:</b> Who will come to save us poor ants?
<b>ANTS IN WARRIOR COSTUMES:</b> We are the warriors, here to defend you!
<b>ANT KID:</b> I die! Die! Die!
ROLL Hail, the bugs!
MR SOIL Thank you, thank you! Oh, thank you!
TUCK: Hey, hey, hey!
FRANCIS: I say we go.
QUEEN: Okay, honey. You're up.
(ATTA CLEARS THROAT)
We're all very, very grateful to have...
<i>[Flik crafts a megaphone and hands it to Atta.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> Here, here.
<b>ATTA:</b> (amplified) ...The warriors--
<b>ANTS:</b> (laughing)
<b>ATTA:</b> Thanks.
<b>ATTA:</b> (amplified) First of all, I'd like to thank the warriors for helping us in our fight against the grasshoppers.
<b>ATTA:</b> Secondly, I would like to thank Flik...
<i>[Flik waves.]</i>
<b>ATTA:</b> ...For his forthright thinking--
<i>[Flik takes the megaphone.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (amplified) Thank you, Your Highness. Sure, I'd like to take credit for all of this, but, well, that wouldn't be right. Because it was you, Princess Atta. You believed in me and you sent me on my quest.
<b>SLIM:</b> You tell that ant that we need to talk to him right now.
<b>ROSIE:</b> Okay, okay. All right.
<b>FLIK:</b> Now, I know that I've made a lot of mistakes in the past. And I hope that this will make up...
<b>ROSIE:</b> (whispers) Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> (quietly) Not right now, Rosie. I'm making a speech. (amplified) Now, I truly believe that these bugs are the answer to our...
<b>ROSIE:</b> (whispers)
<b>FLIK:</b> (quietly) No, there's no circus around here. (amplified) So I...
<i>[Flik looks over to the troupe, who peform a quick juggling routine and pose. The camera zooms through the crowd of ants onto Flik, whose eyes contract in horror.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> (whimpers)
<b>FLIK:</b> Your Highness, the warriors have called for a secret meeting to plan for a circus-- CIRCUMventing the oncoming hordes, so they can trapeze-- TRAP them with ease!
<b>ATTA:</b> Shouldn't I come, too?
<b>FLIK:</b> No! (laughs nervously) Sorry, no, you see, it's classified in the DMZ. Gotta go A.S.A.P. You know, strictly B.Y.O.B. Bye!
<b>FLIK:</b> Sorry. Sorry I have to take the warriors away so early, but, you know, they have a lot to get done, with the battle looming and all. So, please, everyone, enjoy the party.
<b>ATTA:</b> B.Y.O.B?
<b>FLIK:</b> Thanks again. Bye. Bye-bye.
<b>FLIK:</b> Okay, just... Just... Just get in there. Go! Go, go, go!
<b>FLIK:</b> Circus bugs?! How can you be circus bugs?!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> What?
<b>FRANCIS:</b> Hey, hey, hey. You said nothing about killing grasshoppers, pal. You lied to us!
<b>FLIK:</b> Are you kidding? Do you know what this is? This, my friends, is false advertising.
<b>MANNY:</b> How dare you! You, sir, are the charlatan in this scenario, touting your wares as a talent scout, preying upon the hungry souls of hapless artistes. Good day to you, sir.
<b>FLIK:</b> Wait! No, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! You can't go. You have got to help me. Give me some time. I'll come up with a plan.
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Just go tell them the truth!
<b>FLIK:</b> They can't... They can't know the truth. The truth, you see, is bad. I will be branded with this mistake for the rest of my life. My children's children will walk down the street, and people will point and say, "Look! There goes the spawn of Flik, the loser!" Oh... Oh, you know, all right, fine. Yeah, okay. Just go. But if you could just do me a little favor before you leave.
<i>[Flik lays down and places Dim's foot on his head.]</i>
<b>FLIK:</b> If you could just squish me, that would be great, because when they find out, I'm as good as dead.
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Huh?
<b>ATTA:</b> I really do think I should be part of this meeting. Flik!
<b>FLIK:</b> Princess Atta! What a nice surprise.
<b>ATTA:</b> Just what exactly is going on? I would like to speak with the so-called "warriors."
<b>FLIK:</b> You can't! They are in the middle of a top-secret meeting right now, and they really should not be disturbed now. Right, guys?
<b>FLIK:</b> (gasps) Could you excuse me, please?
<b>FLIK:</b> Wait, wait, wait! Please, don't go!
<b>ATTA:</b> I'm not going anywhere. What is going on? Flik?
<b>ATTA:</b> Flik! (groans) I knew it!
<b>FLIK:</b> Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait! Please! Don't go!
<b>FLIK:</b> No! No, no, no!
<b>SLIM:</b> Quick, he's losing it!
<b>FLIK:</b> You can't go! I'm desperate!
<b>SLIM:</b> Really? I couldn't tell.
<b>DOT:</b> Hmm.
<b>DOT:</b> Come on, wings.
<b>DOT:</b> (screaming) Help!
<b>ATTA:</b> Mother, Flik is up to something.
<b>FLIK:</b> No! No!
<b>SLIM:</b> Okay, Flik, time to put you down now.
<b>SLIM:</b> Get him off me. He's cutting off the circulation to my foot.
<b>FLIK:</b> No, no, no, no!
<b>SLIM:</b> Let go!
<b>FLIK:</b> Oh, please! Please! Don't go!
<b>ROSIE:</b> Put the stick down. Flik, I mean it now. Drop the stick. Drop it.
<b>FLIK:</b> Run!
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Boy, he runs fast for a little guy.

And as a tribute to Miss Francis, we've changed our bandannas!
DOT: We voted you our honorary den mother!
(KIDS CHEERING)
FRANCIS: What? Great.
DR FLORA: All right, girls. Let's move your little keisters out of here now. The patient needs her rest, you know. Come on.
ADDA; Excuse me, Flik. Can I talk to you just for a second?
FLIK: Oh, sure.
ADDA: Again, thank you all very, very much.
HEIMLICH: Oh, stop. You're too kind.
ALL: Thank you.
ADDA: You don't think I've offended the warriors, do you?
FLIK: You? No.
ADDA: Oh, good. Because, you see, when you first brought them here, I thought you'd hired a bunch of clowns.
FLIK: You did?
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)
ADDA: Don't tell them I said that. Boy, that's all I'd need, another royal blunder like that.
FLIK: Princess, you're doing a great job.
ADDA: Thanks. You're sweet. You're wrong, but sweet.
ADDA: I know what everyone really thinks.
FLIK: I don't follow you.
ADDA: Everyone, the whole colony. Nobody really believes I can do this job.
(SIGHS) It's like they're all watching me, just... Just...
ADDA/FLICK: Waiting for you to screw up.
ADDA: Flik, I owe you an apology.
FLIK: For what?
ADDA: Well, I haven't been that nice to you, and I'm sorry. If there's any way I can make it up to you... Hey! I know! How would you like to be the queen's official aide to the warrior bugs?
FLIK: Me?
ADDA: Oh, sure. You've got a great rapport going with them, especially after that rescue. It was very brave.
FLIK: Really? No, no...
ADDA: Well, not every bug would face a bird.
ADDA: mean, even Hopper's afraid of them.
FLIK: Yeah, well, I guess maybe I have...
FLIK: Say that again?
ATTA: I said, even Hopper's afraid of birds.
FLIK: Thank you.
FLIK: Hopper's afraid of birds!
FRANCIS: And I don't blame him!
FLIK: Oh, oh, oh, this is perfect. We can get rid of Hopper, and no one has to know that I messed up. You just keep pretending you're warriors.
ROSIE: Whoa, Flik, honey. We are not about to fight grasshoppers, okay?
FLIK: You'll be gone before the grasshoppers ever arrive. It'll be easy. Here's what we do.
MANNY: Not another word. I don't know what you're concocting in that little ant brain of yours, but we'll have no part of it.
VIOLET ANT BOY: Excuse me? Could we get the warriors' autographs?
HEIMLICH: Autographs? Yeah!
BLUE ANT BOY: -Oh, wow! Great!
FRANCIS: So you fellas catch the action today?
BLUE ANT BOY: The bird went... and it just missed you!
GYPSY: Aren't you sweet?
VIOLET ANT BOY: And the way you pretended to be stuck in that huge crack!
HEIMLICH: That's just all part of the plan.
BLUE ANT BOY: Yeah, yeah.
BLUEANT BOY: And then you dive-bombed into the bush!
MANNY: There you go, my boy.
VIOLET ANT BOY: Wow! Thanks!
BLUE ANT BOY: "Major..."
MANNY: That's Major Manny, young cadet. I outrank everyone here, remember that 
BLUE/VIOLET ANT BOY Yes, sir!
MANNY: Dismissed!
VIOLET ANT BOY: Wow!
BLUE ANT BOY: When I grow up, I'm gonna be a praying mantis!
VIOLET ANT BOY: I'm gonna be a stick bug!
BLUE ANT BOY: Oh, they're all so cool, I can't pick!
MANNY: (CHUCKLES) Delightful lads. You were saying, Flik?
FLIK: All right. We are going to build a bird, a bird that we can operate from the inside, which would then be hoisted...
MANNY: ...Hoisted above the anthill and hidden high in the tree. Then, right when Hopper and his gang are below, we'll launch the bird and scare off the grasshoppers. Now it's going to take...
ADDA: ...Everyone's involvement to make this plan a reality. I know it's not our tradition to do things differently, but if our ancestors were able to build this anthill, we can certainly rally together to build this bird!
(CHEERING)
ADDA: Perfect!
ADDA: Okay, hit your marks!

<b>GRASSHOPPERS:</b> La cucaracha, la cucaracha, da da da da da da...
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> We have more than enough food, and if we go all the way back there and it starts to rain, we might as well be suckin' bug spray.
<b>MOLT:</b> Ooh! Don't even say that! You know somethin'? You're making a lot of sense. I mean, why take the risk? You should tell Hopper.
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Good idea! But, you know, it's really not our place. I mean, you're his brother. That makes you, like, uh... The vice president of the gang.
<b>MOLT:</b> Wow! It kind of does, doesn't it? Okay, I'll tell him. Boy, I should talk to you guys more often.
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> What if Hopper doesn't like it?
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Then at least the genius will get smacked, and not us.
<b>MOLT:</b> Vice President Molt. Yeah, that's good. Oh, that's good.
<b>HOPPER:</b> A little lower. Lower, lower.
<b>MOLT:</b> Heya, Hop.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Go away.
<b>MOLT:</b> That's fine. Then I won't tell you my idea.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Good!
<b>MOLT:</b> Okay, okay. I'll tell you anyway. You see, I've been thinking, okay, which is something that I do. You know, being vice president and all. And thi-this is a thought, and it was mine: why go back to Ant Island at all? I mean, you don't even like grain.
<b>HOPPER:</b> What?!
<b>MOLT:</b> You're right. I didn't think it was such a good idea, myself. Actually, it wasn't even my idea. It was Axle and Loco's! They talked fancy to me. I got confused!

<b>HOPPER:</b> Guys... Order another round, because we're stayin' here!
-Yeah!
-Yeah!
<b>HOPPER:</b> What was I thinking? Going back to Ant Island. I mean, we just got here, and we have more than enough food to get us through the winter, right? Why go back?
(SINGING FOR HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW)
<b>HOPPER:</b> But...there was that ant that stood up to me.
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Yeah, but we can forget about him!
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Yeah, it was just one ant.
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Ooh! One ant! 
<b>HOPPER:</b> (laughs) Yeah, you're right! It's just one ant!
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Yeah, boss! Heh. They're puny!
<b>HOPPER:</b> Hmm. Puny. Say, let's pretend this grain is a puny little ant.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Did that hurt?
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> (chuckles) Nope.
<b>HOPPER:</b> Well, how 'bout this one?
<b>GRASSHOPPER:</b> Are you kiddin'?
<b>HOPPER:</b> Well, how 'bout this?
<i>[Hopper breaks open the bottle and the three grasshoppers are buried under an avalanche of grain.]</i>
<b>GRASSHOPPERS:</b> (screaming, fades)
<b>HOPPER:</b> You let one ant stand up to us, then they all might stand up. Those puny little ants outnumber us a hundred to one. And if they ever figure that out, there goes our way of life! It's not about food. It's about keeping those ants in line. That's why we're going back!

Wait a second.
CORNELIUS: Ain't that Staff Sergeant Slim?
FLIK: Nope! No, no, no. I'm sorry, no. I've never seen anyone like that around here.
SLIM: Be quiet!
FLIK: No one has ever seen anyone like that around here.
FLIK: So you'll probably want to get going. I guess you've got a lot of other anthills to check into, so bye!
P.T.: Ah, guys, I've been looking all over for you! Flaming Death is a huge hit!
FRANCIS: P.T.!
P.T. FLEA: I'm serious! Word of mouth got around. The next day, there was a line of flies outside the tent, went on forever!
P.T.: It must have been a foot long!
ROSIE: P.T., no!
P.T.: So I figured it out. You guys burn me twice a night, I take a day off to heal. And then we do it all over again! We'll be the top circus act in the business!
ADDA: You mean, you're not warriors?
P.T.: Are you kidding? These guys are the lousiest circus bugs you've ever seen. And they're gonna make me rich!
THORNY: You mean to tell me that our entire defensive strategy was concocted by clowns?
FRANCIS: We really thought Flik's idea was gonna work.
FRANCIS: Oops.
ANNA: Tell me this isn't true.
FLIK: No, you don't...
MR.SOIL; This couldn't have happened at a more inopportune time! The last leaf is about to fall!
FEMALE ANT: We haven't collected any food for the grasshoppers!
THORNY: If Hopper finds out what we almost did--
QUEEN: Hopper is not going to find out. We're going to hide all this and pretend it never happened. You bugs were never here. So I suggest you all leave.
FLIK: But the bird! The bird will work.
QUEEN : I never thought I'd see the day when an ant would put himself before the rest of his colony.
FLIK: What?
QUEEN : The point is, Flik, you lied to us.
FLIK: No, no, no! I... I just...
ADDA: You lied, Flik. You lied to her. You lied to the colony! You lied to me! And like an idiot, I believed you.
FLIK: But I... I was just afraid that if you knew I'd gotten circus bugs...

<b>HEIMLICH:</b> But I am flying! And from way up here, you all look like little ants!
<i>[Francis and Manny fly down and carry Heimlich away.]</i>
<b>HEIMLICH:</b> Auf Wiedersehen!
<b>FLIK:</b> Bye!
<i>[Atta and Dot lift Flik up and land on the root. They wave goodbye to the circus troupe. Thorny and the harvester-wearing ants line up.]</i>
<b>THORNY:</b> Present stalks!
<i>[The ants face backward.]</i>
<b>THORNY:</b> Harvester, salute!
<i>[The harvesters launch their stalks into the air, crashing into each other and producing firework-like showers of grain. Flik and Atta hold hands as they and Dot continue waving goodbye. The circus troupe flies away from the island, now surrounded by water and whose tree now bears pink blossoms.]</i>
