(SIGHS IN RELIEF)
(CLEARS THROAT)
Since you announced your retirement,
I've been thinking,
and, well, I've put together 50 reasons,
35 sub-reasons and a handful
of compelling arguments
why, of all the candidates to replace you,
-I should...
-Ted,
you're not one of the candidates.
Oh...
Thanks for seeing me, sir. I...
You're the only candidate.
-I am?
-Yes!
I couldn't imagine leaving
the Bloomsberry Museum
in the hands of anybody else.
-Not even Junior Bloomsberry?
-My son?
Heavens, no! He has other ambitions.
You've earned this, Ted.
(GASPS)
Me, a museum director!
(EXCLAIMS)
And all you've got to do is get approved
by the Board of Directors
at their annual meeting next week.
The Board of Directors?
But they're powerful, intimidating men,
with moustaches!
And male pattern baldness.
Relax, Ted. They're just as scared of you
as you are of them.
-Really?
-Absolutely.
No, wait, that's bears.
Anyway, just tell the Board
your vision for the museum.
Make them believe in you.
Inspire them.
No...
Huh? Oh! Oh!
Okay.
Sure, I can do that.
(CRASHING)
Ted, all of your hard work is finally
paying off, and I'm very proud of you.
But even future museum directors
need to take a little time off.
But I've only got one week
to put together my whole
"Priorities for the Future" presentation.
Most people only talk about the future.
Not me.
I put it in a binder!

Hi, George.
(CHATTERING)
What?

-You want to see the elephant?
-Uh-huh.
Sorry, George. Not today.
I gotta pick the colours for my bar graphs.
Today, I'm thinking earth tones.
-Has anybody seen my bar graphs?
-Bar graphs.
Hey! Mustard's a good colour.
Ted, all this important stuff
isn't the most important stuff.
You need to think about your loved ones.
You mean George?
I think of him all the time.
Those aren't toys, George!
See? Just thought of him again.
Ted, the people you really care about,
and who care about you,
need your attention now.
Or there may not be a "later."
Do you understand?
Sure, I understand! I do!
Hey, George! Pack your smile!
We're going to see the elephant!

Hey, boss, I'm no expert,
but I can't help but notice
that none of these people
has an elephant-sized bulge
underneath their coats.
I suppose, Ms Fisher,
you think that's clever?
But take away the elephant's water weight,
and you're left with 25 pounds of minerals.
You think someone dehydrated
the elephant?
A crime stuffer never rules out a possibility.
Next!
I suggest no sudden moves.
He's high-strung.
Ah, yes.
The man with the mischievous monkey.
Not mischievous, just curious.
Where is he, anyway?
Well, believe it or not,
George has gone missing, too.
Really?
It's not that strange.
He probably wandered off.
He does it all the time.
You know,
maybe Kayla wandered off with George.
-So that's your story? Your monkey did it?
-No!

Well, actually, that's an interesting illusion.
See, the moon is far away,

Can't get any worse than that.
Right.
(TRUMPETING)
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, can't get any worse.
Guess not.
Wait up!
So, what am I worried about?
Come on, George! Come on, Kayla!
If we're gonna make it to the animal park,
we'd better get moving!
(CHEERING)
Why not? If things can't get any worse,
they can only get better, right?
So let's have an elephant family reunion!
(CHATTERING HAPPILY)
Okay! Okay! I'm happy, too! I'm happy!
The park's just beyond
the Golden Gate Bridge.
(TED COUGHING)
(HELICOPTER WHIRRING)
This ain't good.
-Nobody move!
-Mr. Wolfe! I'm so glad you're here!
-Finally, we can clear this up.
-I told you not to leave town!
I tried not to. Believe me.
-You know, it's a funny story, really...
-Quiet!
Don't worry, Kayla.
Danno Wolfe is in charge now.
(GRUNTS)
Out of my way, banana breath.
-Leave him alone!
-Go ahead.
I've taken an 8-week
Internet course in karate.
-No!
-Hang on, Anna.
(GRUNTING)
Oh, please. That old trick?
(SCREAMING)
Pilot! Do something!
PILOT: That's a 10-4, boss!
You're all in my custody now!
Don't make me come out of this barrel!
Sorry, Mr. Wolfe.
I made a promise to my monkey.
I'm taking Kayla to see her family.
(SIREN WAILING)
My backup.
You have to hide. Now!
Not so easy with an elephant,
a monkey and a bright yellow suit!
I've got an idea. Come on!
(GRUNTING)
(BIRDS CAWING)
(TED READING)
Great!
TED: Kayla, look out!
A bus?
TED: No! No!
(EXCLAIMING)
Kayla, wait!
(TRUMPETING)
Come on, George!
Hi, folks! Here is your complimentary map.
(SCREAMS)
Apparently, she knows the way!
(CHATTERING)
(PEOPLE EXCLAIMING)
That's gonna cost us.
-Is that an elephant?
-Look out! Wild elephant!
(LAUGHING)
(TRUMPETING)
She sure was homesick.
You know,
coming here was a good idea, George.
It was all worth it for this.
Okay, I could have lived
without the driving off a cliff,
but I had the best time of my life!
Thanks to you, George.
Aha!
(GIBBERING)
-Rogue elephant! Stop her!
-No! No, she's harmless!
TED: Kayla, look out!
(TRUMPETING)
No. Hey!
Your crime spree ends here, monkey.
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say...
chitter
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.
(TED SIGHING)
Well, we'll be on the ground soon.
George, when we land,
some policemen are going to come,
and, well, I'm probably going to have
to go away for a while.
But don't worry.
Maggie will take good care of you. I promise.
I don't want to leave you, either, pal.
(GASPS)
(EXCLAIMS IN MOCK SYMPATHY)
The elephant kidnappers
are having a moment.
Now I'm supposed to get all mushy
and let you go.
You see this? Not an ounce of mush.
-What do you want?
-Me? Nothing.
I have everything I could ever possibly need.
You, the elephant, even this.
Would the monkey like a nice,
yellow banana?
(CHATTERING)
If you can get it, it's yours.
(LAUGHING)
Stop that!
(GRUNTING)
(LAUGHS)
There, there, elephant.
Here, go ahead and eat.
The man and the monkey can't hurt you now.
What? What? What?
You are a worthy opponent, monkey.
You're gonna have to do better than that
to get the best of me,
Danno Wolfe, Apprentice P.I.
Nice going, George!
We still need a plan.
We gotta reach Piccadilly
before the plane lands,
let him know this was just
a big misunderstanding.
(BEEPING)
-What's that?
-Cargo door probably popped open.
-Again.
-I'll secure it.
After you jump, just give it a pull.
Uh-oh!
Stop!
Easy, now.
(EXCLAIMING)
Here goes!
(SCREAMING)
(SCREAMING)
-Gotcha!
-Mr. Wolfe...
Head of Security.
George! Pull the ring beside you!
(SCREAMING)
-I'm losing my grip here!
-Hang on just a bit longer!
-About to plummet!
-Oh, boy.
Earth! That's good.
(GASPING)
I jumped from a plane
without a parachute and survived!
I am awesome!
Oh!
That was fun, wasn't it?
WOLFE: Hey! Can't see!
Didn't think the whole "no parachute" thing
through, huh?
Come on, we've got to get
to the theatre, George!
Oh, no, you don't!
(THUNDERING)
Hey! Wait for me!
(DOOR BUZZES)
(SQUAWKING)
We must be under the stage.
And now, for my final feat of magic,
I shall produce, from thin air,
a water fowl.
Who am I kidding?
There's no such thing as magic.
-What?
-What?
How it works is,
there are a bunch of levers and pulleys
and a dumb little button. You push it, and...
(AUDIENCE EXCLAIMING)
(GASPS)
Kayla! Oh, my!
Is it you?
(TRUMPETS)
It is magic!
MAN: Hear, hear!
Oh!
My beautiful Kayla!
(WOLFE EXCLAIMS)
I have you now, monkey.
(SCREAMS)
(CRASHING)
Guess who's back.
No monkey makes a chimp out of me!
Whoa!
(SCREAMS)
Put me down! Help! Mad elephant!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
What am I...
What am I doing wrong?
I think you need to work
on your people skills.
I bet they have an Internet course for that.
Mmm, mmm, mmm.
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Oh, boy! I'm late for the Board meeting!
(CHATTERING)
TED: Ladies and gentlemen,
I am really dedicated to this museum,
but between going cross-country
with my monkey,
falling off a train, biking off a cliff
and leaping from an airplane
with an elephant...
Well, you know what that's like.
Maybe not.
It's just, I got my priorities all mixed up.
Or, maybe they were mixed up before.
Because I've learned more
from one little monkey
than I ever figured out
from all my multicoloured pie charts.
This is what matters.
Families, friends, loved ones.
People, coming together.
It's my top priority,
and it should be this museum's!
We'll sponsor Living History days.
Young, old, father, son,
"All for One, One for All" days!
We'll share our past, our present,
our hopes, plans and dreams!
Also, I have a few ideas
for some cafeteria specials.
Hole in one! Congratulations, Mr. Director.
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, Mr. Bloomsberry.
Thank you very much.
(CHATTERING HAPPILY)
But I owe it all to George.
(LAUGHING)
Whoa!
Hang on, George!
(TRUMPETING)
(CHATTERING HAPPILY)
-Well, look at that.
-Oh, my goodness!
Subtitles: Arigon
(LAUGHING)
-Cheers!
-You're here!
-All of us!
-Are Tonga and Layla visiting?
Visiting? They've joined my act!
Now Kayla has her family,
and my act has 3 times the magic.
(WIND BLOWING)
TED: My hat!
(CHATTERING)
(CHUCKLING)
MAGGIE: What's he doing?
(ALL LAUGHING)
TED: Nice trick, George!
PICCADILLY: I taught him
everything he knows.
