(A man cloaked in blue leaves his footprint in the sand. Cassim looks at the Palace of Agrabah, miles ahead of him. Camels come up the hill behind him, wearing saddles and carrying cargo. A man peeks his head out of one of the baskets. Cassim pushes his head back inside the basket. Cassim and the camels make their way toward Agrabah.)
(Setting: Agrabah; the Palace)
(Rasoul stands at the Palace gate, arms folded. A Peddler approaches him, carrying a gray sack on his back.)
Peddler: Oooh, in all my years, never have I seen the streets so full of bustle and hustle and assorted commotion.
Rasoul: Our Princess is to wed.
Peddler: Oooh, wonderful! And who's the lucky prince?
Rasoul: Not a prince at all. Just a no account street rat.
(The Peddler reveals himself as Genie. Genie throws the sack on top of Rasoul)
Genie: No way! (Genie picks Rasoul up) Try it fanatically. (Genie shoots some magic into the sky) It's Aladdin! ('Aladdin' appears, written in generic lettering. Genie looks at the camera, sheepishly) Awww... Some of you don't believe. (Genie snaps his fingers, and the "Aladdin and the King of Thieves'" logo appears, fireworks behind it. Genie, as Tinkerbell, flies in front of the logo) In color. (Genie giggles and taps the logo with his magic wand, causing it to disappear.)
<br/>
PARTY IN AGRABAH ONE
(Genie is holding a snow globe version of Agrabah. A smaller Genie flies by him.)
Genie: There's a party here in Agrabah, there's excitement in the air.
People pouring in from near and far
(Genie flies by a camel, and hugs the driver and the camel)
'Cause Jasmine and Aladdin are gonna have a weddin'.
(Genie flies in front of a man riding an elephant. He sits down in front of the elephant, and turns into a manicurist. He starts doing a manicure on the elephant.)
There's a party here in Agrabah, everybody will be there
(Genie grabs the driver and another man. He changes their hair to giant afros.)
So if you're a pauper or a shah, do something with your hair.
You mustn't wear an outfit that's naughty
(Genie unravels a man's turban)
A turban that's unraveling just won't do
(As earrings on a woman's ear)
No earrings that are tasteless or gaudy
(Genie turns the woman into a fat woman with huge glasses. The woman screams and runs away)
You're gonna look gorgeous when I get through.
There's a party here in Agrabah, so I'm goin' to paint the town
(Genie, as a painter, waves his paintbrush at three women. Their burkas change into harem-style outfits)
If you want to see what colors are, follow me around.
(Genie, on an easel, flies through Agrabah. Newspapers appear in the hands of citizens.)
Crowd: Aladdin's gettin' married and it's gonna be
The wedding of the century
Genie: My buddy's getting married and you're gonna see
Just how much I can do!
(As an explorer)
You've heard of your safari bar mitzvahs
(As a giant, tiki-style pig)
You've all been to a luau sweet sixteen
But none of them compare to what this
(Genie opens a lid. A roasting pig with an apple in his mouth appears. The pig pulls the apple out of his mouth.)
The food with be disgusting, by evening you'll be busting.
There's a party here in Agrabah and it's got us all aglow
(Genie turns into Rocky Balboa)
If a street rat could have come so far, maybe I can do it
(Genie turns into Don King)
Sure, there's nothing to it!
(Setting: A balcony in Agrabah. A woman sings.)
Woman: There's a party here in Agrabah, but we're not sure that we'll go
(Genie, dressed in drag, appears behind her.)
For although the bride is la de dah, the groom is awfully low
(Genie pushes the woman out of the way. Genie appears in front of the palace, as Walter Cronkite. Another Genie walks behind him, wearing a Jafar mask.)
Genie: And now we take you down to the palace, where everyone has celebrated all night long
(The other Genie walks in front of the camera, and takes off the Jafar mask.)
Without Jafar and all his malice, everybody's happy
What could possibly go wrong?
(Setting: Palace of Agrabah; Courtyard)
(Cassim and the men in the baskets pop out and burst into song.)
Thieves: There's a party here in Agrabah, and we're gonna rob 'em blind
(Cassim pushes up to one of the baskets.)
Cassim: While they're all munching caviar, create a small disturbance; I'll sneak up from behind.
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Wedding Pavilion; Gift Table)
(Iago is sitting on top of the gift table. People walk by the table, putting down treasures. Iago pours a goblet full of coins over his head.)
Iago: There's a party here in Agrabah, and the loot is pouring in.
I like this wedding stuff so far.
Maybe if I'm pleasant, I'll get to keep a present!
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; The Wedding Pavilion)
Genie: We've ordered just a few tasteful flowers
(Genie dumps a cart full of flowers over himself and Sultan)
And valets who will carefully park for you
(In the courtyard, an elephant parks among a group of camels)
The bridesmaids have been dressing for hours
Girls you look just lovely and so grown up too
(Genie pinches the cheeks of Jasmine's bridesmaids. Genie appears back in the pavilion)
There's a party in Agrabah, yes a filling of the room
But there's something missing, yes, aha!
Sultan: Where is the groom?
<br/>
(Setting: Agrabah; Aladdin's Hovel)
(Aladdin and Abu enter the hovel. From an open hole in the floor, Aladdin picks out a box. He dusts it off. Genie's eye appears outside the hovel, scaring Abu.)
Genie: Hello? Somebody's going to be late for his own wedding!
Aladdin: Hold on Genie, there's something I need.
Genie (turns into a big breasted woman coming out of a cake.): I gotcha, it's a bachelor party, big boy! (Carpet is holding a glass of beer. Genie takes it away from him.) None for you, you're the designated flyer.
Aladdin: No, this is for the wedding.
(Aladdin opens the box, and reveals a dagger.)
Genie (As <a href="/wiki/Woody_Allen" title="Woody Allen">Woody Allen</a>): Well, uh, that's a nice dagger. Interesting nuptial accessory. It's a bit... sharp.
Aladdin: It belonged to my father.
Genie: Your father? You never said a word about your father. Oh, I've got to let the caterer know! (Genie turns into a caterer) Chicken or sea bass?
Aladdin: He's not coming to the wedding... he died a long time ago.
Genie: (Reverting back to normal) Sorry.
Aladdin: That's okay, I never knew him. Maybe if I did, I'd feel ready for this.
Genie: (Turns into bunny slippers on Aladdin's feet) Al, are you getting cold feet?
Aladdin: No, Genie. It's just that... I've always been a street rat. Stealing what I need to survive, runnin' from the guards...
Abu: Uh huh.
Aladdin: Living my life alone.
Abu: Oh...
Aladdin: I'm takin' a big step today, into a new world.
Genie (With headphones on his ears and a microphone in front of him): Today's topic, "Fears of the Future Family Man." Al from Agrabah, share with us.
Aladdin: I never had a father to show me how to raise a family.
Genie: No role model? Get a little deeper.
Aladdin: What do I know about families? Genie, what if I'm no good at it? (Genie changes back to normal) If my father were here...
Genie: Al, Little Buddy, if your father were here, he'd be as proud of you as I am.
Aladdin: I just wish he could see this.
<br/>
PARTY IN AGRABAH 2
Aladdin: There's a party here in Agrabah, and the party's all for me.
Just look you guys at where we are, and how are dreams have come to be.
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Jasmine's Chambers)
(Jasmine is in front of a mirror, wearing a traditional wedding dress with golden trim and a veil)
Jasmine: There's a party here in Agrabah, and I can't believe it's true. After all this waiting, here we are. We'll finally get to say 'I do'.
Aladdin: I never ever had a real family
Jasmine: I never ever had a real true friend
(Both of their faces appear in the air)
Both: Someone who could just understand me...
(Aladdin makes a motion to kiss Jasmine's image)
Iago: Hey, come on Aladdin, this mush has got to end!
(Genie changes the outside of the hovel to a shop environment. Iago has a party hat on his head and a party favor in his mouth. He blows on the party favor.)
Genie: There's a party here in Agrabah
(Genie holds out a clock)
And it's starting right away.
(Genie changes into a tailor, and changes Aladdin into his wedding robes)
Let's get you dressed 'cause you're the star
(Genie grabs Aladdin for a photograph)
Hey, come on, it's your wedding day!
(Genie and Aladdin walk arm and arm over the edge of the building. Abu and Iago follow, also arm in arm. Aladdin and Abu land on Carpet. The group flies away from the hovel and to the palace. They fly over a crowd)
Chorus: Aladdin's gettin' married and it's gonna be the wedding of the century. Amazing how Aladdin could have come so far!
Genie: They're finally gettin' married!
Sultan: They're finally getting married!
Thieves: They're finally gettin' married!
Iago: Look at all these presents!
Jasmine: We're finally getting married!
Abu: They're finally getting married!
Aladdin: I'm finally gettin' married!
(Aladdin and Carpet fly into the palace. Genie remains outside, and like a Gospel singer, leads the crowd.)
Chorus: They're finally gettin' married at the party in Agrabah!
(Aladdin lands in the wedding pavilion. Abu is guiding a ribbon down a pillar. Sultan is dancing)
They're getting married and it's gonna be such a sight to see.
Come on, go with me
(The wedding guests are dancing. Iago shakes Aladdin's hand.)
To the party in Agrabah!
(Confetti falls everywhere. Genie reverts to normal)
Genie: A party goin' on now, gotta party, gotta party. Help me! Can't stop myself! (Genie begins shaking his butt)Somebody rub the lamp, somebody rub the lamp, (Men in the crowd raise their eyebrows) Ah, you know I feel it... (Genie looks around) ah, that's enough. (Genie slinks off).
<br/>
(Setting: Palace Stables)
(Cassim watches the events in the pavilion. He begins unhooking a basket. From a basket behind him, a man cuts his way out. The man is tall, gray skinned, wearing a black vest, a red cumber bun, and baggy blue pants. On his left hand, he wears a golden, claw like weapon with three prongs. The man puts his hand on Cassim's shoulder.)
Sa'luk: Why do you walk in the open while I suffocate like an animal?
(Cassim shoves his hand away)
Cassim: Someone has to keep a cool head, Sa'luk.
Sa'luk: Someone will have no head if this is another wild goose chase.
(Sa'luk aims his claws towards Cassim's neck)
Cassim: The Oracle is the real thing. (Sa'luk pulls his claws away) This time I'm sure...
<br/>
(Setting: Palace of Agrabah; Courtyard)
Genie (Wearing a tuxedo and talking into a microphone): Hello, and welcome to "Lifestyles of the Rich and Magical!" That's right; we're taking you to the marriage of a millennium. And who's this coming on the lovely stretch camel? Oh it's Cleopatra and Caesar (Cleopatra and Caesar walk down the aisle together, waving) and they're bringing a salad, (assistants carry a giant salad behind them) how wonderful (Another assistant with a peppershaker follows). Oh look, there's Osiris, Oh Osiris, Osiris, could we have a word with you? (Osiris screeches). Oh no, the crowd is parting, who's coming? (A bearded Genie separates the crowd as he walks through it) It's Moses! And you're name is? (Genie holds the microphone in front of a tall, brown-skinned version of Genie)
Thor: I'm Thor.
Genie: You're Thor?
Thor: Well, it hurts.
Genie: Once again, this whole broadcast has been brought to you by sand. It's everywhere. (A logo appears reading 'Sand- it's everywhere'. Genie walks in front of it.) Get used to it!
(Setting: The Wedding Pavilion; Gift Table)
Abu: Come on, come on (Abu moves his hands in a 'come on' motion)
Iago: I can see fine from back here.
Abu: Uh uh, it's Aladdin!
Iago: Look, there's one thing I get sentimental about, and I'm sittin' on it.
(Abu picks Iago up by the tail. He looks under him, confused.)
Iago: The loot monkey, the loot!
(Setting: The Wedding Pavilion)
Genie: Bad news Al, the boutonnières clash with the cumber buns! (Genie holds out a white boutonnière and a brown cumber bun.)
Aladdin: Genie, isn't it a little late for that?
Genie: What, what are you trying to say? Out with it! (Genie looks around) What, what... (He sees the crowd) ...they're here. Oh no! (Genie changes into the White Rabbit from "<a href="/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland" title="Alice in Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>") I'm late; I'm late, for a very important date! (Genie runs through the aisle and through the doors.)
(As the doors swing back and forth, Genie steps back out, wearing a suit. Genie blows on a horn. He disappears. Abu runs down the aisle, and jumps on top of Carpet. Jasmine's bridesmaids walk down the aisle, followed by a little boy carrying a flag. Four guards walk down the isle carrying a throne with Sultan on it. The guests bow.)
Crowd: You're majesty, your highness!
(Abu chatters and waves wildly. Sultan laughs and waves to him. The guards reach the end of the aisle. Sultan runs off the throne and into the pavilion. Aladdin bows.)
Sultan: (Nudging Aladdin with his elbow) Don't look so solemn boy, this is a happy day.
Genie: Oh look, it's a Kodiak moment. (From Genie's left side, a bear roars. Genie grabs it by the mouth.) Put that bear out of here! (Genie makes a white carpet appear, led by doves. It covers the entire isle. The peacocks standing in front of the door contract their feathers, revealing Jasmine.)
Sultan: Ohh...
Aladdin: Wow....
Genie: Oh Yeah!
(Jasmine walks down the isle, to the ooos and ahhs of the crowd. When she reaches the end of the isle, Sultan takes her hand)
Sultan: I never thought this day would come. Now I'm afraid that it has come all too soon.
Jasmine: (Hugs Sultan) Oh father.
(Cassim walks away from Sa'luk.)
Cassim: You distract the guards
Sa'luk: Part of your plan?
Cassim: (He pets an elephant's trunks) A large part. (He knocks on one of the baskets) It's time.
Thieves: Oh!
(From the baskets, men emerge. Including a tall, fat man with a silly laugh, a thin man brandishing two swords, an Asian man who uses karate moves to shred his basket to pieces, a gray-skinned man floating on a rope, and a tall man carrying a sword)
Genie: It's all so magical. I'm not gonna cry. I'm not...
Cleopatra: It's so beautiful.
Caesar: I promise you I wouldn't cry.
(Caesar smiles and Genie breaks into tears. He blows his nose on Carpet. Realizing what he did, he lets Carpet go.)
Carpet: HEY!
Genie: Oh, sorry.
(Aladdin and Jasmine walk up a few stairs to the top of the pavilion.)
Aladdin: Well, we're here...
Jasmine: Together forever.
(Cassim is on the roof of the pavilion, angling his sword to the sun. On the ground, Sa'luk sees the reflection from Cassim's sword. Sa'luk smiles and walks a few feet to a nearby elephant that the tall, fat man is trying to push, with little luck. Sa'luk pushes him out of the way.)
Sa'luk: Let me be the point man!
(Sa'luk stabs the elephant in the butt with his claws.)
(The ground is shaking in the Pavilion)
Genie: I thought the Earth wasn't supposed to move until the honeymoon...
Sultan: Oh, oh, my word!
(Elephants burst through the pavilion.)
Genie: (Wearing a cowboy hat and plaids) Stampede!
(Guests scatter. Aladdin and Jasmine stay on the alter, watching. A piece of the ceiling falls onto the alter. Aladdin pushes Jasmine out of the way just in time)
(The gift table is shaking. Iago catches the falling treasures)
Iago: What is going on here?
(Back in the Pavilion, an elephant nearly smashes Abu)
Genie: Come here monkey boy, you were almost Dumbo toe jam! (An elephant walks over Carpet) Oh, they trampled the carpet... that's a little redundant. So this isn't really a bad day for you, is it?
(The shot shifts to the chandelier, where Cassim watches the palace guards. Rasoul, Hakim, and Fazal run into the pavilion.)
Fazal: It's an attack!
(Several wedding guests run out of the pavilion. The entering thieves push them back.)
Rasoul: Not in this palace!
(The men are doing karate moves and pinning the guests to the wall with knives. The thieves steal from them. More of the ceiling falls.)
Genie: Oh, I think we're going to have a little problem with leaks. (Genie flies to the ceiling and positions himself in front of the hole.)
(Cassim is at the gift table, pushing things out of the way.)
Cassim: It must be here somewhere!
(A golden plate flies by Cassim's head. He turns to see Iago, waving a candlestick.)
Iago: Meet your match, Zorro!
(Cassim approaches Iago)
Cassim: Good birdie! Polly want a little...
Iago: (Citing his shot with the candlestick) Say cracker and I'll let you have it on principle!
(Iago swings three times at Cassim, but misses each time. Cassim grabs the candlestick from Iago. He picks Iago up.)
Cassim: You have a lot of spirit. (Cassim pushes Iago into a nearby vase) And a lot of mouth.
(Rasoul charges for the tall, fat man. The tall, fat man pushes out his stomach, throwing Rasoul back.)
Thief: Ha ha ha!
(Rasoul lands behind Hakim and Fazal. Hakim and Fazal look at him for a second, then turn to Sa'luk, who is standing before them.)
Sa'luk: Ha ha ha!
(Sa'luk waves his claws in front of Hakim and Fazal three times, seemingly missing. Seconds later, Hakim and Fazal's clothing and swords fall to pieces. They are left in their tighty whites. Hakim and Fazal cover their groin areas.)
Fazal: They fight like demons!
Hakim: Worse than demons. These are the Forty Thieves!
(Hakim and Fazal slink off)
Genie: Really? I get thirty-nine...
(Aladdin looks around the room. He spots Cassim at the gift table.)
Aladdin: Forty.
Cassim: Where is it?
(Cassim pushes two jars out of the way. He stands up and looks around.)
Cassim: Ah, at last!
(Cassim grabs a treasure. It is long, golden, a green jewel at the head of it. Cassim raises it into the sky. He grunts, and falls to the ground. Standing above him is Aladdin, holding Cassim's treasure in his hand.)
Aladdin: Can I see your invitation?
Cassim: Stay out of my way boy and you won't get hurt!
(Cassim grabs an Egyptian cat statue beside him and throws it at Aladdin. Aladdin groans and falls back onto the gift table. Cassim stands up. He reaches over Aladdin, attempting to grab his treasure. Aladdin fends him off. The two wrestle for the treasure.)
Cassim: Fool, you don't stand a chance against the King of Thieves.
Aladdin: When I get up, I'll bow to you!
(Aladdin kicks Cassim away)
(In the Pavilion, Jasmine punches a thief in the face)
Jasmine: That was for ruining my wedding!
(Amazed by Jasmine's punch, two thieves stop to watch. Carpet flies out from underneath them, causing them to fall.)
Thieves: Huh?
(Cassim and Aladdin continue to try to overpower each other. Neither man has an advantage. )
(Genie moves away from the ceiling, noticing that the only part left is the part he was protecting)
Genie: I guess there's really no point to this now.
(Genie appears on the ground, blocking three thieves that are trying to get away. The thieves taunt him with their weapons. Genie raises his eyebrows up and down to the camera. About a dozen Genies appear, all of the dressed as ninjas in black. They are waving swords around. They stop and look at the thieves. The thieves run away. Genie hears an elephant making noise. Genie turns to it and smiles. Genie picks up the elephant and points his trunk at the thieves.)
Genie: Freeze sandbags; don't make me use the other end!
(Wind comes out of the trunk, blowing the triplets away. The elephant's trunk deflates. Genie puts it down. Genie shoots two other thieves in the butt with magic.
Genie (As <a href="/wiki/Forrest_Gump" title="Forrest Gump">Forrest Gump</a>): Mama always said 'magic is as magic does'.
Sa'luk: Cassim said nothing about facing the powers of a genie! (Turning to the tall thief behind him) Get the others out of here. We'll leave the King to his plans.
(Cassim has control of the treasure; he makes a run for it. Aladdin tackles him down at the ankle)
Cassim: Oooh!
(Aladdin kicks the vase that Iago is in; it hits the wall. Iago comes out, staggering and moaning. An elephant burst through the door leading to the gift table. Cassim and Aladdin stop and look at it. They make a last ditch pull on the treasure, and roll away from the elephant in separate directions. Aladdin has control of the treasure. Aladdin looks around the room and realizes he's alone.)
Aladdin: Where's the King of Thieves?
(Setting: Outside the Pavilion)
(The elephant that burst through the door runs outside. Cassim jumps from his back and looks at the crumbling wedding pavilion)
Cassim: I'll see you again, boy! (He runs off)
(Inside the Pavilion, the walls crumble.)
Genie: Oooh...This is not my fault! This was not built to code!
Iago: Good luck getting back the catering department.
Sultan: Oh my...
Genie: Fear not, oh father of the bride. (Genie turns into a construction worker with a muscular chest) We can rebuild!
Sultan: Oh, please do. We can't have a wedding without a pavilion! (Genie's chest muscles fall to his gut. Genie shrugs)
Genie: (Writing on a clipboard) All right, a wedding pavilion it is my man. (Genie turns Iago, Abu, and Carpet into construction workers. Iago is eating a sandwich. Abu is eating a doughnut. Carpet is reading the paper) Hey, I want to see some resumes on these guys. And don't let the one with the beak near any power tools. (A drill sounds)
Sultan: Yes, yes, Genie, whatever it takes. I am sorry about all this Jasmine. (Jasmine is gone) Daughter?
(Jasmine is at the gift table, with Aladdin)
Jasmine: What were they after, the gifts?
Aladdin: Not all the gifts. This is what the King of Thieves wanted. (Holds out the treasure)
Iago: (Landing on the treasure) With all the other great stuff, why go for this thing?
(From the treasure emanates a bright light. Iago flies away from it and lands on Aladdin's hand. A visage of a woman appears in the air)
Oracle: Your question is mine to answer! The King of Thieves sought my sight to find the Ultimate Treasure.
Iago: Did someone say treasure?
Aladdin: (To Genie) Genie?
Genie: (Wearing sunglasses) Oh... Looks like an Oracle.
Oracle: I see all that has been, and all that will be.
Genie: (As <a href="/wiki/Dustin_Hoffman" title="Dustin Hoffman">Dustin Hoffman</a> in "<a href="/wiki/Rain_Man" title="Rain Man">Rain man</a>") Uh oh, uh oh, definitely an Oracle, tells the future, uh oh. (To Jasmine, back to normal) Girlfriend, where were you registered?
Iago: Okay, you know all, so tell all. Where is the treasure? You know, the ultimate one?
Oracle: I am bound by the rule of one. One question, one answer.
Iago: I only want one answer! Where is the Ultimate Treasure?
Oracle: You have already asked your question.
Iago: You mean before? Oh, that wasn't a question! That was uh... thinking out loud.
Genie: (Grabbing Iago) Very loud.
Jasmine: Aladdin, we could learn anything. About our lives, our future.
Oracle: You have but to ask.
Aladdin: (To Jasmine) I know what my future is, my future is you. But my past... it's a blank. My mother died when I was just a kid, and I never even knew my father. I have no idea where I come from.
Oracle: Your question is your choice. But remember the rule of one. Choose carefully.
Iago: Oh sure, she warns him about the one question thing. (Carpet hits him out of the way) Hey!
Aladdin: I don't think you can help me. My past isn't just one question, it's a million questions.
Oracle: Ah, but mere questions about your past can be answered by your father...
Aladdin: My father? (The Oracle moves her hands, making a picture appear. It is an older man, with a strong resemblance to Aladdin) My father is alive...
<br/>
(Setting: The Marketplace, sundown)
(Abu and Carpet are in the Marketplace, pacing. Jasmine approaches them.)
Jasmine: Abu, where's Aladdin? (She looks up to see Aladdin in his hovel) How long has he been up there?
(Setting: Aladdin's Hovel)
Jasmine: (Entering the hovel) Aladdin, Are you alright? (She picks up the Oracle and sits beside Aladdin) What's wrong?
Aladdin: I always wanted to know about my father. But just now, I'm not so sure. (Standing up) What kind of man leaves his son? Did he even care? (Sighs) Maybe I don't wanna know him.
Jasmine: Yes you do.
Aladdin: How can you be so sure?
Jasmine: Because I already know him. (Aladdin seems confused) Because I know you.
<br/>
OUT OF THIN AIR
Jasmine: You showed me the world when I was all locked up inside.
You reached out your hand and took me on a magic carpet ride.
(Jasmine leads Aladdin onto Carpet, who is now beside them.)
One look at your smile and I could see the light, shining every where.
People like you don't come out of thin air.
(Carpet stops in front of a building. Aladdin gets off him.)
Aladdin: Oh Jasmine...
You don't understand.
There is so much that you don't see.
(In the city below, a younger Aladdin appears. Two kids run by him, and into their father's arms. Young Aladdin smiles.)
Just think if you can what growing up had to be like for me.
(The father and the children go in their house, slamming the door on young Aladdin. Young Aladdin walks away, slowly)
Your father's a man who taught you who you are.
(Young Aladdin disappears. The camera view switches back to adult Aladdin.)
Mine was never there.
So how can you say, I don't come out of thin air?
(Aladdin and Jasmine are now on the Palace balcony)
Aladdin: There's so much I want to know
Jasmine: You've got the chance to learn.
Aladdin: If it means, I'd have to go...
Jasmine: I'll be right here when you return. Our wedding can wait.
(Aladdin hugs Jasmine)
Aladdin: I love you.
Jasmine: I think it's worth this small delay.
(Abu hands Aladdin the Oracle)
Aladdin: Maybe you're right.
Jasmine: And won't it be great to have your father see our wedding day? It isn't too late.
Aladdin: I've waited so long to learn the truth.
Both and Abu: And now at least, we can finally say.
Jasmine: You're father is really there.
Aladdin: There's so much that we might share.
Jasmine: And you'll finally learn, you
Both and Abu: Don't come out of thin air.
(Jasmine and Aladdin raise the Oracle into the sky.)
Oracle: Have you chosen your question?
Aladdin: I have.
Oracle: Then ask.
Aladdin: Where is my father?
Oracle: (Pointing) Follow the trail of the Forty Thieves. Your father is trapped within their world.
Aladdin: The Forty Thieves? Is he hurt? How long has he been their prisoner?
Oracle: I am sorry. I can only answer one question. (The Oracle disappears)
Aladdin: It's up to me.
Jasmine: Take as long as you need.
Aladdin: I'll be back in time for our wedding, I promise.
(Jasmine and Aladdin hug.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Desert)
(The gang is flying on Carpet.)
Iago: I should have stayed with the Genie. Manual labor beats danger any day.
(Aladdin looks down to see a group of horse tracks in the sand. Two horses turn a corner up ahead)
Aladdin: Good, the trail's still fresh.
Iago: Definitely should have stayed with the Genie... (Carpet speeds up to catch the horses) Ah!
(Carpet turns the corner the thieves did and nearly runs into them. They are stopped in front of the sea.)
Aladdin: Shh... (Carpet flies back behind the cliff.) ...Phew. Well they have nowhere to go, we have them trapped.
Iago: We? They are Forty Thieves. We are you, a rug, a monkey, and me. Wait, don't count me.
Aladdin: They're just standing there
(From the front of the group, Cassim raises his arms into the air)
Cassim: Open sesame!
(The water in the sea separates and opens a door in the cliff face. Cassim and the thieves ride in.)
Aladdin: Let's move. Hang on! (Aladdin and the gang follow, making it in just before the door closes. Aladdin looks over a rock and into the lair. The lair is golden and misty, like a long-forgotten city.) I know Carpet, it's incredible. (Carpet grabs Aladdin and points toward the door) What?
Iago: How bad is it? (Iago has his tail feathers stuck in the door)
Abu: Hmm...
(Abu spits on his hand and pulls Iago out.)
Iago: Yee ow! Ohh, this is attractive! (Iago's feathers are stuck in the door. He walks over, pulls them out, and puts them back on his tail.)
Aladdin: (Shakes his head) Come on.
<br/>
(Setting: Farther into the lair)
(Aladdin looks up and sees a golden Minotaur head mounted to the wall. Abu and Iago back into each other and fall into a river. )
Iago: Ya wanna not hold up traffic? (Ringing out his feathers) I want to get in, get out, and go home. Actually, I wouldn't mind skipping right to the go home...
(Aladdin shushes Iago. From below, Sa'luk's voice is heard. Aladdin looks down at him. Sa'luk and other thieves are standing in front of a bare table.)
Sa'luk: We could have had all the loot from the wedding. But we followed the king's plan. This is what we have to show for our trouble in Agrabah: NOTHING!
(Sa'luk punches the table, causing it to fall apart. Some of the thieves yell in agreement.)
Fat, White Man (Elbowing the Asian thief beside him): This oughta be good!
Fat, Asian Man: Sa'luk is truly ticked!
Sa'luk (Approaching Cassim): Your time draws to a close, Cassim.
Aladdin: Cassim? My father...
Cassim: If you're talking about spilling my blood, well, I just don't see that happening. (He folds his arms and smirks defiantly)
Sa'luk: Then let me open your eyes!
(Sa'luk swings his claws at Cassim. Cassim starts to dodge, when Sa'luk is tackled by Aladdin. Aladdin sits on Sa'luk's back, trying to hold him down. Sa'luk seems bored.)
Aladdin: Run, I've got him! I'm Aladdin, you're my father!
(Cassim gasps. Sa'luk rolls over, pushing Aladdin onto the ground. The Midas Dagger falls out of Aladdin's pocket)
Thieves: His Father?
(Cassim picks up the dagger)
Sa'luk: I don't know about father boy, but I'll send you to meet your other ancestors.
(Sa'luk tries to claw Aladdin, but Cassim grabs his hand.)
Cassim (Looking at the dagger): Let him go. The boy... is my son. (Cassim raises the dagger into the air) I gave this dagger to my wife years ago. I told her to give it to our new born son...Aladdin.
Fat, White Man: It's true?
Fat, Asian Man: Ohh, the boy is the son of the King of Thieves.
(Aladdin stands up.)
Aladdin: *You* are the King of Thieves?
Cassim: Like it or not boy, we're blood. (Cassim throws the dagger to Aladdin) Look at you. I'd thought I'd never see you again. Has it been so long?
Sa'luk: Blood or mud, the boy is an intruder. (Sa'luk steps in between Cassim and Aladdin. He shoves Aladdin out of the way.) And we have rules about intruders.
(Aladdin looks around the room. Thieves grab Iago, Carpet, and Abu.)
Thieves: Sa'luk is right. He knows our secrets! I hate intruders. Wait, wait, me too!
Sa'luk: He has found our secret lair. He has seen too much. He must die. They must all die!
Iago: Die? He's your son. (Abu nods in agreement) I'm his friend! (Abu gives Iago a dirty look) Cast a vote for mercy here!
Sa'luk (Look back at Cassim): Yes, Cassim, mercy would be so like you. Soft and weak.
(Cassim gives Sa'luk a dirty look.)
Thieves: Maybe Sa'luk should be king? Yes, maybe he should
(Cassim appears to be thinking.)
Cassim: Kill him.
(Sa'luk grabs Aladdin. Sa'luk raises his clawed hand into the air. He is stopped from swinging, however, when Cassim speaks up.)
Cassim: Or the boy could, yes the boy could... no.
Tall, Fat Man: What, what? The boy could what?
Cassim: Nothing, probably a bad idea.
Triplets: Let's hear it.
Cassim: Well, it seems to me that... oh never mind.
Sa'luk (Now standing behind Cassim): What?
Cassim: The boy could face 'the challenge.'
Thieves: Ah...That's right, 'the challenge.'
Cassim: That's that, my son shall face 'the challenge.'
(Sa'luk reaches in front of Cassim, putting his claws in Aladdin's face. Cassim holds Sa'luk back.)
Sa'luk: And I shall be the one to test him.
Iago (Landing on Aladdin's shoulder): A test, huh? Ah, that's not so bad. Maybe it will be multiple choice?
(Lightning flashes.)
(Setting: Outside the Lair)
(A thief waves in a 'come on' motion to the camera. The Asian thief walks up some stairs, where Sa'luk is seen standing in a ring.)
<br/>
(Setting: On Top of The Cliff Above the Forty Thieves Lair)
(Several Thieves walk by. Abu and Iago are in a wooden cage, guarded by the Asian thief and the Skinny White Man. Abu chatters to Iago.)
Iago: Escape? Not likely. Our ride home is grounded.
(Camera pans to see the Fat, White Thief sitting on top of Carpet.)
Iago: And Al? Well... it's been nice knowin' 'em.
Aladdin: What's goin' on, Dad?
Cassim: Oh, the challenge is simple enough... only one man survives. But you're my son. You'll be that man. Knock 'em dead kid, seriously.
(A thief lowers a sword, indicating the start of the challenge. Sa'luk tries to scratch Aladdin with his claws, but misses. Aladdin falls back into the arms of some thieves. They shove him back in toward Sa'luk. Sa'luk tries to catch Aladdin again, but Aladdin kicks out Sa'luk's legs, causing him to fall)
Thieves: Go Sa'luk! Kick 'em!
(Sa'luk gets up and tries to get Aladdin again. Aladdin ducks and kicks Sa'luk in the ribs. Sa'luk swings again and scratches Aladdin.)
Aladdin: Ah! (Aladdin grabs his arm)
(Sa'luk drops his claws toward Aladdin. Aladdin pulls out the Midas dagger and fends them off. They have a power struggle; Sa'luk pushes Aladdin back. Aladdin runs into a torch and it falls, creating a wall of flame that blocks the rest of the thieves. Sa'luk punches Aladdin in the face. Aladdin gets back up and keeps fighting. Sa'luk punches Aladdin again. Aladdin falls to the group. Sa'luk picks Aladdin up.)
Cassim: No!
(Sa'luk throws Aladdin off the cliff. Aladdin, falling down close to the cliff face, manages to stick the Midas Dagger into the cliff. He stops sliding and drops down onto a small ledge. Looking down, he sees that he is very high up. Aladdin sighs. Aladdin leans back against the cliff; he hears grinding stone. Sa'luk is sliding down the cliff face using his claws. Sa'luk lands on the ledge; Aladdin moves back. Aladdin looks up and notices the Midas Dagger, still in the cliff face. Sa'luk swings his claws at Aladdin; Aladdin dodges. Aladdin jumps and grabs the dagger. He swings and kicks Sa'luk. Sa'luk loses his balance and falls of the cliff, screaming. Aladdin reaches to help him, but Sa'luk is already gone. Aladdin looks over the edge for a second, until a rope comes down for him. He climbs up, stopping to pick up the Midas Dagger along the way. Aladdin looks at the dagger, angrily, before grabbing it and continuing to climb up the cliff face.)
(Aladdin reaches the top of the cliff face, to be surrounded by the Forty Thieves)
Iago: I thought oz-eyed won?
Aladdin: Look, I...I... I didn't mean...
Thieves: Get him! Take him to the King! (The thieves pick Aladdin up and pass him to Cassim)
Iago: (The thieves cut open the cage) I don't even know Aladdin, okay? (The thieves free Iago and Abu and pass them to Cassim)
Cassim: You killed Sa'luk. The code of the Forty Thieves is very clear on this point. You're in!
Thieves: Yah!
<br/>
WELCOME TO THE FORTY THIEVES
Thieves: Congratulations, bub!
You've joined the club
And everybody here agrees
(A thief ties Aladdin up with a rope. Other thieves pull up onto a higher level. They push him back down onto a waiting group of thieves.)
We've got the finest blend of nearly honest men
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
(The thieves drop Aladdin. Aladdin is annoyed)
A fraternity of thugs that you can trust
There's nothing up our eighty sleeves
Got lots of grub to share, pull up a easy chair
(A man throws some fruit at Aladdin and another shoves a chair underneath him)
Welcome to the Forty Thieves
Now you get to lie and cheat
Never have to brush your teeth
But we always aim to please
(Iago sees a pile of gold and sneaks over to it. He is grabbed by a thief and thrown onto a table. The Triplets throw a blanket around him, put an icepack on his head, and shove a thermometer in his mouth.)
Care for one another, you'll never miss your mother!
Iago: Oh, I love you guys.
Thieves: Schemin' up a scam
Out on a limb
Taking whatever we please
And if you like to work, you're gonna love this work!
Welcome to the Forty Thieves!
Welcome to the Forty Thieves!
(Thieves throw Aladdin's chair. Aladdin grabs a rope on the way down. The rope is cut and he falls to the ground. Iago tries again to get treasure; a thief throws knives at him. He jumps in the treasure to hide. Cassim puts his arm around Aladdin.)
Cassim: Together we're the perfect team
Larceny is in the genes
Dare to share the family dream
Iago: Live a life o' leisure, counting all your treasure!
(A thief pulls Iago out of the treasure and throws him into Aladdin's arms.)
Thieves: As an honorary member of the gang
That no one alive ever leaves
You gotta snatch and sneak
Or else your future's bleak
We got a lifetime contract that your bound to keep
You wanna save your skin, ya better fit right in!
(The thieves dance around, juggling swords and playing with fire.)
Wel, wel, welcome, to the
Wel, wel, welcome to the
Forty Thieves!
<br/>
(Setting: Outside the Forty Thieves Lair)
(The water outside the lair is calm. Two sharks are swimming in the water. From under the surface, Sa'luk appears, wrestling a shark. He throws it into the water and punches it. The shark looks at him; Sa'luk looks back with shark like, yellow eyes. The shark lands on the beach, dead. Sa'luk comes out of the water, sighs, a walks away from the Lair.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Jasmine's Balcony)
(Jasmine is standing on her balcony, sadly looking over the city.)
Genie: Boy, and I thought I was blue. (Genie appears down beside Jasmine)
Jasmine: You would know if Aladdin is in trouble, wouldn't you? (She turns to Genie) I thought he'd be back by now.
Genie: Al will be back... (Genie pauses for a moment, then perks up as if he has an idea. He turns into Mrs. Doubtfire) Listen to Genie dear, Genie knows. You have to get your mind off this incessant waiting. (Genie poofs himself and Jasmine into the throne room) Here's a surefire way to cheer up a bummed out bride to be. A heaping helping of matrimonial magic! (Genie makes gifts appear all through the throne room. Gifts include bouquets of flowers, cars, baby carriages, and balloons. Jasmine reaches to pick a flower from a bouquet, when Genie, as Harpo Marx, jumps into her arms and tries to kiss her. A cane pulls him away. Genie as Chico Marx walks up to Jasmine) Hey, that's no good. What a wedding needs is a theme. (Genie as Grouch Marx walks up to Jasmine) It needs a groom too, but let's work with what we have...
Jasmine: Genie!
Genie: (Back to normal) It's a joke. I do that. Okay, let's see... this will be the second wedding for both of you. I'm thinking we need something a little more simple, a little more elegant and less gray. (Makes an elephant appears) Ha, ha, ha! Did it, done it, own it! (Makes the elephant disappear) I gonna' throw some colors at you, mauve, teal, and salmon. (Genie makes paint slabs appear in Jasmine's hand. For the salmon, however, a real fish appears) What do you like, besides the salmon? (Genie throws the salmon against a wall) Okay, Madonna. Don't keep it. Just put that in the mix, wink. (Genie nudges Jasmine with his elbow) Okay, I see lasers! (Genie turns the throne room into a Las Vegas-like atmosphere, complete with lasers and flashing lights) It's a miracle! He believes, he believes! (Genie turns into Elvis Presley) Thank you very much!
Jasmine (Giggling): I don't think so...
Genie: (Back to normal) Tres gauch right? Well, maybe you could elope? No, you can't elope. But oh honeydew! (Genie throws a honeydew melon to the center of the room) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! (The honeydew turns into a carriage. Jasmine's attire changes to Cinderella's) I don't whether to put it under props or produce. Please, don't squeeze the tires, they're not ripe. And how 'bout that gown? (Genie makes the carriage disappear. Jasmine appears in Snow White's down, with forest animals all around her. Genie acts as an announcer) Whether you're dancing with dwarves or simply biting the apple, it says I'm a princess for now!
Jasmine: Uh, Genie...
Genie: (Changing Jasmine back to normal) Hey, it's Synergy. (Other Genies wearing lab coats appear. One holds up a picture of Jasmine. Another Genie holds up pictures of Ariel's, Minnie Mouse's, and Jessica Rabbit's clothing in front of the picture of Jasmine) The marketing guys are very excited, it tests really well!
Jasmine: Thank you, Genie. I'm sure it will be wonderful. (Kisses Genie on the cheek) And thanks for cheering me up.
Genie: (as <a href="/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>) I'm sure Ali Baba and the boy are on the road to Agrabah right now. Isn't that right Bob? (As Bob Hope) That's right, Bing, how 'bout this town? Is it wild or what? It's like one giant sand trap, and me without my wedgie. Hey, let's give a big hand for Brooke Shields.
<br/>
(Setting: The Forty Thieves Lair)
Cassim: I find my son, and lose my enemy. You did your old man proud, Aladdin.
(Cassim is walking through a river, carrying a torch.)
Aladdin: I was just trying to stay alive.
Cassim: Ha! If you didn't fight, you would have been killed. So says the code of the Forty Thieves.
Iago: Does this code have any rules that don't end in death?
Cassim: It's a strict code. But there's one thing that I added. We never hurt the innocent.
(Cassim stops in front of a wall covered in markings.)
Iago: For future reference, I'm as innocent as the day I was hatched.
Abu: Oh brother...
Cassim: My men don't even know about this place.
(Cassim pulls a brooch off his cape, and puts it into a carving on the wall. The wall slides away to reveal a room. Everyone walks into the room. Cassim begins lighting the torches in the room.)
Cassim: Listen boy, there is a treasure. The Ultimate Treasure. (Cassim throws his torch into water, extinguishing it.) Compared to this, a pharaoh's tomb is a pauper's grave. A sultan's fortune nothing but... lunch money! And I am this close to it... (Cassim makes a gesture with his hand, indicating how close.)
Iago: That's tantalizingly close...
Cassim: But it's on an island that is never in the same place twice. (Cassim digs into a closet and pulls out a rug.) The Vanishing Isle.
Iago: That... would be a problem.
Aladdin: What is this Ultimate Treasure?
Cassim: The big one, boy. The Hand of Midas.
(Cassim unravels the carpet. It is blue, marked with a large design of a turtle. In the middle of the turtle, there is a blue and yellow ring. Inside the ring, is a golden hand, the same hand as on Cassim's brooch and the Midas Dagger. )
Aladdin (Rolling his eyes): It's just a myth!
Cassim: It's not a myth, boy.
(Cassim grabs a torch. He pulls aside a green curtain, revealing steps leading to the sea. Cassim makes his way down the stairs. The others follow.)
Cassim: It was once right here, look, there's your proof. (Cassim angles the torch to the water. A reflection of a golden ship appears.) From stern to stem, every piece of rigging every peg and board, all of it! Solid gold!
Abu (Hanging over the ledge): Oooh...
Iago: Adopt me Daddy-o!
Cassim: Touched by the Hand of Midas
Aladdin: And sunk by it...
(Aladdin makes his way up the stairs.)
Cassim: You don't understand. You don't know what it's like to have nothing. To stare up at the palace and know you deserve more. (Cassim throws the torch into the water) To be called "street rat".
Aladdin (Going through the curtain and into the main room): Yes, I do.
Cassim: I knew exactly what I wanted for my family, the best. (Cassim, coming through the curtain, puts his arm around Aladdin's shoulders.) I couldn't give up and go back empty handed. But the weeks turned into months and the months turned into years... I came back to Agrabah one night, but I couldn't find my wife, or my son. I thought my family was lost forever. At that moment, I would have traded anything to get your mother back...
Aladdin: We never wanted gold... we wanted you. I wanted a father, I still do. Come to my wedding. This time, you have an invitation.
Cassim: Aladdin, I just don't know...
Aladdin (Putting his hand on Cassim's shoulder): Dad, I'm not going back to Agrabah until morning. At least think about it?
(Aladdin and Abu exit)
Cassim: Aladdin may never understand, but it just wouldn't work. I don't belong in his world.
Iago (Landing on Cassim's shoulder.): The Oracle doesn't belong in his world either. It belongs in the hands of two enterprising treasure hunters, you and me.
(Cassim pushes Iago off his shoulder.)
Cassim: The Oracle... probably just another dead end.
(Cassim walks away from Iago.)
Iago: It works! That's how the kid found you, it knows everything!
(Cassim stops walking. He looks back in the direction that Aladdin went in, with a smile on his face.)
Cassim: Everything?
Iago (Landing on a book bearing the symbol of Midas): And I know where they stashed it. Cassim, we're talking about the wedding of your only son.
Iago (Rubbing his hands together): It's a once in a lifetime opportunity...
Cassim (Resting his hand on his chin with a smile): How can I pass it up?
<br/>
(Setting: Agrabah; Night)
(Rasoul walks in the city, holding out his sword. From a distance, he hears a voice.)
Sa'luk: Captain, over here!
Rasoul (Pointing his sword toward Sa'luk): Show yourself!
(Sa'luk is leaning in a nearby doorway)
Sa'luk: You're alone, good.
Rasoul (Approaching Sa'luk): So, you are the one with information about the Forty Thieves?
Sa'luk: What would you say if I handed you the King of Thieves?
Rasoul: I'd say... (Rasoul puts his sword away) ...what's in it for you?
Sa'luk: I'll just sleep better knowing that he's off the streets... and on the executioner's block.
Rasoul: Everyone knows that the King of Thieves cannot be caught. What miracle do you possess?
Sa'luk (Walking closer to Rasoul): Two words that will make you Agrabah's greatest hero- Open Sesame.
(Rasoul stares at Sa'luk with suspicious eyes.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Forty Thieves' Lair; Dawn)
(Cassim, Iago, and Abu are standing outside the lair. Aladdin, riding on Carpet, flies over to them)
Aladdin: Hop on, Dad!
Cassim: Oh no! It's a rug, you sweep dirt under it, you don't fly on it. At least, I don't.
Aladdin: (Circling Cassim) Don't be afraid, it's fun!
Cassim: I am not afraid! Now, get off that thing before you break your neck!
Aladdin: I trust Carpet with my life! (Aladdin jumps off Carpet) (To Carpet) Give 'em time, he'll come around.
Cassim: (Walking up some stairs) We'll take horses. Horses were good enough for my father, and his father before him. And they were always good enough for me.
Aladdin: He sounds like a father, alright.
Abu: Uh huh.
(Aladdin and Cassim ride away from the lair on horses. They take the northern passage.)
(From the southern passage, Rasoul and the guards ride approach the sea.)
Rasoul (Stopping his horse): Whoa! This is the spot men.
Fazal: But there is nothing here!
Rasoul: Now, but watch. (Opening his arms, with a big smile on his face) Open Caraway! (Nothing happens. Rasoul smile fades)
Hakim: There is still nothing here...
Rasoul: When I get a hold of that no good... (Rasoul turns around to leave)
Fazal: But I thought you said it was Open Sesame?
(The ground shakes and the passage to the lair opens. Rasoul turns around and smiles.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Outside)
Aladdin: Looks like Genie has everything ready...
Abu: Yeah, uh huh.
Cassim: Genie? You have a Genie? Have you used all three wishes yet?
Iago: Oh, please, don't go into it. It's just too painful.
(Genie appears)
Genie: Oh, Al! You're back! And you're front! You're both here! (Genie hugs Aladdin)
Aladdin: That's great, Genie...
Genie: (Puts his hand over Aladdin's lips, silencing him.) Security's tight. No big crowd, immediate family only.
Aladdin: Perfect, because this is my...
Genie: No lowlifes this time, other than the parrot of course. Observe... (Genie pulls out a remote. He pushes a button, and a giant robot comes out.]
Robot: You have violated the perimeter of the Aladdin and Jasmine wedding; prepare to be vaporized, thank you. (A laser shoots toward the group. They all duck)
Genie: Armed and dangerous. I'd like to see one of those Forty Thieves get within an inch of your wedding. (Makes a gesture with his fingers)
Iago: Allow me to introduce...
Cassim: Ha ha, the King of Thieves
Genie: Ah! All units, we have a code red ("Code red" echoes about as dozens of Genies in army uniforms come out of all corners of the Palace. Another posse of Genies, as Scotsman wearing kilts, appears) Come on boys, follow me! (The Genies approach the group, playing bagpipes. Another posse of Genies appear, as soldiers on horses) Calvary commence! Code red! (A plane flies over the palace. Genie soldiers jump out.) Geronimo! Arapaho! Navajo! (Genie, dressed as Pocahontas, jumps out of the plane) Pocahontas! Code red. (Hundreds of Genies carrying guns surround Cassim and Iago.) Do not attempt to move, or we'll be shooting ourselves.
Aladdin: (Breaks through the crowd) Genie!
Genie: Back off, Al. This creep has a yellow sheet as long as my arm.
Aladdin: Genie, meet my dad.
Genie: Stand down boys, smoke 'em if you got 'em. (The other Genies disappear. Genie approaches Cassim) If you're Al's dad, and the King of Thieves, I just wanna know one thing.
Cassim: Yeah?
Genie: (Wearing a tuxedo and a bow tie) Will you be having the chicken or the sea bass?
Aladdin: Come on, Dad. I can't wait for you to meet Jasmine and the Sultan.
Genie: Ahem, Al? (Genie stops him) Don't you think we should lose the 'Agrabah's Most Wanted' look? (Genie pulls down a poster reading "Agrabah's Most Wanted." Cassim's head is in the place of the picture.)
Cassim (Shaking the poster away from him): What's wrong with the way I look?
Aladdin: When you're here, you're not the King of Thieves. (Aladdin pulls down Cassim's mask) You're my dad.
Cassim: (Pulling the cloak away from his head) I've had more practice being the King of Thieves...
Genie: Oh, Come on, enough of this dark past. Let's roll out something a little new.
<br/>
FATHER AND SON
Genie: It's a big, bright, beautiful future.
(Genie is in the sky as a constellation.)
Thank your lucky stars you're alive
You've got someone special to talk to
(Genie turns in to Siamese twins)
A friend that you can trust for life
You've been on your own with no family ties
(Genie makes a tie appear)
But those solo days are done
You'll be two of a kind, spending quality time together
(Genie wraps the tie around Cassim and Aladdin)
As father and son.
(Genie appears on a ship)
Building model ships
(Genie flies by, riding a fish)
Takin' fishing trips
Working hand in hand
(A paint can appears in Cassim's hand. Aladdin is pushing a lawnmower)
Painting the palace, mowing the sand
(Cassim and Aladdin appear on a football field)
First and ten to go, with your daddy o.
Once you break the ice
(Genie hits the football field with a hammer. It falls away into blocks of ice. Aladdin and Cassim land in a spaceship, driven by Genie.)
You could postulate paternal advice
(Aladdin and Cassim are dropped out of the spaceship. They fly by Genie, dressed as Albert Einstein.)
I see you're traveling at the speed of life. That's the theory of relatives.
It's fine, fantabulous future
(Cassim drops, but is caught on the branch of a tree. Genie is the tree.)
I see fruit on the family tree
You'll be great as a grumpy old grandpa
(Three Genie babies appear on Cassim's knee)
Bouncing babies on your knee
(Genie turns into a basket ball.)
You could fall asleep on the comfy couch, after playing one on one.
(The three play basketball. Aladdin stands on Cassim's shoulders to make a dunk. Genie pouts)
Dreaming back to back that you walloped the Shaq
Together, as father and son.
(Cassim and Aladdin are driving bumper cars)
Cassim: May be a bumpy ride
Aladdin: We'll make it side by side
(Cassim and Aladdin are dropped into a roller coaster. Genie, dressed as a blonde woman, drops the safety bar)
Genie: Good afternoon, I'll be your travel guide
Move over laddy make room for daddy
(Cassim is standing on Genie's shoulder)
Got a whole new shoulder to cry on
Take a chance now, give it a spin
(Genie cuts up some paper. He unfolds it, to reveal the shapes of the forty thieves)
You've had chums for paling around with
(Genie folds the paper up. He unfolds it again, this time it is a cut out of Aladdin)
But you've never had a friend like him
(Genie is a mob don at a restaurant)
Put your checkered past behind you now
(Police sirens go off. Cassim runs)
No more living on the run
(The Brady Bunch opening screen appears, with Aladdin as the top middle square and Cassim as the bottom middle square. Genie appears in the other squares)
Face the big, bright, beautiful future together, together, together, together...
(Genie unfolds his hands. Cassim is now dressed in a blue robe with a red shirt)
As father and son...
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Throne Room)
(Cassim bows before Jasmine)
Cassim: My boy Aladdin must have been born under a lucky star to find such a treasure.
(Cassim stands and smiles at Jasmine.)
Jasmine: You are most definitely Aladdin's father.
(A DNA strand appears in Genie's hand)
Genie: I have the DNA to prove it.
Sultan: It must have been dreadful, trapped by the Forty Thieves!
Genie: Uh oh...
Cassim: I try to block out the memories...
Sultan: Say no more, not another word on the subject!
Cassim: Yes, let's turn our attention to happier thoughts. The blessed union of our children! (Cassim picks the Sultan up and hugs him.)
Sultan: Indeed...
Aladdin: It worked Genie! They love 'im!
Genie: (Genie takes off his scalp) It's the hat. Nothing does the trick like a smart chapeau
Cassim: Ah, back among civilized people, back among family...
Aladdin: It's more than that. All he needed was a second chance.
Cassim: ...It's a miracle.
<br/>
(Setting: Palace of Agrabah, Dungeon)
(Several thieves are behind bars. A peephole in a wooden door allows them to yell at their betrayer)
Thieves: You'll pay for this! You sold us out!
(Sa'luk slams the door of the hole shut.)
Thief: Ow! He got my nose...
Sa'luk: He's not in there!
(Sa'luk violently opens the door of the next room, where Rasoul, Hakim, and Fazal wait.)
Sa'luk: You didn't capture the King of Thieves?
Rasoul: Because he was not at the hideout.
Sa'luk: He had to be there, where else would he be?
(A young guard steps into the room)
Guard: Apologizes, Captain Rasoul...
Rasoul and Sa'luk: (Yelling) What?
Guard: Well, The Sultan said he won't be able to sentence your prisoners until tomorrow...
Rasoul: What's more important than sentencing my prisoners?
Guard: Why the wedding! Princess Jasmine and Aladdin are finally getting married!
Sa'luk: Aladdin? (Sa'luk grabs the young guard by the shirt) You didn't capture Aladdin with the others? (Sa'luk throws the guard on the ground)
Rasoul: Why would he be with the Forty Thieves?
Sa'luk: Because his father is the King of Thieves!
(Rasoul smiles)
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Hallway)
(Sultan and Jasmine are in the hallway together; Jasmine wearing her wedding dress. Sultan is pacing around the room.)
Sultan: Oh, where could he be? I do hope nothing's wrong. Perhaps we should dispatch a search party?
(Jasmine stops her father's pacing.)
Jasmine: Now father, I'm sure he's... on his way.
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Wedding Pavilion)
(Aladdin and Genie are standing in the wedding pavilion together.)
Aladdin: Where is he?
(Genie turns into Pumbaa from "<a href="/wiki/The_Lion_King" title="The Lion King">The Lion King</a>")
Genie: Hakuna Matata! (Genie changes back to normal) Whoa... I was having an out of movie experience. My guess is he wants to make an entrance.
(Setting: Outside the Royal Treasury)
(Iago is looking inside the Royal Treasury, where the Oracle waits. Iago turns to Cassim.)
Iago: Here's the monkey's lock picks. You know how to use 'em?
(Iago drops the lock pick into Cassim's hand.)
Cassim: I promise you bird, after this, I go straight.
(Rasoul steps out from behind a sarcophagus)
Rasoul: Straight to the dungeon!
Iago: Ah!
(Cassim pulls a golden sword out from the pile of treasure.)
Rasoul: We've been expecting you!
(From all corners of the room, guards step out with bows and arrows. Cassim throws the sword aside. The guards approach him.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Wedding Pavilion)
Jasmine: Do you think something is wrong?
Aladdin: Genie, can you find him?
Genie: I'll sniff him out. (Genie turns in to Pluto and begins sniffing around) I need a scrap of his clothes or a lock of his hair... (Genie smells a shoe that is in his path) Or shoe, a shoe's good...
(Genie looks up and sees that the shoe belongs to Cassim. Genie gasps. Rasoul is holding a handcuffed Cassim.)
Aladdin: Huh?
Sultan: Rasoul, what is the meaning of this?
Rasoul: (Rasoul pushes Cassim toward the Sultan) Your majesty, meet the King of Thieves.
Aladdin: Dad!
(Aladdin tries to confront Cassim, but guards hold him back. Cassim is surprised by his son's compassion)
Rasoul: We seized him in the Treasury. He was after this... (shows the Oracle) ...again.
Aladdin: (in disbelief) No...
Rasoul: And this is his accomplice.
(Nahbi reveals Iago, trapped in a cuff.)
Iago: Big misunderstanding! It's a slap on the wrist and, uh, community service kinda thing!
Aladdin: Now I know why you really came back...
(Cassim hangs his head)
Sultan: Your father is the leader of the Forty Thieves? This is most... ooh!
Jasmine: Aladdin, did you know?
Aladdin: I thought I could change him, I had to try!
Cassim: You can change my clothes Aladdin, you can't change who I am.
Rasoul: And the law is crystal clear on what we must now do!
Jasmine: (Puts her hand on Sultan's shoulder) Father, isn't there another way?
Sultan: I'm afraid there is not. Take the prisoners to the dungeon.
Iago: Dungeon?
Sultan: For life.
Iago: Life?
(Nahbi puts a cuff over Iago's beak. Cassim and Iago are led away)
Genie: (To Aladdin) There's some wishes that even I can't make come true...
<br/>
(Setting: Agrabah, Aladdin's Hovel)
Aladdin: The Oracle was right. My dad was trapped in the world of the Forty Thieves. Trapped by his own greed. I was so stupid to think I could change him.
Genie: Trying to show him a better life wasn't stupid, Al. (Using his fist as a puppet) Leaving him alone with the parrot, that was stupid.
Aladdin: Everything was perfect before he came into my life. I just want things the way they were. Genie, I need my father's clothes.
Genie: A-A-Al, what did you wrap the turban too tight? (Genie makes a twisty motion with his fingers) Come on, why would you want to dress in the 'King of Thieves' ensemble?
(Cassim's blue outfit appears. Aladdin takes it)
Genie: Might I suggest something that doesn't actually say (Wearing a prison uniform) "Arrest me!"?
Aladdin: (Wearing Cassim's outfit) It fits. Good.
Genie (As the Oracle): I'm seeing, I'm seeing... (Genie changes back to normal) nothing for your future if you dress like this!
Aladdin: I'm breaking my father out of the dungeon. The guards'll never know I was there. Tonight, the King of Thieves will make his most miraculous escape ever... out of my life. (He leaves)
Genie: It's the cape talking, isn't it?
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; Dungeon)
(Cassim and Iago are sitting in the dungeon. Cassim looks upset. Iago, still wearing a cuff over his beak, looks annoyed.)
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah, Guard's Quarters)
(Hakim and Fazal are walking down a hall. Aladdin is pressed up against the wall. Hakim and Fazal walk by him, not seeing him)
Fazal: Since he's captured the King of Thieves, there's no living with Rasoul.
Hakim: Well, it wasn't exactly easy living with him before.
(Aladdin sneaks up behind Fazal and steals his keys. Fazal turns around, sees no one behind him, and continues down the hall.)
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah, the Dungeon)
(Cassim is sitting in the dungeon. He sees someone coming through the door. Cassim stands up.)
Cassim: Who?
Aladdin: I've come to say goodbye (Aladdin begins unlocking Cassim's chains)
Cassim: Why are you...?
Aladdin: We don't have much time. While the guards chase me, you get out. (Aladdin takes the cuffs off Cassim's wrists)
Cassim: I can't let you...
Aladdin: (Throwing the keys to Cassim) Forget it. They can't catch me.
Cassim: He even sounds like me...
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah, the Guard's Quarters)
(Hakim and Fazal are sitting at a table. Rasoul is looking in the mirror, slicking back his hair.)
Rasoul: When the Sultan gives me my due, I'll put the good word in for you, the little people who... (Rasoul sees Aladdin's reflection in the mirror) It can't be. (Hakim, Fazal, and Rasoul go into the hallway.) He was here, I know it.
(Aladdin, pressed up against the ceiling, jumps down on top of Rasoul's head. He bounces off, and stands in front of Hakim and Fazal)
Fazal: The King of Thieves!
Hakim: No man can escape that cell!
Fazal: He isn't a man I say, he's a demon!
(Aladdin runs away)
Rasoul: I want him, dead or alive!
(Setting: Agrabah, The Marketplace)
(Groups of guards are running around in the city.)
Rasoul: Surround the block! He's close... I can feel it.
Guards: Which way did he go? I don't see him! Look over that way, hurry!
(Aladdin is hiding in an alley. As the guards approach him, he climbs up onto the roof of a building. Hakim and Fazal come down the same alley.)
Fazal (Pointing upward): There, the King of Thieves, on the roof!
Rasoul: Get up there, now, now, now!
(Aladdin sees Hakim, Fazal, and other guards coming up the roof.)
Fazal: Found him!
(Aladdin jumps off the roof)
Hakim: Lost him.
(Aladdin lands on a canopy, and bounces onto a wall hanging on the palace. He climbs up)
Guards: (Hanging over the edge of the roof, searching for Aladdin) Which way did he go? I heard him over there... no over there, over there!
(Aladdin jumps from a higher level of the palace and onto the bridge. Rasoul grabs his cape.)
Rasoul: Gotcha. (Aladdin falls) The King of Thieves. Your charmed life is over, your majesty! (Rasoul tries to stab Aladdin, but Aladdin pulls away. The cape rips, revealing Aladdin's true identity) You?
Aladdin: Yes.
Rasoul: Then, I guess I'll have to settle for the Prince of Thieves. We shall see if the Sultan wants you in his family now.
(Rasoul is tackled. He hits his head against the wall and is knocked out. Aladdin sees that Cassim attacked him.)
Cassim: Keep your hands off my son!
Aladdin: Dad?
Cassim: Hurry son, we must move!
(Cassim and Aladdin run off.)
<br/>
(Setting: The Desert)
(On horseback, Aladdin and Cassim ride up a hill. They run into a cavern.)
Aladdin: Did we lose 'em?
Iago (Hanging off the side of Cassim's horse): I don't know, but I did lose my lunch back there...
Cassim: They won't be able to pick up our trail until daylight. By then, we'll be long gone from Agrabah. (Aladdin looks back at the Palace of Agrabah) I'm sorry for what you lost, but you can't go back now, you know that. (Aladdin gets off his horse) What are you doing?
Aladdin: I'm not going with you... I can't.
Cassim: Well, you can't go back! The moment they saw your face your life in Agrabah was over.
Aladdin: I have to go back. Jasmine is there.
Iago: Kid, it's over, you're a criminal now.
Aladdin: I won't do what he did, I won't run away.
(Cassim gets off his horse)
Cassim: (Approaching Aladdin) I never ran away from anything in my life!
Aladdin: You ran away from your family!
Cassim: I told you what happened. What else could I do, what else can you do?
Aladdin: The right thing. You should take this back. (Aladdin throws the Midas Dagger at Cassim).
Cassim: You can't!
Aladdin: I won't walk out on Jasmine!
Cassim: Aladdin...
Aladdin: I'm your son, but I can't live your life.
Iago: Al, they'll lock you up!
Aladdin: If there's a punishment, I'll take it.
Cassim: So be it...
Iago: (Landing on Aladdin's shoulder) We have the Oracle, the treasure's just waitin' for us!
Aladdin: The Oracle?
Cassim: I had nothing left to lose!
Aladdin: Yes, you did.
(Aladdin rides off.)
Iago: It was supposed to be a father son outing.
Aladdin: (Aladdin takes Iago off his shoulder) Go with him, Iago.
Iago: What? Ya mean it? Really?
Aladdin: Go! (Aladdin gestures Iago toward Cassim)
Iago: (Iago salutes Aladdin) Good luck, kid...
(Cassim and Iago ride into the desert. Aladdin heads back to Agrabah)
<br/>
(Setting: Forty Thieves Lair)
Fat White Man: The Forty Thieves down to seven. What are we to do?
Skinny, White Man: How did they find us? How did they learn the magic words? (The ground starts shaking) Another raid?
Triplets: Not again!
Fat, Asian Man: (Standing and karate chopping) It is a good day to die!
Sa'luk: (From the entrance) Or to come back from the dead!
Fat, White Man: Sa'luk?
Triplets: You're alive?
Skinny, Green Man: Impossible...
Sa'luk: I'm a survivor, like all of you. (Sa'luk puts his claws on) No thanks to Cassim.
Skinny, White Man: The King?
Fat, Asian Man: You saw him?
Fat, White Man: What's he want us to do now?
Sa'luk: He wants you to rot in the palace dungeon!
Triplets: (The triplets stand on top of each other) Bah... the King of Thieves is loyal to the end!
Sa'luk: (Sa'luk knocks them over) Pushovers!
Triplets: Ouch...
Sa'luk: He betrayed you, sold you out.
Fat, Asian Man: You have always hated the King. Why should we believe you?
Sa'luk: How do you think the guard got the magic words?
Fat, White Man: He told him the magic words?
Triplets: I don't believe it!
Fat, White Man: Me neither!
Sa'luk: Ha! Ha! You have forgotten what life was like before Cassim.
<br/>
IN OR OUT?
Sa'luk: I remember a time when crime was sublime
There was plenty of loot in the lair.
(Sa'luk destroys various goblets and cups. The thieves are angry.)
We'd plunder and pillage and ransack a village
With nary a worry or care
Then along came this king with his soft hearted dream
(Sa'luk slices a picture of Cassim)
But he ratted us out in the end!
So rally the troops, we were meant to regroup.
And return to our roots once again.
Are you in or out?
Gotta know without a doubt
(The thieves approach Sa'luk, holding their weapons to him. Sa'luk easily punches them away)
I'm the one you need for a dirty deed
I'm the best, success is guaranteed
Are you men or mice?
(Sa'luk knocks the Triplets out of the way and into a tent.)
Take a slice of my advice
You want a fearless leader, one that's strong and stout?
(Sa'luk cuts through the tent. The Triplets are scared)
Better vote for me
Are you in or out?
(Sa'luk destroys the rest of the thieves. They sit up, rubbing their heads)
Fat, Asian Man: We used to be smart
Skinny, Green Man: Yes, horrendously heartless
Skinny, White Man: In a ravaging raid we were rough!
Triplets: We knew that we had to be blissfully bad
Then Cassim brought this sensitive stuff!
Thieves: And we strayed from the path of our rigorous wrath.
Now we're taking a bath in the dust!
But we'll reclaim our winnings, our humble beginnings
In turmoil and torture, we trust!
Are you in or out?
Sa'luk: Double crossers or devout?
Put your faith in me, pretty soon you'll see
I'm the prince of generosity!
Thieves: Are you foe or friend?
(The thieves make a pathway out of torches)
Sa'luk: Here's the path I recommend
You wanna ride to fame, I've got the fastest route
What's it gonna be?
Are you in or out?
(The thieves prepare their weapons)
Skinny, White Man: We'll go robbing in all the right places
Triplets: From Agrabah dunes to Bali
Skinny, Green Man: Imagine the fear on their faces
Fat, White Man: When we drop by for cookies and tea...
Sa'luk: Come along boys, follow me!
Are you in or out?
If you're with me, give a shout
Thieves: Yah!
Sa'luk: I'll lead you all the way into the glory days
Thieves: We'll begin a life of crime that pays (Omid wedgies Behrang and grabs the bag of money from his pants)
Triplet: Are you out or in?
Triplet 2: Make your choice now, sink or swim?
Sa'luk: You can stick with me, or stay behind and pout
Thieves: What's it gonna be?
Sa'luk: Consider carefully
Thieves: Are you in or out?
<br/>
(Setting: Outside the Forty Thieves' Lair)
Iago: I know the treasure's limitless. But I'm not crazy about a forty way split. If it was just uh, you and me...
Cassim: I would never cut my men out of the deal. They're my family, my only family. I can always count on them.
(Cassim and Iago enter the lair.)
Cassim: I'm home!
(From the sides of the lair, the remaining thieves emerge. They are holding their weapons out to Cassim. Cassim backs up as far as he can.)
Iago: Why don't they look happy to see you?
Sa'luk: (Emerging from the crowd) We are, we're thrilled! (Sa'luk holds his claws out to Cassim)
<br/>
(Setting: A Boat)
(Cassim and Iago are tied to the mast of a boat)
Cassim: Hurry, little friend.
Iago: I'm wriggling, I'm wriggling.
Sa'luk: I am growing impatient, Cassim. Ask the question.
Cassim: We must be ah...
Iago: Just a little further...
Cassim: Further out to sea...
Sa'luk: No, ask it now!
Iago: (Almost free) Now's good.
Cassim: Where can we find the Hand of Midas?
(The Oracle appears in the sky, while Iago frees himself).
Oracle: The Vanishing Isle will appear at dawn. I will show you the way... (A trail of light appears in the water)
Cassim: There's your setting, captain.
(Iago flies away)
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah)
Sultan: Frankly, my boy, your actions were most disappointing.
Rasoul: It is tragic your highness, but the street rat has obviously followed in his father's footsteps. Aladdin is a criminal.
(Genie appears, dressed as a lawyer)
Genie: I object, your honor. (Genie turns the setting into a courtroom, with Sultan as the judge and Rasoul as the bailiff) I object to that outrageous statement. And I object to a tertiary character having any lines during my big courtroom scene. (Genie hands Rasoul a briefcase) Take this to a higher court, chow! (Genie blasts Rasoul out of the scene) Your honor, if I may enter a plea of insanity, because I'm crazy about this kid! (Genie messes up Aladdin's hair)
Aladdin: (Pushes Genie away) Genie, I can handle this myself. Sultan, I convinced my father to come here. It was my fault. I would've been better off if I'd never known him.
Jasmine: Aladdin, you found your father. A father who risked his freedom to see your wedding. And you risked everything to save him. Just as I would for my father.
Sultan: Your father? (Softening) Well... well yes... Aladdin, I could not overlook your father's crimes, but what you have done, well, you did it out of love. And you came back to take responsibility for your actions. Let us put this matter behind us. I believe we have postponed the wedding long enough.
Genie: Okay, good call! Let's give a big hand for the wise and generous Sultan! (Sultan is led away by two large Genie hands)
(Iago's scream is heard. Iago falls from the sky, bouncing off Carpet. Jasmine catches him.)
Iago: Al's dad... Sa'luk...
Jasmine: Just take a deep breath, Iago. Now what about Aladdin's father?
Iago: It's Sa'luk, the guy Al beat. He's not beat, he's back. And he's got Cassim.
Aladdin: (Turning away from Iago) That's his problem. He chose to go back to that life...
Genie: Al, your dad's made a lot of bad choices, but that doesn't mean you have to.
Jasmine: He is your father, how can you do anything else?
Aladdin: I'm being as stubborn as he was... (To Iago) Show me the way!
(Iago sighs)
<br/>
(Setting: The Boat, Dawn)
Oracle: You have arrived.
(The Earth moves, but nothing appears)
Fat, White Man: Where is it?
Fat, Asian Man: I see nothing. Nothing but fog!
Sa'luk: (Holding his claws out to Cassim) I've had enough of your trickery!
Cassim: No! This is it. The Vanishing Isle. Watch.
(From under the water, a castle raises. The ship is nearly knocked over. The castle is on top of a floating turtle.)
(Setting: The Air)
(Aladdin and company fly in on Carpet)
Aladdin: The Vanishing Isle!
Jasmine: On the back of a giant turtle.
Aladdin: And never in the same place twice. Let's get closer.
<br/>
(Carpet flies in closer to the Isle. Cassim, in chains, is being led by Sa'luk.)
Genie: (Dropping in on a parachute, dressed as Rambo) Prepare to rock and roll, dudes!
(Genie lands on the ground and shoots some lasers toward some the thieves. Jasmine, Abu, and Carpet block the thieves' way. The thieves laugh, but are pushed back by Abu's jumping, Jasmine's punching, and Carpet's flying.)
Genie: (As a monk) I am here, (Genie, still as a monk, appears on the other side of the thieves) I am here.
(Jasmine pushes a griffin statue down upon the thieves. The fat, white thief continues to walk.)
Genie: (As a hillbilly) How 'bout a packet of Nutty Buddies? (Genie pushes the thief back with his stomach)
Aladdin: Genie, we need a distraction.
Genie: Survey says: Show me turtle! (Genie flies to the turtle. He is dressed as a wrestler) Boom! Another fake blow to the head. Boom! (As a wrestling announcer) Oh no! He's got'em in the half nelson. Now he's got'em in the full nelson. Oh no, the dreaded Ozzie Nelson! (As Ozzie Nelson) Rick, boys, maybe you want to come over here and see what's happening? (As the wrestling announcer, moving toward the turtle's mouth) He's coming in quick. Oh no, he's up, he's down, and he's actually inside the turtle! We'll be right back after a brief message. (Genie is now inside the turtle) Tickle, tickle, tickle!
(The turtle's pupils shrink. The ground starts to shake. Cassim and Sa'luk, still walking together, nearly lose their balance. Aladdin jumps down from a high ledge and dropkicks Sa'luk. Sa'luk gets back up. Aladdin uppercuts him, knocking Sa'luk unconscious.)
Aladdin: It took me years to find my father. I'm not losing him again!
Cassim: You came to help me? (Aladdin frees him)
Aladdin: How could I do anything else? Now let's get that treasure of yours.
(Cassim and Aladdin enter the main cavern of the room)
Cassim: Amazing. (Cassim points upward) There! (A giant golden hand is floating in the sky)
(The cavern shakes.)
Aladdin: Whoa! Feels like Genie got carried away!
Cassim: No! It's the Vanishing Isle! The turtle is diving! We must climb higher!
(Aladdin sees water rushing into the cavern. He and Cassim run to the wall and start climbing. Water is coming from all sides. Outside the cavern, Sa'luk wakes.)
Cassim: Almost there! Can't you see Aladdin? We were meant to do this together! Come on!
(Sa'luk smiles and enters the cavern. Cassim and Aladdin reach the level of the floating golden hand. On the floating hand is a statue, holding the Hand of Midas. Cassim holds back a tear.)
Cassim: Pity I didn't find this place years ago. This would be much easier if I were much younger. (Cassim gets ready to jump to the floating hand. Aladdin jumps toward the hand) Aladdin!
(Aladdin barely makes it to the hand; he is hanging off the edge. Aladdin pulls himself up).
Aladdin: See, it pays to have a junior partner!
Cassim: Be careful! Don't touch the golden hand.
Aladdin: (Aladdin pulls on the Hand. It doesn't move. Aladdin turns it, and picks it up.) Heads up! (Aladdin throws the Hand to Cassim. Cassim catches it in his cape. It turns to gold.)
Cassim: Ha ha! The Hand of Midas! (Cassim touches the base of the cavern with the hand. The entire cavern turns to solid gold.) Time to go, Aladdin!
(Sa'luk jumps down from an upper level, tackling Aladdin)
Sa'luk: Nobody's going anywhere. Give the Hand of Midas to me, Cassim, or your son dies.
Cassim: Sa'luk, your battle is with me!
Aladdin: Don't worry, Dad, I can take 'em alone.
Cassim: But you're not alone. Not anymore. You want the Hand of Midas, Sa'luk? Take it! (Cassim throws the Hand of Midas to Sa'luk)
Sa'luk: (Sa'luk catches the Hand) The Hand of Midas is mine! And also, the life of your brat. (To Aladdin) What are you staring at? (Sa'luk realizes that he caught the Hand of Midas by the golden part. He drops it.) no... no... No... NO... Ahhhh! (Aladdin winces as Sa'luk turns into a golden statue and falls into the sea. The water in the cavern has risen to the point where the floating hand is floating on top of the water. Aladdin takes the Hand of Midas and wraps his ripped off sleeve around it, turning it to gold.)
Cassim: Hurry, son! We're running out of time.
(Aladdin puts the Hand of Midas in his belt and swims to the edge of the cavern, and he and Cassim start climbing up the cliff face. Cassim falls behind.)
Aladdin: Come on, Dad. You can do it!
Cassim: Yes. But it would be a lot easier without this. (takes off the golden cape and drops it into the water.)
(Cassim and Aladdin make it to the top of the cavern and into the sunlight. Cassim takes a deep breath. Aladdin takes out the Hand of Midas and unwraps it)
Aladdin: (Handing the Hand to Cassim) After all these years, you finally have your treasure.
Cassim: This thing? No. This retched thing almost cost me the Ultimate Treasure. It's you, son. You are my Ultimate Treasure. (hugs Aladdin) I'm just sorry it took me this long to realize it. The Hand of Midas can take its curse to the bottom of the sea! (throws the Hand of Midas over the edge of the island. It lands on the boat below, where the seven thieves are waiting to leave)
Fat, White Man: It's gold. It's turned everything to solid gold!
(The ship turns to solid gold. It sinks)
Skinny, White Man: We are sinking!
(Iago, Jasmine, Abu, and Carpet are sitting on a pillar.)
Iago: I didn't see where they went it, they could be anywhere!
Jasmine: (Pointing to the top of the island) There they are!
(Cassim and Aladdin jump off the top of the island.)
Cassim: Get up here you blasted rug!
(Carpet flies up and catches them.)
Aladdin: You actually trust this thing?
Cassim: With my life, son.
(Carpet picks up the others. As they fly away, the island sinks.)
Aladdin: Genie?
(The turtle raises his head to take one last breath. Genie, as Steamboat Willie, comes out, whistling.)
Aladdin: Genie?
Genie: (Appears beside Carpet) Present!
Aladdin: Let's go home. We have some unfinished business.
<br/>
(Setting: The Palace of Agrabah; The Wedding Pavilion)
(Aladdin and Jasmine are standing in front of candles. Aladdin and Jasmine kiss. Genie shoots off some fireworks.)
Sultan: Yes!
(Genie starts to cry again. He grabs Carpet to blow his nose, but Carpet hands him a tissue. Jasmine and Aladdin walk up the aisle, Rajah carrying the train of Jasmine's dress. Aladdin looks around the wedding chapel. He sees Cassim leaning against a pillar. Cassim nods toward Aladdin, and turns around. Iago is behind him.)
Iago: Out in the open? No mask? Pretty risky if you ask me.
Cassim: Even a wanted man can risk a bit to see his own son's wedding. (He gets down on one knee in front of Iago) So, you little turkey, come to say goodbye?
Iago: Nah, I already said my goodbyes. Of course, the monkey had a cry, and that got me goin'... (Iago wipes a tear away from his eye)
Cassim: You're not going to live in the palace?
Iago: With the newly weds? (Cassim jumps off the edge of the pavilion, and lands on top of his horse) It'll be too lovey dovey! I just as soon keep my will to live.
Cassim: Well, I don't know where I'm going, but you're welcome to come along for the ride.
Iago: (Iago lands on Cassim's shoulder) You're a good guy, Cassim, but not good. Ha Ha! (Cassim and Iago ride off).
<br/>
ARABIAN NIGHTS (REPRISE)
(Jasmine and Aladdin come out of the palace.)
Merchant: So it goes short and sweet
They were wed down the street
(Jasmine throws her bouquet into the crowd. Four Genies appear in dresses, reaching to catch it. They move as it comes near them, and Rasoul catches it.)
May their marriage be truly blessed
Happy end to the tale
And tomorrow's a sale
So I'd better go home and rest
Here's a kiss and a hug
Sure you don't need a rug?
I assure the price is right
(The Merchant from "Aladdin" offers to sell Aladdin and Jasmine a rug and a plate with their faces on it. They shake their heads and fly off)
Well, salaam worthy friend
Come back soon, that's the end
(Aladdin grabs Jasmine to give her a passionate kiss, but Jasmine kisses him softly.)
Till another Arabian Night.
(Cassim and Iago ride into the moonlight.)
(Post-credits scene)
Genie: Wait a minute. WE'RE NOT GETTING OUTTA HERE, MAN! WE'RE NOT GETTING OUTTA HERE! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND IT, MAN?! THIS IS IT, GAME'S OVER, MAN!
(Genie smiles embarrassedly at the camera, and flies off.)
