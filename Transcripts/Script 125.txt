We're running out of time.
<br/>
We have polluted and peopled this planet
to the brink of extinction.
<br/>
We are destroying our world
at a suicidal pace.
<br/>
We need a pollution revolution.
<br/>
And it's not going to be easy
because the world is addicted to petroIeum.
<br/>
We have limited resources
and we go to war to protect them.
<br/>
We need a new technology,
and this technology can't be sold.
<br/>
It must be given away - to everyone.
<br/>
We are in sight of a dream.
<br/>
There is a solution.
<br/>
The answer is aIl around us.
It's right here.
<br/>
Water. H2O.
Two parts hydrogen, one part oxygen.
<br/>
There is enough energy
in this glass of water
<br/>
to power the city of Chicago for weeks.
<br/>
It's the hydrogen we're after.
<br/>
This is what happens when we burn it.
<br/>
It's perfectIy cIean.
<br/>
And you can burn it when you want to,
in a car, in a turbine,
<br/>
or in your own basement power supply
next to your water heater.
<br/>
But what if we could release
this energy efficiently?
<br/>
We will transform the world.
<br/>
Maybe we start to put an end to war.
<br/>
Of course, we have to make it work first.
<br/>
(woman) Morning!
<br/>
- Hey, James, how are you doing?
- Hey, Eddie, cold enough for you?
<br/>
It's never too cold.
<br/>
Hey, Lu! You want me to set up?
<br/>
Yeah, right away.
<br/>
- Hello, Mr Shannon.
- Mr Shannon, the big man, how are you?
<br/>
- Alistair.
- Did you have a good trip?
<br/>
Very good, thank you.
Hi, young feIla.
<br/>
- Can I get you some coffee?
- I'm fine, thank you.
<br/>
I turn on the laser here. We should
focus it in the centre of the bubbIe.
<br/>
- How's it going?
- You didn't get my fax?
<br/>
I did. I just didn't understand all the figures.
<br/>
- (Lu) We need to control the bubble.
- The regulator still isn't working.
<br/>
Eddie, did you computer-model
your work last night?
<br/>
No, I was too busy building it.
<br/>
We sustained fusion for 4.6 miIliseconds.
<br/>
StabIe?
<br/>
It's stable... for 4.6 milliseconds.
<br/>
Let me show you. Come, come.
<br/>
(Lu) The power input and output
is fine at this stage.
<br/>
The output drops to nothing
at stage three, so what happened?
<br/>
- Paul!
- Yeah, OK.
<br/>
I gotta go.
<br/>
Cross your fingers, everyone.
<br/>
Good luck.
<br/>
(Alistair) Mr Chen. Initiate laser.
<br/>
(Lu) Initiate laser.
<br/>
(woman) Hydrogen separation in progress.
<br/>
(Lu) Initiate hydrogen burn.
<br/>
(man) Two million kelvin and rising.
<br/>
Shut it down!
It's unstable. Shut it down.
<br/>
We learned something important today.
We found another way that didn't work.
<br/>
We need to keep our minds open
and try again.
<br/>
(metallic buzzing)
<br/>
(buzzing stops)
<br/>
(metallic buzzing)
<br/>
Alistair.
<br/>
- It's working.
- Is it stable?
<br/>
Yeah, it's stable.
<br/>
- CompIeteIy stable.
- My God!
<br/>
- We go tomorrow.
- Tomorrow, Alistair.
<br/>
LiIy, taIk to me.
<br/>
Temperature, gas flow,
acoustic drive steadied.
<br/>
- The regulator has stabilised the reaction.
- Lucasz.
<br/>
My spectrometer shows
stabIe hydrogen production.
<br/>
We're getting more out than we put in.
<br/>
I think you'd better sell your utility stocks.
<br/>
- Whoa, Mr Chidi!
- Unbelievable!
<br/>
- You're going to be famous.
- Thanks for everything.
<br/>
- We want more money now!
- Thanks for your trust.

Oh, yes, please!

- Uh-huh.
<br/>
We've got a better chance

Mr Chen, upload everything.
<br/>
I want it on the Internet tonight.

We'll wake up a lot of people.

Damn right. Really wake 'em up.

- This is Alistair's house.
<br/>
Isn't he sweet?
He lets me live on the third floor.
<br/>
Mmm. This... way.
<br/>
Is this... is this what drunk is?
<br/>
You've never been drunk?
<br/>
I've never been this.

<br/>
Alistair!
<br/>

<br/>
Get ready.
<br/>
(rapid bleeping)
<br/>
(phone rings)
<br/>
- Shannon.
- Paul? Alistair's dead.
<br/>
- Eddie?
- I found him on the lab floor.
<br/>
- He was murdered.
- What?
<br/>
(police radios)
<br/>
(man) Just what caused the expIosion
Iast night is stilI unclear.
<br/>
University officiaIs say
this mill site had been converted
<br/>
for the experimental production
of hydrogen fuel.
<br/>
They say that's not supposed
to be dangerous.
<br/>
One question Iaw enforcement officials
are trying to determine
<br/>
is whether foul pIay was invoIved.
<br/>
As we indicate, that's unconfirmed.
<br/>
But an FBI agent has said, and it was
reported by a Bureau spokesperson,
<br/>
that no nuclear device went off.
There was no atomic explosion.
<br/>
As far as you know,
are alI your people accounted for?
<br/>
Miss Sinclair? Is this all the group?
<br/>
Alistair didn't come home last night.
Lu Chen is nowhere to be found.
<br/>
I phoned him and he's not anywhere.
<br/>
I started CPR.
I checked for breath, there was no breath.
<br/>
I checked and there was no pulse.
I continued with the CPR.
<br/>
Have the locals move
the perimeter back about 1,000 ft.
<br/>
- You got it.
- Find me a friendIy Federal judge.
<br/>
I want wiretap orders, search warrants
on everyone that worked here.
<br/>
Inspector Ford, you've taken
charge of this investigation.
<br/>
Why is the FBI involved?
<br/>
Eight city bIocks disappeared.
The President talked to my boss at 3am.
<br/>
He wants answers.
<br/>
TelI me about Eddie.
Does he drink, do drugs?
<br/>
No. He's just a machinist,
an undergraduate working to get his degree.
<br/>
That's the undisclosed cost
of our cheap fossil fuel.
<br/>
Who'd be interested in this?
<br/>
Cheap, clean, abundant energy?
<br/>
Who wouldn't?
<br/>
- When you left the party, who was there?
- Eddie.
<br/>
So, Eddie, telI us again why you came back?
<br/>
I'd come back for my bike.
<br/>
You say you'd returned
from taking Miss Sinclair home.
<br/>
That's right. Her car wouIdn't start,
so I took her home on the bus.
<br/>
What is your relationship with Miss Sinclair?
<br/>
We work together.
I'm a machinist, she's a physicist.
<br/>
I was...
<br/>
hired by Dr Chen.
<br/>
- And who is Dr Chen?
- He was Dr Barkley's project manager.
<br/>
- Why did he hire you?
- Because I'm a physicist.
<br/>
GentIemen, what have we got here?
Sergeant?
<br/>
I think we have Mr Chen in the wind.
<br/>
Nick, what did you find?
<br/>
It looks like he packed with a shoveI.
He was in a hurry.
<br/>
Dr Barkley expressed interest
in a specialist in sonoluminescence.
<br/>
He knew about Dr Chen.
<br/>
So through some friends in the State
Department, I got him here and onto the team.
<br/>
You have friends in the State Department?
<br/>
- We have influential members of the board.
- Really?
<br/>
- Who's on the board of your foundation?
- (phone)
<br/>
- Ford.
- Various scientists...
<br/>
- Yeah.
- ..and industrialists.
<br/>
Your Dr Chen is missing.
<br/>
Any idea where he might be?
<br/>
He may be dead.
<br/>
- We have no comment.
- Eddie Kasalivich! You said they killed him.
<br/>
Who killed him, Eddie?
<br/>
You were there before the explosion.
What happened?
<br/>
- What are you looking for?
- We're examining the articles on his desk.
<br/>
- How are you entitled to do that?
- Annette!
<br/>
They have a search warrant,
but no respect for a man's life.
<br/>
I want a full inventory. These are
very important, sensitive scientific papers.
<br/>
- We'll give you copies.
- Signed, please!
<br/>
For two decades, Doctor Barkley...
<br/>
(Shannon) I have to speak
to the university's IegaI counseI.
<br/>
Please give LiIy any help you can.
<br/>
I can't stay here tonight.
<br/>
(TV) Among the missing is Dr Lu Chen,
who the authorities are looking for.
<br/>
He may be considered a suspect...
<br/>
- This is insane.
- They're going to think he did it.
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
- What is it?
- It's from Dr Lu Chen.
<br/>
He wants me
to bring the rest of the information,
<br/>
alI the data and meet him
at the rendezvous in Shanghai.
<br/>
I'm being framed.
<br/>
What are you talking about?
<br/>
- This isn't from Chen.
- How do you know?
<br/>
- He doesn't write like this.
- Then who sent it?
<br/>
I don't know who sent it.
<br/>
- Where's Chen?
- You don't think he did it?
<br/>
Let's...
<br/>
Let's get outta here, OK?
<br/>
- Can I help you?
- I sure hope so.
<br/>
- We're looking for Mr Paul Shannon.
- He's on the phone right now.
<br/>
- Excuse me.
- You can't go in there!!
<br/>
- (speakerphone) There's a lot to explain.
- I'll call you back.
<br/>
- What now, Agent Ford?
- We've received Eddie Kasalivich's file.
<br/>
He left coIlege for discipIinary reasons.
He bIew the heIl out of the Iab.
<br/>
- This is a coincidence!
- You knew he was kicked out of school?
<br/>
- He resigned.
- Under some pressure?
<br/>
There was some pressure.
<br/>
- He blows up a building...
- Minor structural damage.
<br/>
It was an interesting experiment.
It might have worked.
<br/>
Didn't you think
this information was important?
<br/>
I don't see the relevance.
<br/>
- You don't see a smalI connection?
- No, Agent Ford, I don't.
<br/>
The CIA telIs me
Chen might be involved in espionage.
<br/>
KasaIivich's past makes me nervous.
<br/>
And Miss Sinclair is receiving faxes
inviting her to mainland China.
<br/>
RealIy?
<br/>
RealIy.
<br/>
What's wrong?
<br/>
That's my place.
<br/>
(Eddie) Let's get outta here.
<br/>
(siren)
<br/>
- It's a real shithole.
- How much does this guy make?
<br/>
Not much, he's a student machinist.
<br/>
- Sheen, why are you outside?
- Stay warm, buddy!
<br/>
Got a loft for your mother.
Very artistic.
<br/>
- Who's upstairs?
- Everybody. Half the city.
<br/>
- Do you want to check that cabinet?
- I got it.
<br/>
Jesus, you could put together
almost anything here.
<br/>
I want all this.
<br/>
All right! We need a total lab workup.
<br/>
It's er... a neutron cappuccino machine.
<br/>
Yeah, don't touch it.
<br/>
Hey, Nick! What's this?
<br/>
It's a transmitter.
<br/>
- It's a burst transmitter.
- What does it do?
<br/>
It sends massive amounts
of information by satellite,
<br/>
probabIy to China.
<br/>
Nick! Doyle!
<br/>
(radio) Calls flooded into
the University Of Chicago
<br/>
from all over the world,
enquiring about the professor.
<br/>
Concern came from
the Royal Academy in London,
<br/>
from Paris, Moscow
and all parts of the compass.
<br/>
But at the same time,
critics say Barkley was a Utopian dreamer.
<br/>
They point out that the research
he was involved with
<br/>
was far more dangerous
than he realised.
<br/>
(man) Paul.
<br/>
Shannon!
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
- Tell me about the money, Eddie.
- What money?
<br/>
The $250,000 the FBI found in your Ioft.
<br/>
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- What about the transmitter? Think hard.
<br/>
Jesus...
<br/>
I suppose you're not in communication
with Dr Chen in China?
<br/>
It wasn't Chen.
<br/>
- Do you have an attorney?
- No.
<br/>
I've got a good one.
<br/>
He'lI negotiate your surrender.
Come on. We'Il calI him.
<br/>
- Surrender?
- They'll want to talk to you.
<br/>
- I'm not going.
- What do you mean?
<br/>
- We didn't do anything.
- The FBI will figure that out.
<br/>
We're being set up. I'm not going
to the cops untiI I know more.
<br/>
Run, and you'lI have
every gun-carrying idiot in the US after you.
<br/>
Look, talk to this lawyer.
<br/>
We'll go somewhere safe
and wait until you work it out.
<br/>
- Where?
- Maggie's.
<br/>
We'll go to Maggie's.
<br/>
OK. Have you got any money?
<br/>
- $40.
- All right. Here.
<br/>
When you get there, stay put.
Don't use the phone. I'll call you.
<br/>
(tyres screech)
<br/>
Why is this happening, Paul?
<br/>
It's gonna be alI right, Eddie.
I promise you.
<br/>
Wait here five minutes, then leave.
<br/>
- What do we know about this Shannon?
- Illinois Institute of Technology,
<br/>
Kennedy School of Government.
Worked for several aerospace giants.
<br/>
Three years in Washington
under Reagan...
<br/>
- Oh, yeah? Doing what?
- DARPA.
<br/>
Defence Advanced Research
Project Administration.
<br/>
Jesus! Who the hell is this guy?
<br/>
He's not just someone that runs a foundation.
<br/>
There's a train at 8.40
at the Union Station to WiIliams Bay.
<br/>
- That's where Maggie lives.
- You can trust her?
<br/>
We lived and worked together.
<br/>
(TV) This is the Channel 32 special report.
<br/>
We go live to the Federal Office Building
in Chicago.
<br/>
As you know, it's been
a very long and a very trying day for us all.
<br/>
Material witness warrants have been issued
in IIlinois for Professor Lu Chen,
<br/>
Dr Lily Sinclair, and Edward Kasalivich.
<br/>
- Oh, my God!
- If anyone knows their whereabouts,
<br/>
please contact the Chicago FBI office.
<br/>
What are we going to do?
We can't leave here together.
<br/>
Get a cab outside. Buy two tickets.
Williams Bay. I'Il meet you on the track.
<br/>
- Be safe.
- You too.
<br/>
Hey, Mike, did you see that guy?
<br/>
Union Station, pIease.
<br/>
Hey! Hey, you! Come here.
<br/>
Hey! Officer!
<br/>
Hey, buddy!
<br/>
Hey, you!
<br/>
I got him! I got him!
<br/>
It makes no sense. If Kasalivich is just
a pawn, why has he got a burst transmitter?
<br/>
- What?
- He's gotta be transmitting to someone.
<br/>
- Unbelievable.
- What?
<br/>
CPD's chasing Kasalivich
down Michigan Avenue.
<br/>
Stay where you are!
<br/>
He's gonna falI! Get me a boat under there!
<br/>
What the hell's he doing?
<br/>
He's going over!
Hey! We got guys downstairs?
<br/>
- What did I tell you? He just went over.
- Stairs, over here.
<br/>
- Listen. How do we get him down?
- Officer, if I move that bridge, he's gonna falI.
<br/>
- Can he get out lower down?
- Leads down to the gear room.
<br/>
- Bring the bridge down.
- He'll get crushed.
<br/>
Ten-four. Bring it down sIow.
<br/>
- Bring the bridge down now!
- Get over there!
<br/>
Hey! What's happening? Why did it stop?
<br/>
- Right, I want this cleared.
- Let's go! Do a search!
<br/>
Move it, move it!
<br/>
Go! Go! Right now!
<br/>
You! Back this thing outta here. Come on!
<br/>
So where the helI is he?
<br/>
(announcement)
Amtrak northbound, No. 343,
<br/>
now leaving on track 19
for Fox Lake, Wallburgh, Williams Bay,
<br/>
Jamesfield and Madison.
<br/>
- God! I didn't think I was gonna make it.
- Watch your step.
<br/>
Don't worry, he'll be here.
<br/>
You were right.
<br/>
- What took you so long?
- The bridge was up.
<br/>
All aboard!
<br/>
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Are you sure
she's going to be up this late?
<br/>
Yeah, she's usually up all night.
<br/>
- She's kinda wild.
- Oh.
<br/>
- I worked up here one summer.
- Oh!
<br/>
(whirring)
<br/>
(Eddie) Maggie.
<br/>
Maggie!
<br/>
Oh, my.
<br/>
- Tell me you didn't do it, Eddie!
- I didn't do it.
<br/>
Oh, it's good to see you, man.
<br/>
- You must be the other terrorist.
- I guess I am.
<br/>
Maggie, this is LiIy.
<br/>
Hi, LiIy.
<br/>
- Have a nice trip, Mr Shannon.
- Thank you, Bobby.
<br/>
How did you get me into this hearing?
I don't have this kind of clearance.
<br/>
I know a guy that knows a guy.
<br/>
- Who?
- It's a guy.
<br/>
- Who's the guy?
- Doyle, it's national security. I can't tell you.
<br/>
Security concerns must be given
greater importance in industrial research.
<br/>
We don't know the cause of the explosion.
<br/>
And we don't know the source of
the espionage, if indeed there was espionage.
<br/>
But we do know that we are at risk.
<br/>
Every idea that offers a competitive
advantage to Americans is subject to theft.
<br/>
And that, gentlemen, couId be catastrophic.
<br/>
Mr Shannon, over the past ten years,
this committee has approved
<br/>
hundreds of millions of dollars
for your research projects
<br/>
without having one good, goddamn idea
about where the heIl aIl the money was going.
<br/>
He's talking about our tax dolIars up there.
<br/>
We were under the impression, Senator,
<br/>
that you passed Iegislation
to ensure that you wouIdn't know.
<br/>
Or perhaps, more accurately,
that you didn't want to know.
<br/>
I'm aware of the Iaw, Mr Shannon,
thank you. I wrote it.
<br/>
But I don't remember,
when I drafted it, that I anticipated
<br/>
a large portion
of the south side of Chicago bIown up.
<br/>
What assurances can you give me
and this committee
<br/>
that this event wiIl never happen again?
<br/>
None, Senator.
<br/>
The incident in Chicago was tragic,
to be sure.
<br/>
But sometimes that is the price we must pay
to ensure our competitive edge in the future.
<br/>
We didn't intend to pay for
our space exploration programme
<br/>
with the Iives of ten American astronauts.
But we did.
<br/>
NevertheIess,
we must not waver in our commitment
<br/>
to technological and scientific
research and development.
<br/>
As you gentlemen know,
there are many threats to our way of life.
<br/>
And not all of them wear uniforms
and carry guns.
<br/>
Mr Shannon, I want to thank you for
your appearance today before this committee.
<br/>
You have spoken like a true patriot
of whom this country can be very proud.
<br/>
Thank you, sir.
<br/>
(typing on computer)
<br/>
- I think I'm getting through.
- What about Lucasz?
<br/>
He never got over
not getting his credentials.
<br/>
No-one on the team couId have done this.
<br/>
Whoever is doing this
knows an awful lot about us.
<br/>
If I hadn't have shown up,
they wouId have thought it was an accident.
<br/>
And nobody would know
what's realIy going on.
<br/>
(beep)
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
- Welcome back, boss. We missed you.
- What about me?
<br/>
SurveiIlance is up on Shannon's estate.
<br/>
Cue it up, Jimmy.
<br/>
Where are the files
on the Moore Foundation?
<br/>
GentIemen, Shannon's moving.
<br/>
(loudspeaker)
There will be an orientation meeting
<br/>
in the main auditorium,
on level one, at 1400 hours.
<br/>
- Is everyone here?
- Yes.
<br/>
- Is it running?
- Not yet.
<br/>
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- FBI. I'm Agent WilIiams, this is Agent Lim.
<br/>
So, what kind of facility is this?
<br/>
I'm sorry, sir,
we're not aIlowed to discuss this.
<br/>
Good morning, Iadies and gentlemen.
Bear with me, and we'll soon get started.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
I don't care if he's got
an appointment with Mother Teresa.
<br/>
We have been waiting for him
for 35 minutes.
<br/>
You're late.
<br/>
- This is another one of your messes, Lyman.
- It's not the Peace Corps, Paul.
<br/>
- Anyway, you said you had it under control.
- I did!
<br/>
This thing's stilI not working.
<br/>
You've got to call off the Bureau.
Do you understand?
<br/>
I'm not sure I can do that.
<br/>
There's an awfuI Iot of expIaining to do.
<br/>
Where's the young man?
<br/>
KasaIivich?
<br/>
He's someplace safe.
I'm bringing him in today.
<br/>
Paul!
<br/>
If someone's going down for this,
it is not gonna be I.
<br/>
Paul Shannon, please.
<br/>
Maggie McDermott. We're old friends.
<br/>
Washington.
<br/>
Area code's Wisconsin. Checking the prefix.
<br/>
Punch it up.
<br/>
Maggie McDermott. She was
put through from the Chicago office.
<br/>
Maggie?
<br/>
Shannon, it's Eddie.
<br/>
(feedback)
<br/>
- It's scrambled.
- It's him, on a payphone in WilIiams Bay.
<br/>
I'll get the locals.
<br/>
- What are you doing?
- It's OK, it's a payphone. That phony fax...
<br/>
I know about that. Wait at Maggie's.
I'll send someone for you.
<br/>
LiIy tracked it to Beijing.
It routed through a Chinese company,
<br/>
but it came from
the US Technological Business CounciI.
<br/>
- We've gotta go.
- Heard of it?
<br/>
- They'll be there in an hour.
- Now, Eddie!
<br/>
- I gotta go. We'll come to you.
- No, don't.
<br/>
Eddie. Eddie!
<br/>
- Thanks.
- Good luck.
<br/>
(siren)
<br/>
Officer. Hey, hey! Andy!
<br/>
You know that guy on the news?
I saw him run up there.
<br/>
RealIy, Maggie?
<br/>
You should have brought him in
when you had the chance.
<br/>
Get a unit to the observatory, right away!
<br/>
- Lily! Lily!
- Eddie, it's unbelievable.
<br/>
- We've gotta go!
- Listen.
<br/>
This counciI Iobbies for defence contractors...
The list goes on and on.
<br/>
We've gotta go now.
The cops are here. Come on!
<br/>
How did they find us?
<br/>
Hey! Hold it right there.
<br/>
Hey!
<br/>
Hold it! Hey!
<br/>
Stop!
<br/>
Hold it!
<br/>
Stop! HoId it right there.
<br/>
Get your hands up.
<br/>
Get 'em up!
<br/>
Walk back slowly towards me.
Come on, do it!
<br/>
Keep coming.
<br/>
Good, hold it right there.
<br/>
(helicopter)
<br/>
This is Nemitz, on the roof of the observatory.
I've got 'em.
<br/>
Aagh!
<br/>
(sirens)
<br/>
Go! Go, go, go, go!
<br/>
Come on!
<br/>
On the roof!
Get a medical team up here right away.
<br/>
Suspect is armed!
<br/>
Get in the boat!
<br/>
- Eddie, what are you doing?
- Get in!
<br/>
Eddie, what are you doing?
<br/>
The best I can.
<br/>
Get the boat!
He's on the ice!
<br/>
- Are you OK?
- Yes!
<br/>
He's out of our sight. 12 o'clock.
<br/>
LiIy, the bag! Give me the bag.
<br/>
Go, go!
<br/>
There's nobody in there!
<br/>
(TV) We need a pollution revolution.
<br/>
I don't care.
Search aIl of Wisconsin if you have to.
<br/>
They Iost him?
<br/>
We've been to C-Systems.
We can't get any information.
<br/>
It used to be a government-run facility.
Now county records say it doesn't even exist.
<br/>
Maybe you weren't realIy there.
<br/>
Maybe we're not realIy here.
<br/>
(Lily gasps)
<br/>
Eddie, I can't... feel my Iegs.
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
We've got fire, we've got fire.
<br/>
Why would a policeman
shoot another policeman?
<br/>
Maybe they weren't police.
<br/>
Why didn't they shoot at us?
<br/>
I don't know.
<br/>
What a dump, huh?
<br/>
- But I can't do...
- Mr Shannon.
<br/>
There's two gentlemen
from the FBI here to see you.
<br/>
This is more important
than his afternoon tea.
<br/>
Our apoIogies for interrupting
your tea, Mr Shannon.
<br/>
- But what's Kasalivich doing in Wisconsin?
- Running away from you.
<br/>
We understand he phoned you.
<br/>
I counselled Eddie
to turn himself in to the authorities.
<br/>
He and Miss SincIair
shot a Wisconsin state trooper.
<br/>
- I doubt that very seriously.
- Well, the state trooper's very dead.
<br/>
Mr Shannon, these are copies
of the Moore Foundation IRS fiIes.
<br/>
Do you know what's in them?
<br/>
Meagre tax records, I imagine.
We are a non-profit organisation.
<br/>
The funding for your foundation
comes from a wide variety of sources.
<br/>
Defence contractors,
teIecommunication companies, aerospace.
<br/>
It's gratifying to know
our work is appreciated.
<br/>
The bulk of funding seems to come
from one Cayman Islands account.
<br/>
- I don't do the fundraising.
- Oh, yeah. And the account is classified.
<br/>
- Who pays your salary, Mr Shannon?
- The foundation pays my salary.
<br/>
CIassified accounts,
encrypted phone caIls...
<br/>
A man could be forgiven for thinking
that your foundation is a front for the CIA.
<br/>
In that case, there may be national security
issues here that are Iarger than alI of us.
<br/>
Obstructing an FBI investigation
is a federaI crime.
<br/>
- I know the law, Mr...
- Doyle.
<br/>
National security does not incIude
murdering peopIe. Domestically, at least.
<br/>
TelI your friends at LangIey
that domestic is our back yard.
<br/>
They're not aIlowed to play here.
<br/>
You can keep the returns.
<br/>
Nice house.
<br/>
And for dinner tonight,
we have a choice of sardines...
<br/>
or sardines.
<br/>
Gosh, I think I'll have... sardines.
<br/>
Sardines. BeautifuI choice.
<br/>
So, is this how you seduce aIl the girIs?
<br/>
Only physicists with hypothermia
who are accused of being a terrorist.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
There's a garage.
I'm going to see what's in there.
<br/>
I won't be long, OK?
<br/>
Your pit bull has killed
a Wisconsin state trooper.
<br/>
Well, now.
<br/>
Would you rather the Bureau
got the girl and Kasalivich?
<br/>
First, he was a suspect.
Worst-case scenario, they arrest him.
<br/>
Now he's a cop-killer.
Worst-case scenario, they kill him.
<br/>
For God's sake, what possessed you
to frame him in the first pIace?
<br/>
Two words.
<br/>
Convenience and expedience.
<br/>
He saw too much, he was talking.
<br/>
The poor boy was
in the wrong pIace at the wrong time.
<br/>
I need this poor boy!
<br/>
This poor boy is the onIy one
who knows the frequencies!
<br/>
Do you understand the concept, Lyman?
<br/>
Poor impulse control?
<br/>
BarkIey, Chen, the regulator.
That was supposed to be it!
<br/>
That was alI of it!
<br/>
I am sick to death
of cIeaning up your messes.
<br/>
No, Paul, no. Yours. Not mine.
<br/>
You lost it, Paul.
<br/>
Lost control, perspective.
<br/>
You made it personal with these peopIe.
<br/>
Well, we'll find them, and when we do
and we've got this thing working,
<br/>
then, my friend, then,
<br/>
this young man will be a liability.
<br/>
That'Il be my problem.
<br/>
- Our problem.
- No, Lyman.
<br/>
When the time comes,
<br/>
I'll handle it.
<br/>
You'd better.
<br/>
(footsteps)
<br/>
- So what does he want us to do?
- We find him and give him an injection.
<br/>
(cocks pistol)
<br/>
(creaking)
<br/>
LiIy.
<br/>
LiIy!
<br/>
(drops tray)
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
Leesburg, Virginia.
C-Systems.
<br/>
- Who are they?
- Not cops.
<br/>
Cops carry badges,
<br/>
credit cards,
pictures of their families.
<br/>
(Eddie) If it's crowded, don't go in.
<br/>
OK.
<br/>
Hi. Can I heIp you?
<br/>
I'd like to send some fIowers
and a note to a friend in Virginia.
<br/>
It's a little strange, Mr Shannon,
but these just arrived.
<br/>
I'm not quite sure where they're from.
Here's a note.
<br/>
May I see that?
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Hold it right there, buddy. FBI.
<br/>
Step outside the van, please.
<br/>
Why don't you bring
your invoice sheet out with you?
<br/>
Do you know if the order
originated at this shop?
<br/>
I don't think so.
I think it was a wire from Georgetown.
<br/>
- Mind if I take one of these?
- No, sure.
<br/>
Have a nice day.
<br/>
So, officialIy this investigation
is now code-named Steel Bomb.
<br/>
We'll input the data into Rapid Start.
<br/>
Look what I brought back
from the flower shop.
<br/>
I think this is Kasalivich.
<br/>
Spawn versus Neanderthal man, 4pm today.
<br/>
- What is this, a wrestling match?
- Bad movie, video game?
<br/>
Spawn, it's a comic-book character.
<br/>
- The guy who comes back from the dead?
- Yeah, like Kasalivich.
<br/>
Maybe Shannon is the Neanderthal man?
<br/>
Very well may be.
<br/>
HeIlo, Eddie.
<br/>
- Glad you got the flowers.
- Very clever.
<br/>
- Are you all right?
- No, not really.
<br/>
I guess I can understand that.
<br/>
We were at Maggie's. Caught.
We were about to be arrested.
<br/>
Somebody shot the cop.
Later, two guys tried to kilI us.
<br/>
I've got my car outside. FoIlow me.
We'll go somepIace we can taIk.
<br/>
I found this... in one of the guy's wallets.
<br/>
They weren't cops.
<br/>
What do you know about C-Systems, Paul?
<br/>
This is not the time or the place, Eddie.
We're being watched.
<br/>
Eddie, the world isn't as simpIe
as we'd like it to be.
<br/>
It just doesn't work that way.
<br/>
- Shannon, who are you?
- I'm your friend, Eddie.
<br/>
- I may be your onIy friend.
- Is it you, Paul?
<br/>
Are you responsible for all this?
<br/>
Time to go, Eddie.
You've got a job to compIete.
<br/>
The experiment needs verifying.
<br/>
Do your work... This will all be over.
<br/>
Eddie, we're beyond that now.
Let's just get this done.
<br/>
Come back to work with me.
<br/>
You'll have your life back, I promise you.
<br/>
You don't control our lives.
<br/>
- You'll have to trust me, Eddie.
- Just like Alistair?
<br/>
Eddie!
<br/>
(loudspeaker) A trip that
normally takes over five hours.
<br/>
But today, you'll experience the events
of that flight in just seven minutes,
<br/>
from takeoff to landing.
<br/>
The crew is preparing for takeoff.
<br/>
Your pilot for today's flight
is Captain Dave Larsen.
<br/>
Stay here.
<br/>
Our co-pilot is First Officer...
<br/>
Get in.
<br/>
She's in the hatch.
<br/>
Look out!
<br/>
The crew are going through
their final pre-flight checks...
<br/>
Eddie!
<br/>
Eddie!
Come on, don't do anything fooIish.
<br/>
Get Ford. DC police reported
a disturbance at the Science Museum,
<br/>
by the NeanderthaI man exhibit.
<br/>
(Eddie) CQ 493... CQ 493.
<br/>
(siren)
<br/>
Here you are, darling. Drink this.
<br/>
You're dehydrated.
Wash it out of your system.
<br/>
Mr Collier and I have a few colleagues
we'd Iike you to meet.
<br/>
Dr HolIoway, Dr Hamada, and Dr Orbit.
<br/>
They are very interested
to discuss your work with you.
<br/>
And, of course, Dr Lu Chen.
<br/>
(Lily) Lu.
<br/>
(Shannon) Lily.
<br/>
We would like you and Dr Chen to continue
the work you were doing with Dr BarkIey.
<br/>
- You can't be serious!
- Oh, yes.
<br/>
We've been impressed with your work
for a Iong time.
<br/>
Do you drug and kidnap everyone
whose work you admire?
<br/>
No.
<br/>
Dr Barkley, we left behind.
<br/>
Slay the dreamer, eh, Mr Shannon?
<br/>
(man) You end up sIeeping on the street.
I can't believe you'd do that.
<br/>
Don't even say that kind of stuff.
<br/>
Can you spare some change?
A quarter, what's a quarter?
<br/>
Can't you see me?
<br/>
Can I share your grate?
<br/>
(woman) You make me sick!
<br/>
(siren)
<br/>
(woman) We can't go in! We got kicked out!
<br/>
(woman) What are all youse looking at?
<br/>
Let go!
<br/>
(taps keys)
<br/>
(Eddie) CQ 493.
<br/>
(TV) This is Eddie. I think. He does.
But he really does.
<br/>
What are you watching?
Honeymooner reruns?
<br/>
KasaIivich and Barkley. Look at this.
<br/>
Does he look like he's about to kill this guy
and blow the pIace up?
<br/>
The whoIe thing stinks.
Thanks.
<br/>
We've got the ballistics report back
on that trooper killed in Wisconsin.
<br/>
TefIon sniper round
went through the cop's Kevlar vest.
<br/>
I don't buy it.
He's smart enough to blow up the lab,
<br/>
but stupid enough to leave $250,000
where we'd be sure to find it?
<br/>
Are you saying some cowboy's
gone off the reservation?
<br/>
$100. The kid didn't do it.
<br/>
You've got a nationwide manhunt
for an innocent man.
<br/>
Make sure nobody shoots him.
<br/>
(phone rings)
<br/>
Next shift's going down now, OK?
<br/>
Yeah, right.
HeIp me out on this, will ya?
<br/>
I've got problems with the conveyor belt.
<br/>
No, I'll have Jim Zinsky work on that.
<br/>
(workman) OK? All right.
<br/>
If you've got any probIems,
give me a caIl on channeI four.
<br/>
How is our young charge?
Did she say anything?
<br/>
We'll soon find out, won't we?
The young lady appears to be cooperating.
<br/>
Good.
<br/>
- Gentlemen, you're just in time.
- Let's get on with it.
<br/>
Miss Sinclair, Mr Chen,
please, have a seat.
<br/>
(loudspeaker) Attention, all personnel.
<br/>
Critical path experiment
will commence in ten minutes.
<br/>
Level five.
<br/>
(voices)
<br/>
Activate the H2 compressor.
<br/>
On automatic.
<br/>
Here we go.
<br/>
- Lucasz, what are you reading?
- Two miIlion keIvin.
<br/>
Activate the laser.
<br/>
(Lucasz) Four million kelvin.
<br/>
(bleeping)
<br/>
You don't have it. It's unstable.
<br/>
Shut it down! Shut it down!
<br/>
Dammit! What a joke.
<br/>
- It won't work without the right frequencies.
- (speaks Chinese)
<br/>
What did he say?
<br/>
He said that's what
he's been trying to teIl you for days.
<br/>
Look. Let's try it again in the morning, OK?
<br/>
- See you back here at 8:15 tomorrow?
- I have a feeling, Dr Sinclair,
<br/>
- the solution will present itself.
- I doubt it.
<br/>
It had better,
or your usefulness will soon be outlived.
<br/>
Take them back to their room.
<br/>
I wish you wouldn't threaten
to kilI my scientists to their faces.
<br/>
It might make my job easier.
<br/>
Lucasz, Hamada, seal the lab!
<br/>
I want to see those printouts
first thing in the morning.
<br/>
(clunking)
<br/>
- It's working?
- Yes.
<br/>
- How?
- Lucasz claims he figured it out.
<br/>
- Lucasz?
- That's his story.
<br/>
You should have seen it when I got here -
the output was going right through the roof!
<br/>
Son of a bitch.
<br/>
It reaIly does work. Ha!
<br/>
Dr Shannon, take a look at that.
<br/>
We've got it.
<br/>
What did you do?
<br/>
Nothing.
<br/>
I couldn't sleep last night, sir.
<br/>
I heard this voice saying,
"Go down and check different frequencies",
<br/>
because we were trying
on 15 and 20 megahertz.
<br/>
So I went down to the Iab
and ran the experiment and it all worked out.
<br/>
So, here we are, sir.
<br/>
- Did you document the frequencies?
- Not yet.
<br/>
I'd like those on a disk. Now, sir.
<br/>
None too shabby, hey, Mr Shannon?
<br/>
- Doctor.
- Thank you.
<br/>
- Where are you going, Paul?
- To check this against the Chicago data.
<br/>
I'll try to meet you at the silo.
<br/>
- Wait as long as you can.
- Yes, sir.
<br/>
HeIlo, Eddie.
I figured it was you.
<br/>
Nice pIace you have here, Shannon.
<br/>
Ten-megajoule lasers.
ParticIe reactors.
<br/>
Congress de-funded
most of the stuff down here years ago.
<br/>
- They made a mistake.
- Is this part of the Moore Foundation?
<br/>
In a manner of speaking.
<br/>
Power and money.
Is that what this was aIl about?
<br/>
I'm afraid it's more complicated than that.
<br/>
He was a 60-year-oId scientist
who did nothing but good,
<br/>
and they put a bag over his head.
<br/>
It was a mistake.
<br/>
Last thing I wanted
was for something to happen to Alistair.
<br/>
But a decision had to be made. So...
<br/>
Who made the decision?
<br/>
- You?
- That's my job.
<br/>
That's what I'm paid to do.
I'm paid to do dirty work.
<br/>
The work peopIe don't want to know about.
<br/>
PeopIe want to live in split-level homes,
<br/>
and eat microwave dinners
and watch coIour TV.
<br/>
Is that what you think?
<br/>
Alistair was a dreamer.
<br/>
CIean air, free energy.
<br/>
Noble concepts, but we live on a planet
that is addicted to petroleum.
<br/>
Now, what happens if you dump
free energy onto the worId market?
<br/>
Stock markets would plummet.
Our own economy would collapse overnight.
<br/>
Recession, unemployment, war.
<br/>
The worId is speeding up too fast now, Eddie.
<br/>
- We can barely hold on as it is.
- You're right, it's not working.
<br/>
That's why
we've got to try something else.
<br/>
Not bury the technology, but let it out.
<br/>
You let it out, but you let it out
at a pace the world can absorb.
<br/>
It can absorb it now.
<br/>
- There's our boy.
- Mr Kasalivich!
<br/>
How kind of you to join us.
<br/>
Give us a moment, Lyman.
<br/>
- Eddie and I are having a conversation.
- Please! Don't let me stop you!
<br/>
Who runs this place, Shannon?
You or the guy with the guns?
<br/>
Well, we are a cooperative of sorts.
<br/>
Run at the behest
of the United States government.
<br/>
- But without their knowledge, right?
- My, my, but your friend is sharp, Paul.
<br/>
All right, Eddie.
<br/>
What do you want?
<br/>
There are the specs for the regulator.
<br/>
You can pull the frequencies
off the computer. Now let us go.
<br/>
I get it to work. You give us our lives back.
<br/>
That was the deal, wasn't it?
<br/>
Yeah. Yeah, that was the deal.
<br/>
I'm afraid, young man,
your position is non-negotiabIe.
<br/>
I see.
<br/>
I want to tell you this story how I got inspired.
I had this dream...
<br/>
Hold on.
I will continue.
<br/>
(feedback)
<br/>
What's happening?
<br/>
- What did you just do?
- I just told the FBI I was willing to surrender.
<br/>
Oh, and I think your experiment
just got a mind of its own.
<br/>
Check the breakers.
Everybody, back to your stations!
<br/>
- What the hell's going on?
- It just started, hundreds of pages.
<br/>
Technical drawings,
specs for experiments, budgets,
<br/>
personneI records, minutes,
mostIy marked top secret.
<br/>
- Where's it coming from?
- C-Systems.
<br/>
It's like they dumped their mainframe
into our computers.
<br/>
- Here's a special love note just for you.
- Jesus Christ, Kasalivich.
<br/>
He says he's in a bunker in Leesburg
and wants us to come and arrest him.
<br/>
- Lake Geneva Radical Bomb Network?
- Sound like bullshit?
<br/>
It sounds Iike you owe me $100.
Make sure that fax doesn't run out of paper.
<br/>
- Hamada!
- Still off-line!
<br/>
- Pressure?
- 500 psi and rising.
<br/>
What the hell's going on?
<br/>
We've lost control of the system, Lyman.
We can't shut it down.
<br/>
- Turn it off.
- It's self-sustaining. It can't be shut down.
<br/>
Al, how long before
we run out of storage capacity?
<br/>
- I don't know.
- Eddie, 20 minutes before it blows?
<br/>
- Maybe less.
- Is he right?
<br/>
I'm afraid he is.
<br/>
Well done, Eddie.
Well done.
<br/>
You wouldn't blow it up
if you weren't sure you'd get out alive.
<br/>
Sure I wouId.
<br/>
Lyman, I think it's time
we got the heIl out of here.
<br/>
- (Eddie) No!
- Chen!
<br/>
- Lily!
- Chen!
<br/>
For God's sake, Lyman!
<br/>
Chen! Chen!
<br/>
Wait!
<br/>
- Jesus Christ!
- What is wrong with you?
<br/>
- Turn it off!
- That was totally unnecessary.
<br/>
If you haven't got the stomach for this,
stay out of the way.
<br/>
I'm going to turn down the power.
<br/>
- No!
- Don't touch that!
<br/>
Don't!
<br/>
(booming)
<br/>
(loudspeaker)
Hydrogen containment failure.
<br/>
Potential personnel hazard.
<br/>
- The compressor's just shut down.
- Turn it back on!
<br/>
- You can't.
- The computers are down.
<br/>
Get out!
Get out! Everybody!
<br/>
- Fix it.
- I can't now.
<br/>
- Fix it!
- I can't!
<br/>
- I wouldn't do that, Lyman.
- It will ignite the hydrogen.
<br/>
It's over, Lyman. It's over.
<br/>
- I guess it's time to go.
- Go! Go!
<br/>
Give me the disk.
<br/>
- You two, stay!
- No, Lyman! Let them go!
<br/>
What possible difference can it make now?
<br/>
- They stay!
- When does it end, Lyman?
<br/>
- Never.
- Well, it's not your decision.
<br/>
The decision is mine,
and I say they're coming.
<br/>
You can stay with them, if you like.
<br/>
We must go now!
<br/>
Well, are you coming?
<br/>
(loudspeaker) Warning. Warning.
Air contaminants at critical level.
<br/>
(Lyman) Come on, PauI!
We've got things to do!
<br/>
I'm sorry, Eddie.
<br/>
- Shannon!
- Shannon!
<br/>
Please!
<br/>
Warning! Air contaminants at critical level.
Evacuate immediately.
<br/>
All containment doors are now closed.
<br/>
The tanks.
<br/>
OK, here's the elevator.
<br/>
There's room for everybody.
<br/>
I'm looking for two men. Paul Shannon
and Lyman Collier. Hang onto them.
<br/>
Follow the blue evacuation route arrows
to the elevators.
<br/>
Move in an orderly fashion
quickly and quietly...
<br/>
GentIemen, our friends from the FBI
wilI be here presently.
<br/>
Anita, we're on our way.
<br/>
You two go to the north elevator.
I'll take it from here.
<br/>
Come on! Come on, Lily.
<br/>
Eddie, which way?
<br/>
By the way, PauI, do you have that disk?
The one with the magic frequency?
<br/>
Thank you so much.
<br/>
You know, Paul,
maybe it's time to caIl it a day.
<br/>
Maybe we're getting too old for this.
What do you think, huh?
<br/>
But then again,
what would we do?
<br/>
What would we do?
<br/>
(alarm)
<br/>
(gunshots)
<br/>
I didn't tell you, Lyman, but your retirement
had already been arranged.
<br/>
Containment systems off.
<br/>
Access restored to all areas.
Containment systems off.
<br/>
Hey, hold on, hoId on!
Take it up, take it up!
<br/>
- They got a 20 on Kasalivich?
- They found the stolen truck
<br/>
at the construction site one mile to the west.
<br/>
(Eddie) Hold on.
<br/>
Eddie, look.
<br/>
(screaming)
<br/>
Get up, Reed. Come on, we've gotta go!
<br/>

<br/>
Get back in the seat, Ernie.
<br/>
Eddie.
<br/>
(buzzer)
<br/>
LiIy, get in the basket!
<br/>
Get out of here. Go!
<br/>

Come on, Eddie.
<br/>
Aagh!
<br/>
Come on, Eddie. Come on!
<br/>
PuIl it up, puIl it up.
<br/>
Holy... did you see that?
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
Come on, get 'em out of there.
<br/>
(cheering)
<br/>
- Eddie Kasalivich.
- Agent Ford. You got the message.
<br/>
Yeah, we levelled a forest printing it.
What's it mean, Eddie?
<br/>
- Plans for clean, cheap energy.
- Anybody else get this?
<br/>
Hopefully, a few thousand top scientists.
<br/>
- I knew I liked this kid.
- Yeah, right, Leon.
<br/>
Come on. You've got some questions to
answer in Washington for about six weeks.
<br/>
- That's OK.
- We've got a lot to talk about,
<br/>
as Iong as everyone stops shooting at us.
<br/>
Doyle, spilt 'em up.
I'll meet you at the office.
<br/>
Ford!
<br/>
Doctor Sinclair and I ride together.
<br/>
All right, come on, both of you.
<br/>
Anita, take a memo.
<br/>
To the Director of CentraI InteIligence.
<br/>
C-Systems...
<br/>
no longer a viable entity.
<br/>
Will be in contact.
<br/>
That's it.
<br/>
Whoa!
