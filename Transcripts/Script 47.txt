way too many times.<br/>
Mm. Excuse me.<br/>

I don't wantyou moving<br/>
halfway around the world.<br/>
Claire, you're such a ruiner!<br/>
( scoffs )<br/>
I'd gone, like, a halfhour<br/>
without thinking about it.<br/>
Hailey, I'm sorry, but...<br/>
Besides,<br/>
I haven't kissed Raymond yet.<br/>

We just... we have to decode<br/>

I mean, if<br/>
he's into her,<br/>
he'll shake his hair,<br/>
stretch his arms<br/>
- and flex those muscles.<br/>
- Yeah?<br/>
( chuckles )<br/>
Wha-What was that?<br/>
Fingers. That was fingers<br/>
through the hair.<br/>
I mean, technically,<br/>
that wasn't shaking.<br/>
Right?<br/>

You met Claire.<br/>
Australia could be another<br/>
amazing adventure for us, Hails.<br/>
So... how about<br/>
we start packing your room?<br/>
So how about I live here<br/>
with Claire till I'm 1 8?<br/>
How about... we go back<br/>

And I have coed PE class<br/>

We have to dance with Raymond<br/>
at The Last Splash.<br/>
We'll be such<br/>
great dancers<br/>
that he'll realize<br/>

And we'll be so happy<br/>

must've been flexed.<br/>
Ifyou had<br/>
stopped breathing!<br/>
You were, like, this close<br/>
to mouth-to-mouth.<br/>
There's something<br/>
in there.<br/>
I'm serious!<br/>
It looked like...<br/>
I can't even say it,<br/>
but I swear, it just stared<br/>
at me with its eyes!<br/>
You're in shock...<br/>
from touching Raymond!<br/>
Hailey, I know what I saw.<br/>
Fine, then we'll<br/>
just go back<br/>
when no one is looking,<br/>
and we'll check it out.<br/>
No way, Hail.<br/>
I didn't mean to get<br/>
in the water in the first place,<br/>
and I'm not going<br/>
back there again.<br/>

I want to feed it.<br/>
Fish sticks?<br/>
Maybe it was an octopus.<br/>

With blue hair<br/>
- and a tail?<br/>

or kelp.<br/>
It was not an octopus,<br/>
and it wasn't kelp!<br/>

God!<br/>
Listen,<br/>

Mer... maid.<br/>
Mermaid.<br/>

Fabled marine creature,<br/>
halfwoman, halffish,<br/>
best known for sitting on<br/>

and obsessively combing<br/>
our long, beautiful hair.<br/>
Blah, blah, blah...<br/>

- ( screaming )<br/>
- Stop shrieking<br/>
Iike a couple of gulls.<br/>
For shrimps,<br/>
you're awfully loud.<br/>

You speak English?<br/>
Yeah. Mermaids speak every<br/>
language known to man,<br/>
fish, crustacean...<br/>
and several varieties<br/>
of sea fowl.<br/>
What can you speak?<br/>
I got a C in Spanish.<br/>
Hmm.<br/>
( gasps ):<br/>
Wait.<br/>
What if she's, like,<br/>
bad or something?<br/>
( whispering ):<br/>
Whywould she be bad?<br/>
She's a fictional sea creature.<br/>
They could be bad.<br/>
We are not fictional!<br/>
We're discreet. Hm.<br/>
I've never been this<br/>
close to a human before.<br/>
( nervous chuckle ):<br/>
Yeah. Must be weird foryou.<br/>

( lowrumbling )<br/>
Mm!<br/>
How-how did you do that?<br/>
oh, that's nothing.<br/>
You should see my father.<br/>
He can make some serious waves.<br/>
Like last night,<br/>
for example.<br/>
Your dad made those waves?<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
He's mad at me,<br/>
because I swam away from home<br/>

I'm supposed to get<br/>

You really need to stop.<br/>

You worry too much.<br/>
I rest my case.<br/>
( scoffs )<br/>
This is so much fun.<br/>
( whoops )<br/>
oh! I love legs.<br/>
CLAI RE:<br/>
So...<br/>
do you get to keep them?<br/>
Technically, we can only have<br/>
legs when the sun's out.<br/>
And we have to keep them dry,<br/>
or at least that's<br/>
what I've heard.<br/>
I've never had the guts<br/>
to come out and try them.<br/>
So this is your<br/>
first time ashore?<br/>
First time on land,<br/>
first time with legs.<br/>
Can you believe it?<br/>
oh, you'd never know.<br/>
But I've got<br/>
to be careful.<br/>
Add moonlight or<br/>
water, instant tail.<br/>

( Aquamarine groans )<br/>
I have to find love.<br/>
We don't have it where I'm from,<br/>
and if I can't find it<br/>
in three days, I'm sunk.<br/>
You don't have love?<br/>
No.<br/>
My dad says it's just a myth.<br/>
We marrywho our parents pick.<br/>
And my dad thinks<br/>
that I have bubbles in my brain<br/>
because I believe in love.<br/>
He says that the onlyway<br/>
I can get out of mywedding<br/>
is ifl can prove to him<br/>
that love exists.<br/>
But that means<br/>
I only get three days.<br/>
or else I'll be swimming<br/>
down the aisle with that...<br/>
( shudders )... that blowfish.<br/>
But ifyou<br/>
don't have love,<br/>
how doyou know it exists?<br/>

He said I was hot,<br/>
but how would he know?<br/>
Do I feel hot to you?<br/>

You have to help me get him<br/>
to fall in love with me.<br/>
Yeah, right!<br/>
No, no, no.<br/>
No, Raymond's way too popular.<br/>
You should pick someone else.<br/>
I mean, all the girls<br/>

Fine.<br/>
Then you don't getyourwish.<br/>

You know, ifyou help a<br/>
mermaid, you get a wish.<br/>
Anywish<br/>

I thought that was genies.<br/>
( laughs )<br/>
You... you believe in genies?<br/>
Uh... what if ourwish<br/>
involves other people?<br/>
- Like my mom.<br/>

( Haileylaughs )<br/>
That's what you do.<br/>
Ugh!<br/>
You're so primitive.<br/>
I wear stick-ons.<br/>
You mean, clip-ons?<br/>
No.<br/>
You'll love these.<br/>
They're my favorite<br/>
aquatic accessory.<br/>
You see that buoy<br/>
out there?<br/>
I need you to swim out there<br/>
and find me a couple<br/>
of starfish about...<br/>
mmm, this big.<br/>
Live starfish?<br/>
That's whatyou wear<br/>
for earrings?<br/>
They compliment me.<br/>
Seriously, Aqua,<br/>
I've got some earrings<br/>
that'll complement<br/>
you just fine.<br/>
No. I mean, they literally<br/>
give me compliments.<br/>
- In my ear. They talk to me.<br/>
- Huh? Huh?<br/>
Starfish are notorious suck-ups.<br/>
They love<br/>
to give compliments.<br/>
But it's nice<br/>
when you need a little boost.<br/>
- ( buoybell clangs )<br/>
- okay, guys,<br/>
Iet's go.<br/>
Hailey, I can't.<br/>
You've got to do this.<br/>
Do you see how far<br/>
that buoy is? No.<br/>
Don't worry about it.<br/>
I'll get you a ride.<br/>
( whistles )<br/>
- ( bell clanging )<br/>
- ( continues whistling )<br/>
( muffled whistling )<br/>
No way!<br/>
( Hailey laughs )<br/>
Wow...<br/>
oh!<br/>
- Hi!<br/>
- ( dolphins chattering )<br/>
Hi, guys!<br/>
oh!<br/>
Watch the legs, guys!<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
- Claire, look at that!<br/>
- Hi!<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
- oh, my goodness.<br/>
Claire, you have to do this<br/>
with me.<br/>
( squeaky chattering )<br/>
You go.<br/>
Have fun.<br/>
okay. All right.<br/>
( squeaky chattering )<br/>
Are you sure?<br/>
Yeah. ( laughs )<br/>
( laughs )<br/>
( shudders ):<br/>
Ah...<br/>
( laughs )<br/>
( Hailey gasps, yells )<br/>
Claire! Look at me!<br/>
CLAI RE:<br/>
Whoo-hoo! Way to go, Hail!<br/>
( laughing, gasping )<br/>
Hailey!<br/>
Hi, guys!<br/>
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!<br/>
( exhales ):<br/>
Don't you just...<br/>
Iove love?<br/>
What?<br/>
It's just...<br/>
you're so sure<br/>
ofyourself.<br/>
Well, I've only seen love<br/>
up close once,<br/>
but ifyou'd seen it<br/>
the way I did,<br/>
you'd feel the same way.<br/>
Why? What was it like?<br/>
It was years ago.<br/>
Not too far from here,<br/>
actually.<br/>
We were migrating<br/>
through the bay,<br/>
just like we always do<br/>
this time ofyear, and...<br/>
I saw this couple out sailing<br/>
on their little blue boat,<br/>
and thewaythey looked<br/>
at each other,<br/>
it was a look I'd never seen<br/>
anywhere else in the seven seas.<br/>
I've wanted someone to look<br/>
at me that way ever since.<br/>
I looked for them everyyear,<br/>
but I never saw them again.<br/>
Was there a name...<br/>
on the boat?<br/>
Mm, I don't remember, Claire.<br/>
oh, the Claire de Lune.<br/>
That's my parents.<br/>
Claire, they really loved<br/>
each other.<br/>
I don't think<br/>
theywould've wanted you<br/>
to be afraid oflife.<br/>
I think theywould've wanted<br/>
you to be friends with it.<br/>
( voice breaking ):<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
( Haileyshouting )<br/>
Whoo! Hailey!<br/>
( sighs )<br/>
It was the most<br/>
incredible thing ever.<br/>
It was something I wish<br/>
I could've done with you.<br/>
STARFISH:<br/>
Aqua! Aqua!<br/>
- Thereyou go.<br/>
- STARFISH: oh, Aqua!<br/>
SERVER:<br/>
And foryou.<br/>
HAI LEY:<br/>
Thankyou.<br/>
STARFISH:<br/>
Aquamarine is so lovely.<br/>
oh, stop...<br/>
She makes us so lovely<br/>
just being near<br/>
such loveliness.<br/>
- ( gentle suctioning )<br/>
- And she's smart.<br/>
Smart, yes, like tuna!<br/>
HAI LEY:<br/>
Like tuna.<br/>
We love<br/>
being near Aqua.<br/>
Aqua, Aqua, Aqua!<br/>
( giggling )<br/>
Lookwho it is.<br/>
Wow, the blue hair's<br/>
spreading.<br/>
You guys look like<br/>
the grandma brigade.<br/>
What's next,<br/>
dentures or Depends?<br/>
What's next is I'm going<br/>
with Raymond to the Last Splash.<br/>
I've got some advice.<br/>
You need to separate<br/>
fantasy from reality.<br/>
Ray's going to the Last<br/>
Splash with Cecilia.<br/>
She asked him last night<br/>
at the street fair.<br/>
What?!.<br/>
I'd love to stay and chat,<br/>
but we're late<br/>
for Cecilia's pre-party.<br/>
I've got some advice<br/>
foryou two.<br/>
( shrieking )<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
( gasping )<br/>
Put on a dry shirt.<br/>
- That was totally amazing!<br/>
- That was crazy!<br/>
It's Ray.<br/>
I can't believe<br/>
I was so stupid!<br/>
Whywould he choose<br/>
her over me?<br/>
You're supposed to know him.<br/>
He obviously doesn't<br/>
like me at all!<br/>
That's not possible.<br/>
I never should've trusted you<br/>
in the first place.<br/>
Aqua, he's intoyou!<br/>
This doesn't<br/>
make sense!<br/>
Bull shark!<br/>
Forget it. I'm going home.<br/>
Aqua, no! Wait!<br/>
HAI LEY:<br/>
Claire...<br/>
this is totally,<br/>
completely...<br/>
eternally over.<br/>
I'm moving.<br/>
( sighs )<br/>
I'm going to be<br/>
the new girl again.<br/>
You know what? No.<br/>
No, we're going to split up.<br/>
You're going to go<br/>
stop Aqua, and...<br/>
and I'm going to go<br/>
find Raymond, okay?<br/>
Meet me back at the club<br/>
as soon as possible.<br/>
Hurry!<br/>
Go!<br/>
( waves gurgling )<br/>
HAI LEY:<br/>
Aqua, don't do it!<br/>
Don't do it!<br/>
Aqua, you can't do this!<br/>
Why not? I'm never going<br/>
to see him again.<br/>
And you know what?<br/>
He doesn't care.<br/>
I'm just going<br/>
to go home.<br/>
This was all<br/>
for nothing.<br/>
It was not for nothing;<br/>
it was for love.<br/>
You know what I<br/>
think oflove?<br/>
Love stinks.<br/>
No wonderwe don't<br/>
have it back home.<br/>
Please don't give upyet.<br/>
Why, because<br/>
ofyourwish?<br/>
Let me tell you something.<br/>
My dad said he loved me.<br/>
He said he loved my mother,<br/>
and then he left us.<br/>
He left us<br/>
for some otherwoman...<br/>
but I guess<br/>
that's just the way it is<br/>
and love doesn't always work.<br/>
I don't understand.<br/>
That's life.<br/>
That's how it is here.<br/>
But when you find love,<br/>
I guess it's<br/>
really beautiful,<br/>
or at least that's what<br/>
I've read in magazines.<br/>
And I don't know<br/>
as much about it as I say I do,<br/>
but I know that there's a reason<br/>
why everybodywants it so much.<br/>
And what's that?<br/>
It's the closest thing<br/>
we have to magic.<br/>
Don't give upyet.<br/>
oh, my God!<br/>
What's happening to me?<br/>
I'm leaking!<br/>
( laughing ):<br/>
Aqua, you're crying.<br/>
I'm leaking saltwater.<br/>
I'm falling apart.<br/>
No, they're tears.<br/>
Your body makes them<br/>
when you cry.<br/>
I guess you wouldn't<br/>
have them, living underwater.<br/>
This is crazy.<br/>
Nextyou're<br/>
going to tell me<br/>
water shoots out ofyour<br/>
nose when you're happy.<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
only occasionally.<br/>
( chatting indistinctly )<br/>
( bike bell rings )<br/>
Nice bike.<br/>
( girls snickering )<br/>
Still has tassels.<br/>
Time for a swim!<br/>
( squealing )<br/>
Excuse me.<br/>
How could you do this to Aqua?<br/>
Uh, do what?<br/>
Take Cecilia<br/>
to the Last Splash<br/>
afteryou already asked<br/>
Aquamarine.<br/>
Yeah, well,<br/>
that was before I found out<br/>
that she has a boyfriend.<br/>
A boyfriend?<br/>
Yeah. The one<br/>
she practicallyjumped<br/>
overboard for<br/>
to watch the sunset?<br/>
Aqua doesn't have a boyfriend.<br/>
Who told you that?<br/>
Vince!<br/>
- Vince!<br/>
- Huh?<br/>
- The little girl wants to go in.<br/>
- I want to go in where?<br/>
( sing-songy):<br/>
Into the pool!<br/>
( screaming ):<br/>
No! Put me down!<br/>
No! No! No! No!<br/>
Hey, hey, hey, Vince,<br/>
don't, man, don't! Stop!<br/>
- ( screaming )<br/>
- Hey, put her down. Come on.<br/>
VI NCE:<br/>
okay, okay. Whoo!<br/>
Geez, relax.<br/>
What's the big drama?<br/>
VI NCE:<br/>
Pfft! Whatever.<br/>
( sniffles )<br/>
( sobbing )<br/>
God, take a joke.<br/>
"Take a joke"?<br/>
Wha-What's the matter with you?<br/>
She's scared.<br/>
She was trying<br/>
to get attention. Hello!<br/>
No, that's yourjob,<br/>
isn't it, Cecilia?<br/>
Raymond, I was kidding.<br/>
Joke? Hello!<br/>
( sniffling )<br/>
Claire, Claire, hold on.<br/>
Hey, you okay?<br/>
Look, um, doyou know<br/>
where I can find Aqua?<br/>
I really need<br/>
to talk to her.<br/>
Yeah? Is that a nod?<br/>
I know I see a nod.<br/>
D.J. ( overradio ):<br/>
This next one's<br/>
for the brokenhearted out there.<br/>
( woman singing ballad)<br/>
( Aquamarine moaning )<br/>
Who needs Raymond?<br/>
I found two new men<br/>
to love.<br/>
Their names are Ben and Jerry.<br/>
( Haileylaughing )<br/>
Mm!<br/>
( sighs )<br/>
Raymond.<br/>
Who needs Raymond?<br/>
I need some salt.<br/>
You know, I-I don't know<br/>
what Cecilia was<br/>
talking about.<br/>
( sighs )<br/>
I, uh, think they're<br/>
in here in my room.<br/>
( gasps )<br/>
- ( splashing )<br/>
- Aqua's right around here...<br/>
oh, God!<br/>
Hey!<br/>
( clears throat )<br/>
Uh, um, sorry. I'm sorry.<br/>
How's it going?<br/>
Bad. No, good. Fine.<br/>
( clears throat )<br/>
Why don't you wait<br/>
on the balcony,<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- and we'll be out in a sec.<br/>
( mouthing )<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
What was he<br/>
doing here?!.<br/>
Cecilia told him<br/>
Aqua had a boyfriend.<br/>
( gasps, then scoffs )<br/>
That... that barnacle!<br/>
But Raymond wants<br/>
to talk to you.<br/>
- oh, my God! oh, my God!<br/>
- Yes! Yes!<br/>
AQUAMARI NE:<br/>
oh, my God!<br/>
( giggling )<br/>
- Hey.<br/>

( indistinct conversation )<br/>
- Hey, you know what?<br/>
- And then the fish attacked me.<br/>
- It attacked you? Really?<br/>
- Yeah.<br/>
- Kind of like a penguin, like...<br/>
- RAY: Later, guys.<br/>

Gently catch it.<br/>

I've been trying to land<br/>

It is.<br/>
It's unbelievable.<br/>
You've been there?<br/>
Well, I've been<br/>
to lots of places.<br/>
But I've learned it's not where<br/>
you are, it's whoyou're with.<br/>
Hmm.<br/>
You always<br/>

Yes.<br/>
More people should be like that.<br/>

Freak city.<br/>
This is so lame.<br/>

Aquamarine...<br/>
She's a mermaid.<br/>
She has, she has scales<br/>
and everything.<br/>
She has a big, fat tail.<br/>
That's why she lives<br/>
in thewatertower.<br/>
Whoa. You need<br/>
to slow way down.<br/>
What areyou<br/>
talking about?<br/>
You're sounding<br/>
a little crazy, Cecilia.<br/>
No, no, no, no.<br/>
No, I'm not crazy.<br/>
No, I saw it with my own eyes.<br/>
- You're freaking us out.<br/>
- There's no mermaid.<br/>
Why areyou looking<br/>
at me like that<br/>
when there's a mermaid<br/>
in a water tower, you guys?<br/>
There's no mermaid.<br/>
oh, okay. Fine.<br/>
And by the way, why'd you<br/>
guys leave me there, huh?<br/>
Do you have any idea<br/>
how far I had to walk?!.<br/>
- ( giggling )<br/>

GI RL ( laughing ):<br/>

Bye, Mom.<br/>
Hey, be back soon,<br/>
Hails.<br/>
Daddy! Daddy!<br/>
Daddy, it's so horrible.<br/>
I went on my run<br/>
this morning,<br/>
down by the water tower,<br/>
and, and I heard this<br/>
crying and...<br/>
this poor girl,<br/>
I think she's<br/>
trapped up there.<br/>
Did you call the police?<br/>
Uh, I wanted<br/>
to tell you first.<br/>
( phone keypadbeeping )<br/>
- ( knocking )<br/>
- Come in.<br/>
- ( knocking )<br/>
- Come in.<br/>
Hey.<br/>
Hey.<br/>
Will you take care<br/>
of Moby for me?<br/>
You won't have to go tomorrow.<br/>
Believe me.<br/>
So, I was thinking,<br/>
we should meet at the pier<br/>
at around 8:455.<br/>
Hail.<br/>
- Areyou listening to me?<br/>
- Mm-hmm.<br/>
Maybe we should think<br/>
about thewish.<br/>
What doyou mean?<br/>
We know what<br/>
we're doing<br/>
with ourwish.<br/>
You're staying in Baybridge.<br/>
Right, but I was thinking<br/>
about it all last night,<br/>
and...<br/>
um, my mom has worked<br/>
all her life forthis.<br/>
Maybe it's not fair.<br/>
We asked for a miracle, Hailey,<br/>
and we got it.<br/>
We're using it.<br/>
Maybe we could wish<br/>
for something else, maybe.<br/>
Something else?<br/>
Mm-hmm.<br/>
Like what?<br/>
Like a new best friend?<br/>
A new person<br/>
to tell everything to?<br/>
Claire, no, stop it.<br/>
How can you even think that way?<br/>
I'm just saying,<br/>
maybe we'll learn<br/>
to stand on our own<br/>
for a change, you know?<br/>
- You mean me, don'tyou?<br/>
- I mean I'm notyour mom.<br/>
Please.<br/>
You act like I need you<br/>
all the time when...<br/>
the truth is,<br/>
you're so mad at the world<br/>
that nobody but me even<br/>
wants to talk toyou.<br/>
oh?<br/>
Soyou're the one who's<br/>
lived hereyourwhole life?<br/>
How doyou figure<br/>
that I'm your only friend?<br/>
Huh?<br/>
( sniffling )<br/>
...WQDA, the coast's<br/>
breaking news channel.<br/>
A report just in<br/>
ofa young girl trapped<br/>
- in the Baybridge water tower.<br/>
- ( shrieks )<br/>
We're going live to Storm Banks,<br/>
our man on the scene.<br/>
This is Storm Banks reporting<br/>
live from Baybridge water tower,<br/>
where an unidentified girl<br/>
has been trapped.<br/>
Firefighters<br/>
are racing against time<br/>
- to rescue this girl...<br/>
- Hailey, wait!<br/>
...from a watery grave.<br/>
Hailey, wait!<br/>
Hailey!<br/>
( sighs )<br/>
So how did you<br/>
come across this?<br/>
CECI LIA:<br/>
I was just out<br/>
for my morning run,<br/>
and all of a sudden<br/>
I heard this horrible screaming.<br/>
I didn't know what to do,<br/>
and, I mean,<br/>
I did the first thing<br/>
that came to my mind,<br/>
which was go<br/>
to inform the newscast,<br/>
and, um, you know,<br/>
we can only hope<br/>
- that we find her.<br/>
- The ladder's gone.<br/>
- oh, no.<br/>
- I just did<br/>
what any good citizen<br/>
would have done.<br/>
And we can only hope that<br/>
they'll pull her out in time,<br/>
so she can be reunited<br/>
with her friends and loved ones.<br/>
Hey,<br/>
he's got something!<br/>
- ( gasps )<br/>
- okay, guys. Showtime.<br/>
( indistinct radio<br/>
transmission )<br/>
SToRM:<br/>
okay, are you getting this?<br/>
- ( squeaking )<br/>
- We got a floater.<br/>
( crowd laughing )<br/>
No, no, that's not possible.<br/>
No, she's up there.<br/>
Yeah, okay,<br/>
sweetie.<br/>
No, she's up there.<br/>
They know<br/>
what's going on.<br/>
They know exactly<br/>
what's going on.<br/>
Tell them. Tell them<br/>
how she's up there.<br/>
She's probably still<br/>
hiding under the water.<br/>
Go to commercial.<br/>
Daddy!<br/>
You know why?<br/>
Because she is a mermaid.<br/>
- ( laughing )<br/>
- Go to commercial.<br/>
Mermaid!<br/>
Mer-maid.<br/>
- ( laughing )<br/>
- Go to commercial now.<br/>
Fins and everything.<br/>
You've got to be<br/>
kidding me.<br/>
Give meyour keys.<br/>
No, Dad.<br/>
- Cecilia...<br/>
- No.<br/>
No, no, no, no, no.<br/>
Cecilia!<br/>
- ooh.<br/>
- Give me<br/>
your car keys... now!<br/>
( stifledsnickering )<br/>
( whimpering )<br/>
And while you're walking<br/>
to school every day,<br/>
you can try and<br/>
figure out why it is<br/>
you need so much attention.<br/>
( gasps )<br/>
Where could she be?<br/>
I don't know. Let's go.<br/>
It's a wrap.<br/>
on my career.<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
But, Daddy, my car!<br/>
Save it, Cecilia.<br/>
You know why?<br/>
Because she is a mermaid.<br/>
Go to commercial.<br/>
( Aquamarine and Leonard<br/>
laughing )<br/>
There's not usually a man with<br/>
a ladder around when you need him.<br/>
I can't thankyou enough.<br/>
I guess I could say<br/>
the same to you.<br/>
You're probably<br/>
the first person<br/>
who's talked to me all summer.<br/>
At least nicely.<br/>
I appreciate that.<br/>
You're a long way from home,<br/>
aren'tyou?<br/>
oh, thankyou!<br/>
( woman humming )<br/>
You know,<br/>
when you help<br/>
a mermaid,<br/>
you get a wish.<br/>
( cawing )<br/>
CLAI RE:<br/>
It's almost 9:30<br/>
and she's not here-<br/>
where else could she be?<br/>
Don't say it like<br/>
it's my fault.<br/>
- Shh! There's Ray.<br/>
- Yeah, I can see that. Thanks.<br/>
What is your problem?<br/>
I'm not giving up<br/>
this wish, Hailey.<br/>
She's here.<br/>
- ( whimpers )<br/>
- Hey!<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
- Hi.<br/>
I, um...<br/>
I thought aboutyou all night.<br/>
Good.<br/>
( laughing ):<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
So... what was it thatyou, um,<br/>
wanted to tell me?<br/>
or ask me?<br/>
I wasn't sure.<br/>
okay, here it goes.<br/>
The last couple of<br/>
days have been...<br/>
- amazing...<br/>
- Yeah, but wait...<br/>
Before we get<br/>
to that, uh,<br/>
could you maybe give me,<br/>
like, a 20-minute warning,<br/>
you know, before the part<br/>
whereyou run away.<br/>
( chuckling )<br/>
Don't worry, I don't<br/>
have to leave yet.<br/>
Cool, because<br/>
I was thinking, um,<br/>
maybe we could go<br/>
kite surfing.<br/>
Like, there's this really,<br/>
really awesome place<br/>
right down the shore-<br/>
okay, the waves are small...<br/>
CLAI RE:<br/>
Uh, wait.<br/>
...it sprays up into the air<br/>
and you can, like,<br/>
always see a rainbow there.<br/>
We're losing them.<br/>
I think she's about to ask him.<br/>
- I can't hear.<br/>
- Shh!<br/>
Come on. Let's go up top.<br/>
I mean, that's...<br/>
ifyou want to do that.<br/>
- I want to. Yeah.<br/>
- Yeah?<br/>
Cool, 'cause then, afterwards,<br/>
um, I know this great little...<br/>
Uh, actually, it's a total dive,<br/>
but they have<br/>
the best hot dogs ever.<br/>
- Raymond...<br/>
- Yeah?<br/>
I have to askyou something.<br/>
oh, right,<br/>
right, yeah.<br/>
okay, shoot.<br/>
I came here<br/>
looking for something...<br/>
I wasn't even sure existed.<br/>
But...<br/>
then I metyou,<br/>
and now I have to askyou.<br/>
Ask me.<br/>
- Try the binoculars.<br/>
- Don'tyell at me.<br/>
Raymond...<br/>
Yeah?<br/>

Uh...<br/>

What's going on?<br/>
But don't get me wrong,<br/>
don't get me wrong.<br/>
I like you.<br/>
I really, really likeyou.<br/>
Wait, I think he's, I think<br/>
he's reaching out for her.<br/>
That's a good sign. Look.<br/>
I mean, I think<br/>
you're smart and beautiful,<br/>
and different than<br/>
anyone I've ever met before,<br/>
and I'd like to see<br/>
a lot more ofyou.<br/>
But... you don't love me.<br/>
She's pulling away.<br/>
- Let me see what's going on.<br/>
- Wait, no.<br/>
Wait a minute.<br/>
Wait a minute.<br/>
Wait, wait, wait.<br/>
Hey... areyou crying?<br/>
Yes. Apparently,<br/>
it's something I do.<br/>
I don't understand.<br/>
I mean, why do I have<br/>
to be in love with you today?<br/>
Why can't we just...<br/>
Why can't we just...<br/>
- work ourway there?<br/>
- ( footsteps approaching )<br/>
CECI LIA:<br/>
I have a better idea.<br/>
Why doesn't she just go back<br/>
to where she came from?<br/>
( gasping )<br/>
- oh, no!<br/>
- No!<br/>
What the hell's<br/>
the matterwith you?<br/>
( gasps )<br/>
oh, my God.<br/>
Raymond! Raymond!<br/>
Just stay calm!<br/>
Don't fight the current.<br/>
I'll be<br/>
right there!<br/>
He still chooses her over me?<br/>
She's a fish!<br/>
( shrieks )<br/>
Raymond!<br/>
HAI LEY and CLAI RE:<br/>
Aqua! Aqua!<br/>
We're coming!<br/>
Her dad's<br/>
pulling her back.<br/>
RAY:<br/>
I'm going to get my rescue board!<br/>
We can't just let her go.<br/>
I'm going in.<br/>
No.<br/>
Not without me, you're not.<br/>
( gasping, coughing )<br/>
Hailey!<br/>
Hailey!<br/>
- Claire, come on.<br/>
- Hailey!<br/>
Claire!<br/>
Grab the buoy!<br/>
We'll meetyou there.<br/>
- ( coughing )<br/>
- I'm right here.<br/>
- I won't leave you.<br/>
- Hailey, I can't!<br/>
Keepyour eye on the buoy!<br/>
( grunting )<br/>
( coughing )<br/>
I'm coming.<br/>
Grab my hand.<br/>
Hailey!<br/>
You can do it.<br/>
I can't believe<br/>
you two.<br/>
It's not safe<br/>
out here.<br/>
The storm's<br/>
too strong.<br/>
Why is your dad<br/>
pulling you back now?<br/>
He can't just<br/>
takeyou away.<br/>
Yes, he can.<br/>
That was our deal.<br/>
Take ourwish...<br/>
- ( gasps )<br/>
- and you can stay here.<br/>
I can't.<br/>
Yeah, take it.<br/>
And you can call off<br/>
yourwedding.<br/>
But there's no wish.<br/>
- HAI LEY: What?!.<br/>
- Raymond doesn't love me.<br/>
My fatherwas right.<br/>
I couldn't prove love exists.<br/>
I'm so sorry.<br/>
- Can't we do something?!.<br/>
- Yeah, anything!<br/>
What more could you do for me?<br/>
You jumped<br/>
in the water to save me.<br/>
And nowyou'd<br/>
give meyourwish?<br/>
Whywould you do that for me?<br/>
I... I don't know.<br/>
I guess it's what<br/>
I would do for her, and...<br/>
I know she'd<br/>
do it for me,<br/>
and just...<br/>
because we loveyou, Aqua.<br/>
You do?<br/>
I didn't knowyou leak<br/>
when you're happy, too.<br/>
Look.<br/>
Your dad's<br/>
letting you go.<br/>
Because ofyou.<br/>
What?<br/>
Don'tyou see?<br/>
You just proved to him<br/>
that love exists.<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
I guess you get<br/>
a wish after all.<br/>
Any requests?<br/>
( chuckles )<br/>
Can we wish foryou<br/>
to stay here forever?<br/>
I'm a mermaid, Claire.<br/>
I have a family<br/>
out there that needs me.<br/>
Yeah.<br/>
As much as<br/>
I want to stay,<br/>
I belong in the ocean...<br/>
most ofthe time.<br/>
Saveyourwish, okay?<br/>
I promise<br/>
I'll come back to visit.<br/>
And ifl have to swim<br/>
against the GulfStream,<br/>
from here to Australia,<br/>
I'll do it.<br/>
I'd circle<br/>
theworld foryou two.<br/>
( quiet, gentle themeplaying )<br/>
So I guess this is it, right?<br/>
Someone's got to go back and<br/>
return all those wedding gifts.<br/>
We're gonna miss you, Aqua.<br/>
You can always<br/>
call me on my shell.<br/>
( laughing )<br/>
