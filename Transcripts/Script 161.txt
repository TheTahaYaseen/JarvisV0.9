<b>Kaecilius</b>: Hypocrite!
<i>[The Ancient One making a round pattern with both of his hands and turn the gravity as she hops off a wall of a building, and Kaecilius with his team do the same.

Kaecilius and the other are close to the position of falling, then Kaecilius makes a portal with a round and round pattern with his hand for him and his team to escape. then they hop onto that with Kaecilius still holding it open as The Ancient One still fighting three of them left. then Kaecilius hops onto the portal and closes it as The Ancient One knocks out the three people, and stares as the portal closes. then The Ancient One rewinds the rolling building and makes it as if none of this happened and hops of the building to the ground and she makes a portal out of the mirror universe to the real universe and walks through the street and removes her hood, revealing her bald head]</i>

<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Challenge round, Billy.
<i>[Billy playing the other song]</i>
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh, come on, Billy. You’ve got to be messing with me.
<b>Billy</b>: Heheh. No, doctor.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Feels So Good, Chuck Mangione, 1977. Seriously, Billy, you said this one would be hard.
<b>Billy</b>: Hah! It’s 1978.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: No, Billy, while Feels So Good may have charted in 1978, the album was released in December, 1977.
<b>Billy</b>: No, no. Wikipedia says the…
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Check again.
<b>Billy</b>: When did you…?
<b>Doctor that is helping Stephen</b>: Where do you store all this useless information?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Useless? The man charted a top ten hit with a Flugelhorn. Status, Billy?
<b>Dr. Billy</b>: 1977.
<b>Doctor that is helping Stephen</b>: Oh! Please. I hate you.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Woah! "Feels so good", doesn’t it?
[someone looking through the door’s glass]
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh, I…
<b>Doctor that is helping Stephen</b>: I’ve got this, Stephen. You’ve done your bit. Go ahead, we’ll close up.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: What is that?<i> [Christine hands him the device showing the patient's situation.]</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: GSW.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: It’s amazing you kept him alive. Apneic, further brain stem testing after reflex test… I think I found the problem, Dr. Palmer. You left a bullet in his head.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Thanks. It’s impinging on the medulla. I needed a specialist to diagnose brain death. Something about that doesn’t feel right to me.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: We have to run.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Dr. West! What are you doing? Hey!
<b>Dr. West</b>: Organ harvesting. He’s a donor.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Slow down. I did not agree to that.
<b>Dr. West</b>: I don’t need you to. We’ve already called brain death.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Prematurely. We need to get him prepped for a suboccipital craniotomy.
<b>Dr. West</b>: I’m not going to let you operate on a dead man.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: <i>[Holds up the scan of the patient's brain.]</i> What do you see?
<b>Dr. West</b>: A bullet?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: A perfect bullet. It’s been hardened. You harden a bullet by alloying lead with antimony. A toxic metal. And it's leaking directly into the cerebral spinal fluid.
<b>Dr. West</b>: Rapid-onset central nervous system shutdown. 
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: We need to go.
<b>october Strange</b>: The patient’s not dead, but he’s dying. Do you still want to harvest his organs?
<b>Dr. West</b>: I’ll assist you.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: <i>[Wheels the patient's bed down the hallway, Christine follows him.]</i> No! Dr. Palmer will assist me.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Thank you. <i>[Begins to hook the patient up to devices.]</i> Image status, STAT.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: We do not have time for that.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: You can’t do it freehand.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: I can and I will.
<b>Dr. West: </b>This isn’t the time for showing off, Strange.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: How about 10 minutes ago, when you called the wrong time of death? <i>[Selects a pair of bent scissors and inspects the patient's brain on a screen.]</i> Cranial nerves intact. <i>[He artfully reaches into the brian with the thin scissors. There is a loud ticking noise coming from Dr. west's watch. He doesn't look away from the patient.]</i> Dr. West, cover your watch.
<i>[Dr. West slides a hand over his expensive watch. Back to Stephen Strange, who is delicately performing the surgery's. His steady hand reaches in, and the scissors clasp around the billet. He slowly draws out th scissors and opens them, dropping the all blue bullet into a tray. It's out. Cheers fill the room.]</i>
[Doctor Palmer and Doctor Strange walk down the hospital hallway, talking to each other.]<i></i>
Christine Palmer: You know, you didn’t have to humiliate him in front of everyone.
Doctor Strange: I didn’t have to save his patient either. <i>[He dances slightly as when walks.]</i> But, you know, sometimes I just can’t help myself.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Nick is a great doctor.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You came to me.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Yeah, well, I needed a second opinion.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You had a second opinion. What you needed was a competent one.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Well, all the more reason you should be my neurosurgeon on call. You could make such a difference.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: I can’t work in your butcher shop.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: <i>[slightly offended]</i> Hey! Look, he…
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Look, I’m fusing transected spinal cords. I'm stimulating neurogenesis in the central nervous system. The work I'm doing is gonna save thousands for years to come. In ER, you get to save one drunk idiot with a gun.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Yeah, you’re right. In the ER, you’re only saving lives. There’s no fame, there’s no CNN interviews… Well, I guess I’ll have to stick with Nick.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Wait a minute. You’re not…you guys aren’t…
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: What?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Sleeping together. Sorry, I thought that was implicit in my disgust.
<b>Crhstine Palmer</b>: Explicit, actually. And no, I have a very strict rule against dating colleagues.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh really?
<i>[They come to a stop outside of Christine's post.]</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: I call it the Strange policy.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh, good! I’m glad something is named after me. You know, I invented a laminectomy procedure, and yet, somehow, no one seems to want to call it the Strange technique.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: We invented that technique.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You know, I gotta say, I’m very flattered by your policy. Look, I’m talking tonight at a Neurological Society dinner. Come with me.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Another speaking engagement? So romantic.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You used to love going to those things with me. We had fun together.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: No. You had fun. They weren’t about us, they were about you.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Not only about me.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Stephen. Everything is about you.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Maybe we can hyphenate. Strange-Palmer technique. 
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: <i>[She walks as away, but looks back over her shoulder, grinning.]</i> Palmer-Strange.
<i>[He grins too. he's gotten her.]</i>
<i>[We see a fancy, expensive apartment--huge windows looking out on a beautiful city, and Doctor Strange walks in front of the windows, arrogance in his step. Switch scenes to show him pulling open a drawer full of twenty or so watches, rotating on their display. He wonders for a moment and then picks an especially expensive looking one. Switch setting to show him driving recklessly out of his apartment building's driveway in an expensive car. Later, on the road, he is still driving just as recklessly, but in the rainy darkness.]</i>
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: <i>[To Billy, on the phone.]</i> Billy! What have you got for me?
<b>Billy</b>: I’ve got a 35-year-old Air Force colonel. Crushed his lower spine in some kind of experimental armor. Mid-thoracic vertebral fracture.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Well, I could help, but so can 50 other people. Find me something worth my time.
<b>Billy</b>: I have a 68-year-old female with an advanced brain stem glioma.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Yeah, you want me to screw up my perfect record? Definitely not.
<b>Billy</b>: How about a 22-year-old female with an electronic implant in her brain to control schizophrenia struck by lightning?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: That does sound interesting. Could you send me the… <i>[His phone screen lights up with the patient's documents]</i> got it. Hey.
<i>[Another car appears on the road. Doctor Strange swerves out of the way and goes off the road, off the side of a mountain. The car crashes, Stephen blacks out]</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: <i>[Stephen wakes up in a hospital bed and see his hands in traction. Christine is next to his bed.]</i> It’s okay. It’s going to be okay.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: <i>[hoarsely]</i>What did they do?
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: They rushed you in a chopper. But it took a little while to find you. Golden hours for nerve damage went by while you were in the car.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: What did they do?!?
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: 11 stainless steel pins in the bones. Multiple torn ligaments. Severe nerve damage in both hands. You were on the table for 11 hours.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Look at these fixators.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: No one could have done better.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: I could have done better.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: No. No.
<i>[A scene later in time. All Stephen's wounds are gone, except for the shaking in his ruined hands.]</i>
<b>Doctor</b>: Give your body time to heal.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You ruined me. How long until I’m…
<i>[Doctor Strange's apartment, where a team of doctors are gathered around his table.]</i>
<b>Doctor One</b>: Doctor Strange… those tissues are still healing.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: So speed it up. Pass the stent under the brachial artery under the radial artery.
<b>Doctor Two</b>: It’s possible. Experimental and expensive, but possible.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: All I need is possible.
<i>[Doctor Strange has metal around his hand, pulling his fingers in, and he is excercising his weak hands by trying to fight against them. He is being supervised by a young doctor.]</i>
<b>Young Doctor</b>: Up. Up. Show me your strength.
<i>[Doctor Strange groans in frustration, and his hands close.]</i>
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange</b>: Ah! It’s useless.
<b>Young Doctor</b>: It’s not useless, man, you can do this.
<i>[He tries again, but he's annoyed. And still arrogant.]</i>
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Then answer me this, bachelor’s degree. Have you ever known anyone with nerve damage this severe to do this, and actually recover?
<b>Young Doctor</b>: One guy, yeah. Factory accident, broke his back. Paralyzed. His leg wasted away. He had pain in his shoulder from the wheelchair. He came in 3 times a week. But one day he stopped coming. I thought he was dead. A few years later, he walked past me on the street.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: He walked? 
<b>Young Doctor</b>: Yeah, he walked.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Bullshit. Show me his file.
<b>Young Doctor</b>: It can take me a while to pull the files from the archive. But if it proves your arrogant ass wrong, it’s worth it.
<i>[Dr. Strange is having a conversation with an elite doctor through his tablet. As he does so, right particles writing his name with his trembling hand.]</i>
<b>Etienne</b>: I looked at all your research. I read all the papers you’ve sent, but… none will work. I… I don’t think you realize how severe the damage is, I…
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Look, here’s the thing, I…
<b>Etienne</b>: At best, I’d try and fail. Look, I understand. Here’s the thing. I… What you want from me is impossible, Stephen.
<b>Doctor Strange</b> Come on…
<b>Etienne</b>: I’ve got my own reputation to consider.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Etienne, wait.
<b>Etienne</b>:I can’t help you…
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: No. No, no, wait!
<i>[Too late. Etienne hangs up. Doctor Strange yells in frustration and knocks the tablet and the papers he's been practicing on off of the table. He sits there a moment, defeated, before the door opens and Christine walks in.]</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Hi. <i>[Seeing his face.]</i> He won’t do it.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: He’s a hack. There’s a new procedure in Tokyo. They culture donor stem cells and then harvest them and 3D-print a scaffold. If I could get a loan together, just…
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Stephen…
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: A small loan, 200,000.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Stephen. You’ve always spent money as fast as you could make it but now you’re spending money you don’t even have. Maybe it’s time to consider stopping
.<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: No. Now is exactly the time not to stop. Because, you see, I’m not getting any better! <i>[He goldsmith up his shaking hands angrily.]</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: But this isn’t medicine anymore. This is mania. Some things just can’t be fixed
.<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Life without my work…
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Is still life. This isn’t the end. There are other things that can give your life meaning.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>:<i>[Spitefully]</i>Like what? Like <i>you?</i>
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: And this is the part where you apologize.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: This is the part where you leave.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Fine. I can’t watch you do this to yourself anymore. <i>[She move soon to leave.]</i>
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Too difficult for you, is it?
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Yes. It is. And it breaks my heart to see you this way.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: No. Don’t pity me.
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: I’m not pitying you.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh yeah? Then what are you doing here? Bringing cheese and wine as if we’re old friends going for a picnic? We are not friends, Christine. We were barely lovers. You just love a sob story, don’t you? Is that what I am to you now? Poor Stephen Strange, charity case. He finally needs me. Another dregmof humanity for you to work on. Fix him up and send him back into the world, heart is just humming… <i>[Shouting]</i> You care <i>so</i> much, don't you?!?
<b>Christine Palmer</b>: Goodbye, Stephen. <i>[She drops her keys to his apartment on the the table and stalks out. He stared out ant the city, his hands still shaking. Zoom in on the paper on the floor, where writing out his name. The lines are shaky, incomplete, and illegible.]</i>
<i>[Doctor Strange sifts through medical files with his trembling hands. He finds a couple of files with a post-it notebook on it that reads "Told you so!"]</i>
<i>[A basketball court, with men playing basketball and shouting at each other. Is Doctor Strange's jealous of how carefree and active they are?]</i>
<b>Man 1</b>: Come on, man! Where is the competition?
<b>Man 2</b>: You talk a lot!
<i>[One then a walks over to the edge of the four court to a drink  of water even water. Doctor Strange approaches him through the fence.</i>
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Jonathan Pangborn, C7-C8 spinal cord injury, complete.
<b>Pangborn</b>: Who are you?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Paralyzed from the mid-chest down. Partial paralysis of both hands.
<b>Pangborn</b>: I don’t know you.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: I’m Stephen Strange. I’m a neurosurgeon. <i>Was</i> a neurosurgeon.
<b>Pangborn</b>: Actually, you know what, man? I think I know you. I came to your office once. You refused to see me. I never got past your assistant
.<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You were untreatable.
<b>Pangborn</b>: No glory for you in that, right?
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: You came back from a place there is no way back from! I… I’m trying to find my own way back.
Hey, Pangborn, you in it or not?
<b>Pangborn: </b>Alright. I’d given up on my body. I thought my mind was the only thing I had left. I should at least try to elevate that. So I sat with gurus, and sacred women. Strangers carried me to mountain tops to see holy men. And finally, I found my teacher. And my mind was elevated. And my spirit deepened. And somehow…
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange</b>: Your body healed. 
<b>Pangborn: </b>Yes. And there were deeper secrets to learn then, but I did not have the strength to receive them. I chose to settle for my miracle, and I came back home. The place you’re looking for is called Kamar-Taj. But the cost is high.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>How much?
<b>Pangborn: </b>I’m not talking about money. Good luck.
Give me the ball!
Kathmandu, Nepal
Excuse me. Kamar-Taj?
Do you know where Kamar-Taj is?
Sign: "Himalayan Healing!
Find Peace! Find Yourself!"
Kamar-Taj?
Kamar-Taj…
Okay.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Guys, I… I don’t have any money.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, please. It’s all I have left.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>All right.
<b>Mordo: </b>You’re looking for Kamar-Taj?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Really? Are you sure you got the right place? That one looks a little more...Kamar-Taj-y.
<b>Mordo: </b>I once stood in your place. And I, too, was… disrespectful. So might I offer you some advice Forget everything you think you know.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Uh… alright.
<b>Mordo: </b>The sanctuary of our teacher, the Ancient One.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>The Ancient One? What’s his real name? Right. Forget everything I think I know. I’m sorry. Thank you for… huh! Okay, that’s, uh… a thing…Thank you. Hello. Uh, thank you. And thank you. Uh, thank you, Ancient One…for… seeing me…
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You’re very welcome. Thank you, Master Mordo. Thank you, Master Hamir. Mr. Strange!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Doctor, actually.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Well, no. Not anymore, surely. Isn’t that why you’re here? You’ve undergone many procedures. Seven, right?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah…Good tea.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Yes.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Did you heal a man named Pangborn? A paralyzed man?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>In a way.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You helped him to walk again.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Yes. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>How do you correct a complete C7-C8 spinal cord injury?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Oh, I didn’t correct it. He couldn’t walk; I convinced him that he could.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You’re not suggesting it was psychosomatic?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>When you reattach a severed nerve, is it you who heals it back together or the body?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>It’s the cells.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>And the cells are only programmed to put themselves together in very specific ways.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>That’s right. 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>What if I told you that your own body could be convinced to put itself back together in all sorts of ways?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You’re talking about cellular regeneration. That’s… bleeding-edge medical tech. Is that why you’re working here, without a governing medical board? I mean… just how experimental is your treatment?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Quite.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>So, you figured out a way to reprogram nerve cells to self-heal?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>No, Mr. Strange. I know how to reorient the spirit to better heal the body.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Spirit… to heal the body. Huh. A… Al… Al… alright. How do we do that? Where do we start?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Don’t like that map?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Oh, no. It’s… it’s very good. It’s just…you know, I’ve seen it before. In gift shops.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>And what about this one?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Acupuncture, great. - Yeah?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>What about… that one?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You’re showing me an MRI scan? I can not believe this.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Each of those maps was drawn up by someone who could see in part, but not the whole.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I spent my last dollar getting here on a one-way ticket, and you’re talking to me about healing through belief?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You’re a man who’s looking at the world through a keyhole, and you spent your whole life trying to widen that keyhole. To see more, know more. And now, on hearing that it can be widened in ways you can’t imagine, you reject the possibility?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, I reject it because I do not believe in fairy tales about chakras, or energy, or the power of belief. There is no such thing as spirit! We are made of matter, and nothing more. We’re just another tiny, momentary speck within an indifferent universe.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You think too little of yourself.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Oh, you think you see through me, do you? Well, you don’t. But I see through you!!! What did you just do to me?!? 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I pushed your astral form out of your physical form.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What’s in that tea? Psilocybin? LSD?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Just tea. With a little honey.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What just happened? 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>For a moment, you entered the astral dimension.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What?? 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>A place where the soul exists apart from the body.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Why are you doing this to me?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>To show you just how much you don’t know. Open your eye.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No! No… No! Shit! Oh god! Oh god! Oh god! This isn’t real it isn’t real it isn’t
<b>Mordo: </b>His heart rate are getting dangerously high.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>He looks alright to me. You think you know how the world works? You think that this material universe is all there is? What is real? What mysteries lie beyond the reach of your senses? At the root of existence, mind and matter meet. Thoughts shape reality. This universe is only one of an infinite number. Worlds without end. Some benevolent and life-giving, others filled with malice and hunger. Dark places, where powers older than time lie… ravenous… and waiting. Who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange? Have you seen that before in a gift shop?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Teach me!
<b>The Ancient One: </b>No.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No… No! No, no, no, no no no no! No! Open the door! Please!
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Thank you, Masters. You think I’m wrong to cast him out?
<b>Mordo: </b>5 hours later, he’s still on your doorstep. There’s a strength to him.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Stubbornness, arrogance, ambition…I’ve seen it all before.
<b>Mordo: </b>He reminds you of Kaecilius?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I can not lead another gifted student to power, only to lose him to the darkness.
<b>Mordo: </b>You didn’t lose me. I wanted the power to defeat my enemies. You gave me the power to defeat my demons. And to live within the natural law.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>We never lose our demons, Mordo. We only learn to live above them.
<b>Mordo: </b>Kaecilius still has the stolen pages. If he deciphers them, he could bring ruin upon us all. There may be dark days ahead. Perhaps Kamar-Taj could use a man like Strange.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Don’t shut me out. I’ve nowhere else to go. Thank you.
<b>Mordo: </b>Bathe, rest, meditate if you can. The Ancient One will send for you.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Uh, what’s this? My mantra?
<b>Mordo: </b>The Wi-Fi password. We’re not savages.
Time will tell how much I love you.
- Christine
<b>The Ancient One: </b>The language of the mystic arts is as old as civilization. The sorcerers of antiquity called the use of this language "spells". But if that word offends your modern sensibilities, you can call it "program". The source code that shapes reality. We harness energy drawn from other dimensions of the multiverse, to cast spells, conjure shields and weapons to make magic.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>But… even if my fingers could do that, My hands would just be waving in the air. I mean, how do I get from here to there?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>How did you get to reattach severed nerves, and put a human spine back together bone by bone?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Study and practice. Years of it. Hey.
<b>Wong: </b>Mr. Strange.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Uh… Stephen, please. And you are?
<b>Wong: </b>Wong. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong. Just Wong? Like… Adele? Or… Aristotle. Drake. Bono. Eminem.
<b>Wong: </b>The Book of the Invisible Sun, Astronomia Nova, Codex Imperium, Key of Solomon. You finished all of this?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yup.
<b>Wong: </b>Come with me.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Alright.
<b>Wong: </b>This section is for Masters only. But at my discretion, others may use it. We should start with Maxim’s Primer. How is your Sanskrit?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’m fluent in Google Translate.
<b>Wong: </b>Read it. Classical Sanskrit.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What are those?
<b>Wong: </b>The Ancient One’s private collection.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>So they’re forbidden?
<b>Wong: </b>No knowledge in Kamar-Taj is forbidden. Only certain practices. Those books are far too advanced for anyone other than the Sorcerer Supreme.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>This one’s got pages missing.
<b>Wong: </b>That’s the book of Cagliostro. The study of time. One of the rituals was stolen by a former Master. A zealot called Kaecilius. Just after he strung up the former librarian, and relieved him of his head. I’m now the guardian of these books. So if a volume from this collection should be stolen again, I’d know it. And you’d be dead before you ever left the compound.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What if it’s just overdue? You know? Any… late fees I should know about? Maybe, perhaps, uhm…Uh, you know, people used to think that I was funny.
<b>Wong: </b>Did they work for you?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Alright. Well, it’s been lovely talking to you, thank you for the books and for the horrifying story and for the threat upon my life.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Now we receive the power to destroy the one who betrayed us. The one who betrays the world.
<b>Mordo: </b>Mastery of the sling ring is essential to the mystic arts. They allow us to travel throughout the multiverse. All you need to do is focus. Visualize. See the destination in your mind. Look beyond the world in front of you. Imagine every detail. The clearer the picture, the quicker, and easier, the gateway will come. And stop.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I’d like a moment alone with Mr. Strange.
<b>Mordo: </b>Of course.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>My hands.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>It’s not about your hands.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>How is this not about my hands?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Master Hamir. Thank you, Master Hamir. You cannot beat a river into submission. You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I… I control it by surrendering control? That doesn’t make any sense.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Not everything does. Not everything has to. Your intellect has taken you far in life. But it will take you no further. Surrender, Stephen. Silence your ego and your power will rise. Come with me.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wait. Is this…
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Everest. It’s beautiful. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah, you’re right. Beautiful. It’s freezing, but… beautiful.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>At this temperature, a person can last for 13 minutes before suffering permanent loss of function. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Great.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>But you will likely go into shock within the first 2 minutes. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Surrender, Stephen.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, no!!! Don’t!
<b>Mordo: </b>How is our new recruit?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>We shall see. Any second now.
<b>Mordo: </b>No, not again. Maybe I should…
<b>Wong: </b>Stephen.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong.
<b>Wong: </b>What do you want, Strange?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Books on astral projection.
<b>Wong: </b>You’re not ready for that.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Try me, Beyonce. Come on. You’ve heard of her. She’s a huge star, right? Do you ever laugh? Oh come on, just give me the book, huh?
<b>Wong: </b>No.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Once, in this room, you begged me to let you learn. Now I’m told you question every lesson, preferring to teach yourself.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Once, in this room, you told me to open my eyes. Now I’m being told to blindly accept rules that make no sense.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Like the rule against conjuring a gateway in the library?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong told on me? 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You’re advancing quickly with your sorcery skills. You need a safe space to practice your spells. You are now inside the Mirror Dimension. Ever present but undetected. The real world isn’t affected by what happens here. We use the Mirror Dimension to train, surveil, and sometimes to contain threats. You don’t want to be stuck in here without your sling ring.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Hold on. Sorry, what do you mean, threats?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Learning of an infinite multiverse included learning of infinite dangers. And if I told you everything else that you don’t already know, you’d run from here in terror.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>So, just how ancient is she?
<b>Mordo: </b>No one knows the age of the Sorcerer Supreme. Only that she is Celtic and never talks about her past.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You follow her even though you don’t know?
<b>Mordo: </b>I know that she’s steadfast, but unpredictable. Merciless, yet kind. She made me what I am. Trust your teacher. And don’t lose your way.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Like Kaecilius?
<b>Mordo: </b>That’s right.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You knew him.
<b>Mordo: </b>When he first came to us, he’d lost everyone he ever loved. He was a grieving and broken man, searching for answers in the mystic arts. A brilliant student, but he was proud, headstrong. Questioned the Ancient One, rejected our teaching. He left Kamar-Taj. His disciples followed him like sheep, seduced by false doctrine.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>He stole the forbidden ritual, right?
<b>Mordo: </b>Yeah.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What did it do?
<b>Mordo: </b>No more questions.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What’s that?
<b>Mordo: </b>That’s a question. This is a relic. Some magic is too powerful to sustain, so we imbue objects with it, allowing them to take the strain we can not. This is the Staff of the Living Tribunal. There are many relics: the Wand of Watoomb, the Bolting Boots of Voltor.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>They just roll of the tongue, don’t they? When do I get my relic?
<b>Mordo: </b>When you’re ready.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I think I’m ready.
<b>Mordo: </b>You’re ready when the relic decides you’re ready. For now, conjure a weapon.
Yeah.
<b>Mordo: </b>Fight! Fight like your life depended on it! Because one day, it may.
Christine
I’m emailing you one more time to
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong? Okay. First, open the Eye of Agamotto. All right. Oh my. Dormammu. The Dark Dimension. Eternal life?
[after Strange has been caught reading the text Kaecilius stole and learning to bend time with the mystical Eye of Agamotto]
<b>Mordo</b>: Stop!!!
Tampering with the continuum of probability is forbidden!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I… I wa… I was just doing exactly what it said in the book!
And what did the book say about the dangers of performing that ritual?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah, I don’t know. I hadn’t gotten to that part yet.
Temporal manipulations can create branches in time. Unstable dimensional openings. Spacious paradoxes! Time loops!!!
<b>Mordo: </b>You want to get stuck reliving the same moment over, and over, forever, or never having existed at all?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>They really should put the warnings before that stuff.
Your curiosity could have gotten you killed.
You weren’t manipulating the space-time continuum, you were wrecking it.
We do not tamper with natural law. We defend it.
How did you learn to do that?
Where did you learn the litany of spells required to even understand it?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’ve got a photographic memory. It’s how I got my M.D. and Ph.D. at the same time.
<b>Mordo: </b>What you just did takes more than a good memory. You were born for the mystic arts.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>And yet, my hands still shake.
- For now, yes.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Not forever?
<b>Mordo: </b>We’re not prophets.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>When do you start telling me what we are?
While heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers, we sorcerers safeguard it against more mystical threats.
The Ancient One is the latest in a long line of Sorcerers Supreme, going back thousands of years
to the father of the mystic arts, the mighty Agamotto.
The same sorcerer who created the eye you so recklessly borrowed.
Agamotto built 3 Sanctums in places of power, where great cities now stand.
That door leads to the Hong Kong Sanctum, that door to the New York Sanctum. That one, to the London Sanctum.
Together, the Sanctums generate a protective shield around our world.
<b>Mordo: </b>The Sanctums protect the world, and we sorcerers protect the Sanctums.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>From what?
Other-dimensional beings that threaten our universe.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Like Dormammu?
Where did you learn that name?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I just read it in The Book of Cagliostro. Why?
Dormammu dwells in the Dark Dimension, beyond time.
He is the cosmic conquerer, the destroyer of worlds.
A being of infinite power and endless hunger, on a quest to invade every universe and bring all worlds into his Dark Dimension.
And he hungers for Earth most of all.
The pages that Kaecilius stole.
A ritual to contact Dormammu and draw power from the Dark Dimension.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Uuuh… okay. Okay. I… time-out. I… I came here to heal my hands, not to fight in some mystical war.
London.
Kaecilius!
No!!!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong? Mordo?
177A Bleecker Street
Hello?
Hello?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Daniel. I see they made you Master of the Sanctum.
<b>Master: </b>Do you know what that means?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>That you’ll die protecting it.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Stop!
<b>Kaecilius: </b>How long have you been at Kamar-TaJ, Mister…?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Doctor.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Mister Doctor?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>It’s Strange.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Maybe. Who am I to judge? You don’t know how to use that, do you?
What?
You’ll die here.
- Oh, stop it.
I said, stop it!
<b>Kaecilius: </b>You cannot stop this, Mr. Doctor. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Why…look, I don’t even know what "this" is.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>It’s the end and the beginning. The many becoming the few, becoming the One.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Look, if you’re not going to start making sense, I’m just going to have to put this thing back on.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Tell me, Mr. Doctor.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Alright, look. My name is Dr. Stephen Strange.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>You are a doctor?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yes. 
<b>Kaecilius: </b>A scientist. You understand the laws of nature. All things age. All things die. In the end, our sun burns out, our universe grows cold and perishes. But the Dark Dimension… it’s a place beyond time.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>That’s it. I’m putting this thing back on.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>This world doesn’t have to die, Doctor. This world can take its rightful place among so many others, as part of the One. The great and beautiful One. And we can all live forever.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Really? What do you have to gain out of this New Age dimensional utopia?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>The same as you. The same as everyone. Life. Eternal life. People think in terms of good and evil, but really, time is the true enemy of us all. Time kills everything.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What about the people you killed?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Tiny, momentary specks within an indifferent universe. Yes. You see, you see what we’re doing? The world is not what it ought to be. Humanity longs for the eternal, for a world beyond time, because time is what enslaves us. Time is an insult. Death is an insult. Doctor…We don’t seek to rule this world. We seek to save it, to hand it over to Dormammu, who is the intent of all evolution, the Why of all existence.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>The Sorcerer Supreme defends existence.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>What was it that brought you to Kamar-Taj, Doctor? Was it enlightenment? Power? You came to be healed, as did we all. Kamar-Taj is a place that collects broken things. We all come with the promise of being healed, but instead, the Ancient One gives us parlor tricks. The real magic she keeps for herself. Have you ever wondered how she managed to live this long?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I… I saw the rituals in the book of Cagliostro.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>So, you know. The ritual gives me the power to overthrow the Ancient One and tear her Sanctums down, to let the Dark Dimension in. Because what the Ancient One hoards, Dormammu gives freely: life, everlasting. He is not the destroyer of worlds, Doctor, he is the savior of worlds.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No. I mean, come on. Look at your face. Dormammu made you a murderer. Just how good can his kingdom be? You think that’s funny?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>No. No, Doctor. What’s funny is that you’ve lost your sling ring.
Sir, can I help you?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Dr. Palmer, where is she?
Sir, we need to…
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Where is she?
- At the nurses station.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Christine!
<b>Christine: </b>Stephen? Oh my god. What…
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>We need to get me on an operation table now. Just you. Now! I don’t have any time!
<b>Christine: </b>What happened?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Stabbed. Cardiac tamponade.
<b>Christine: </b>What are you wearing?
The chest cavity is clear.
- The blood… is in the pericardial sac.
No. No no no no no no no!
<b>Christine: </b>Stephen! Stephen!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Just a little higher. Please be careful with the needle.
<b>Christine: </b>Stephen? Oh lord, oh lord. What am I seeing?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>My astral body.
<b>Christine: </b>Are you dead?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, Christine, but I am dying.
Right. Right.
Yeah. Alright.
<b>Christine: </b>I’ve… I’ve never seen a wound like this before. What were you stabbed with?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I don’t know. I’m going to have to vanish now.
<b>Christine: </b>No, I…
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Keep me alive, will you?
<b>Christine: </b>Okay! Okay.
Oh shit!
Charging to 200 Joule
<b>Christine: </b>Stephen, come on.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Hit me again!
<b>Christine: </b>Stop doing that!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Up the voltage and hit me again.
<b>Christine: </b>No, your heart is beating!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Just do it!
Oh god!
Are you ok?
- Hey there.
Okay.
<b>Christine: </b>After all this time, you just show up here, flying out of your body?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah, I know. I missed you too, by the way. I wrote 2 emails, but you never responded.
<b>Christine: </b>Why would I?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Christine, I am so, so sorry. For all of it. And you were right, I was a complete asshole. I treated you so horribly and you deserved so much more.
<b>Christine: </b>Stop. You… you’re clearly in shock. I mean, what the hell is happening? Where have you been?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Well, after Western medicine failed me, I headed East, and I ended up in Kathmandu.
<b>Christine: </b>Kathmandu?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah.
<b>Christine: </b>What, like the Bob Seger song?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>1975, Beautiful Loser, side A. And then, I went to a place called Kamar-Taj and I talked to someone called the Ancient One, and…
<b>Christine: </b>Oh. So you joined a cult.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, I didn’t. Not exactly. I mean, they did teach me to tap into powers that I never even knew existed.
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah, that sounds like a cult.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>It’s not a cult.
<b>Christine: </b>Well, that’s what a cultist would say.
- Oh, no.
<b>Christine: </b>Wait, Stephen… what do you think you’re doing?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’m late for a cult meeting.
<b>Christine: </b>This is insane.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah.
<b>Christine: </b>Where are you going?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Uhm…
<b>Christine: </b>Just tell me the truth?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Well, a powerful sorcerer, who gave himself over to an ancient entity who can bend the very laws of physics, tried very hard to kill me, but I left him chained up in Greenwich Village, and the quickest way back there is through a dimensional gateway that I opened up in the mop closet.
<b>Christine: </b>Okay. Don’t tell me. Fine.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I really do have to go.
<b>Mordo: </b>Strange! You’re okay.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>A relative term, but yeah, I’m okay.
<b>Mordo: </b>The Cloak of Levitation. It came to you.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>No minor feat. It’s a fickle thing.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>He’s escaped.
- Kaecilius?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah. He can fold space and matter at will.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>He folds matter outside the mirror dimension? In the real world?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>How many more?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Two. I stranded one in the desert.
And the other?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>His body was in the hall. Master Drumm was in the foyer.
<b>Mordo: </b>He’s been taken back to Kamar-Taj.
The London Sanctum has fallen.
Only New York and Hong Kong remain now to shield us from the Dark Dimension.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You defended the New York Sanctum from attack. With its Master gone, it needs another, Master Strange.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No. It is Dr. Strange. Not Master Strange, not Mr. Strange, Doctor Strange. When I became a doctor, I swore an oath to do no harm. And I have just killed a man! I’m not doing that again. I became a doctor to save lives, not take them.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You become a doctor to save one life above all others: your own.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Still seeing through me, are you?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I see what I’ve always seen: your over-inflated ego. You want to go back to the delusion that you can control anything, even death, which no one can control. Not even the great Doctor Stephen Strange.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Not even Dormammu? He offers immortality.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>It’s our fear of death that gives Dormammu life. He feeds off it.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Like you feed on him? You talk to me about controlling death. Well, I know how you do it. I’ve seen the missing rituals from The Book of Cagliostro.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Measure your next words very carefully, doctor.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Because you might not like them?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Because you may not know of what you speak.
<b>Mordo: </b>What is he talking about?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’m talking about her long life, the source of her immortality. She draws power from the Dark Dimension to stay alive.
<b>Mordo: </b>That’s not true.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’ve seen the rituals and worked them out. I know how you do it.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Once they regroup, the zealots will be back. You’ll need reinforcements.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>She is not who you think she is.
<b>Mordo: </b>You don’t have the right to say that. You have no idea of the responsibility that rests upon her shoulders.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, and I don’t want to know.
<b>Mordo: </b>You’re a coward.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Because I’m not a killer?
<b>Mordo: </b>These zealots will snuff us all out, and you can muster the strength to snuff them out first?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What do you think I just did?
<b>Mordo: </b>You saved your own life! And then whined about it like a wounded dog.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>When you would have done it so easily?
<b>Mordo: </b>You have no idea the things I’ve done…And the answer is yes. Without hesitation.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Even if there’s another way?
<b>Mordo: </b>There is no other way.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You lack imagination.
<b>Mordo: </b>No, Stephen. You lack a spine. They’re back. We have to end this. Now! Strange! Get down here and fight!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>The Mirror Dimension. You can’t affect the real world in here. Who’s laughing now, asshole?
<b>Kaecilius: </b>I am.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>They’ve got no sling ring. I mean, they can’t escape, right?
Run!
<b>Mordo: </b>Their connection to the Dark Dimension makes them more powerful in the Mirror Dimension. They can’t affect the real world, but they can still kill us. This wasn’t clever. This was suicide!
That is hilarious.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>This was a mistake.
<b>Mordo: </b>It’s true. She does draw power from the Dark Dimension.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Kaecilius.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>I came to you broken, lost, bleeding. I trusted you to be my teacher, and you fed me lies.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I tried to protect you.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>From the truth? 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>From yourself.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>I have a new teacher now.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Dormammu deceives you You have no idea of what he truly is. His eternal life is not paradise, but torment.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Liar.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Christine!!!
<b>Christine: </b>Are you kidding me? Oh my god.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No fibrillation…
<b>Christine: </b>It’s neurogenic?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yes. Nick? We need to relieve the pressure on her brain.
She still drops.
We’re losing her!
- You need to increase her oxygen!
I need a crash cart!
- Her pupils are dilated!
No reflexes.
I’m not reading any brain activity.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What are you doing? You’re dying! You have to return to your body now. You don’t have time.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Time is relative. Your body hasn’t even hit the floor yet. I’ve spent so many years peering through time, looking at this exact moment. But I can’t see past it. I’ve prevented countless terrible futures. And after each one, there’s always another. And they all lead here, but never further.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You think this is where you die.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Do you wonder what I see in your future?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No. Yes. 
<b>The Ancient One: </b>I never saw your future, only its possibilities. You have such a capacity for goodness. You always excelled, but not because you crave success, but because of your fear of failure.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>It’s what made me a great doctor.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>It’s precisely what kept you from greatness. Arrogance and fear still keep you from learning the simplest and most significant lesson of all.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Which is?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>It’s not about you. When you first came to me, you asked me how I was able to heal Jonathan Pangborn. I didn’t. He channels dimensional energy directly into his own body.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange:</b>He uses magic to walk.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Constantly. He had a choice: to return to to his own life, or to serve something greater than himself.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>So, I could have my hands back again? My old life?
<b>The Ancient One: </b>You could. And the world would be all the lesser for it. I’ve hated drawing power from the Dark Dimension, but as you well know, sometimes one must break the rules in order to serve the greater good.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Mordo won’t see it that way.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>Mordo’s soul is rigid and unmovable, forged by the fires of his youth. He needs your flexibility, just as you need his strength. Only together do you stand a chance of stopping Dormammu.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I’m not ready.
<b>The Ancient One: </b>No one ever is. We don’t get to choose our time. Death is what gives life meaning. To know your days are numbered, your time is short. You’d think after all this time I’d be ready. But look at me: stretching one moment out into a thousand, just so I can watch the snow.
<b>Christine: </b>Are you okay?
I don’t understand what’s happening.
- I know.
But I have to go right now.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>You said that losing my hands didn’t have to be the end, that it could be a beginning.
<b>Christine: </b>Yeah.
Because there are other ways to save lives.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange:</b>A harder way.
<b>Christine: </b>A weirder way.
Dr. Palmer, the ER, please.
Dr. Palmer, the ER.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I don’t want to let you go.
Stop.
Hong Kong
<b>Wong: </b>Choose your weapon wisely. No one steps foot in this Sanctum. No one. Kaecilius.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>You’re on the wrong side of history, Wong.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>She’s dead.
<b>Mordo: </b>You were right. She wasn’t who I thought she was.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>She was complicated.
<b>Mordo: </b>Complicated? The Dark Dimension is volatile, dangerous. What if it overtook her? She taught us it was forbidden, while she drew on its power to steal centuries of life.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>She did what she thought was right.
<b>Mordo: </b>The bill comes due. Don’t you see? Her transgressions led the zealots to Dormammu. Kaecilius was her fault. And here we are, in the consequence of her deception: a world on fire.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Mordo, London Sanctum has fallen, and New York has been attacked. Twice. You know where they’re going next. Hong Kong. You told me once to fight as if my life depended on it, because one day, it might. Well, today is that day. I can not defeat them alone.
<b>Mordo: </b>The Sanctum has already fallen. The Dark Dimension. Dormammu is coming. It’s too late. Nothing can stop him. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Not necessarily.
No.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Spells working. We got a second chance.
No!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Wong! I’m breaking the laws of nature, I know.
<b>Wong: </b>Well, don’t stop now.
When the Sanctum is restored, they will attack again. We have to defend it.
Come on!
Get up, Strange. Get up and fight!
We will finish this.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>You can’t fight the inevitable. Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Beyond time…
Strange!
<b>Kaecilius: </b>He’s gone. Stephen Strange has left to surrender to his power.
[Strange explores the realm.]
[He activates a time spell to prepare himself.]
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu: </b>You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world, like all worlds.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu: </b>You’ve come to die. Your world is now my world...What is this? Illusion? 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No, this is real.
<b>Dormammu: </b>Good.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu: </b>You… what is happening?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Just as you gave Kaecilius powers from your dimension, I’ve brought a little power from mine. This is time: endless looped time.
<b>Dormammu: </b>You dare!
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu: </b>You cannot do this forever.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Actually, I can. This is how things are now: you and me, trapped in this moment, endlessly.
<b>Dormammu: </b>Then you will spend eternity dying.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah. But everyone on Earth will live.
<b>Dormammu: </b>But you will suffer.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Pain is an old friend. Dormammu! I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu</b>: End this!
<b>Dr. Strange</b>: Dormammu!… Dormammu!… Dormammu!… [<i>time loop</i>]
<b>Dormammu: </b>You will never win.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No…But I can lose...again, and again, and again, and again, forever. 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>And that makes you my prisoner.
<b>Dormammu: </b>No...
[He kills Strange for the 1000th time, but as predicted, the loop is still in effect.]
<b>Dormammu: <i>STOP!</i> MAKE THIS <i>STOP!!!!</i></b>
<b>Dormammu: <i>SET ME FREE!</i></b>
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>No. I’ve come to bargain.
<b>Dormammu:</b><i>...what do you want?</i>
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Take your zealots from the Earth, end your assault on my world, never come back: do it, and I’ll break the loop.
Get up, Strange.
Get up and fight!
We will finish this.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>Isn’t it beautiful? A world beyond time. Beyond death. 
[beat]
<b>Kaecilius: </b>What have you done?
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>I made a bargain.
<b>Kaecilius: </b>What is this? 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Well, it’s, uh…it’s everything you ever wanted: eternal life as part of the One. You’re not going to like it. I think he really should have stolen the whole book, because the warnings… the warnings come after the spells.
<i>[Wong suddenly bursts into laughter.]</i>
<b>Wong: </b>Oh, that’s funny.
We did it.
Yes.
Yes, we did it.
By also violating the natural laws.
Look around you. It’s over.
<b>Mordo: </b>You still think there will be no consequences, Strange? No price to pay? We broke our rules, just like her. The bill comes due. Always. A reckoning. I will follow this path no longer.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah, it’s okay.
<b>Wong:</b> Wise choice. You’ll wear the Eye of Agamotto once you’ve mastered its powers. Until then, best not to walk the streets wearing an Infinity Stone.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange:</b> A what?
<b>Wong:</b> You might have a gift for the mystic arts, but you still have much to learn. Word of the Ancient One’s death will spread through the Multiverse. Earth has no Sorcerer Supreme to defend it. We must be ready.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange:</b> We’ll be ready.
<b>Thor</b>: So, Earth has wizards now, huh? 
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Tea?
<b>Thor: </b>I don’t drink tea.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>What do you drink?
<b>Thor: </b>Not tea.
[Strange uses his powers to transform the teacup Thor is holding into a stein of beer]
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>So, I keep a watchlist of individuals and beings from other realms that may be a threat to this world. Your adopted brother, Loki, is one of those beings.
<b>Thor: </b>A worthy inclusion.
<b>Dr. Stephen Strange: </b>Yeah. So, why bring him here to New York?
<b>Thor</b>: That's a long story. A family drama, that kind of thing, but… we’re looking for my father.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Oh, okay. So, if you’ve found Odin, you all will return to Asgard, probably?
<b>Thor</b>: Oh, yes. Probably.
<b>Doctor Strange</b>: Alright. Let me help you.
<i>[Jonathan Pangborn senses someone in his workshop.]</i>
<b>Jonathan</b>: Can I help you?
