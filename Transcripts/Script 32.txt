Alvin, I'm not kidding!<br/>What?
Whoa, whoa!
Dave, look out!
Huh?
Alvin!
Dave!
(ALL GASPING)
Dave!
Dave?
This should<br/>help with the pain.
I wanna talk to my boys.
I just gave you a sedative<br/>that will take effect in<br/>about one minute, so...
Well, let them in quickly.
Dave!<br/>Dave, you're alive!
DAVE: Hey, guys!
It was an accident, I swear.
Are you okay?
I'm really sorry, Dave.
I'll be fine.<br/>I'm just gonna be<br/>
stuck here for a while.
And until I get out,<br/>I've made arrangements
for my Aunt Jackie<br/>to come stay with you.
Who's Aunt Jackie?
The one who sends us<br/>those metal buckets of<br/>yummy popcorn for Christmas.
Oh, Popcorn Jackie.
You don't have much time,<br/>
monsieur Seville.
Uh, listen,<br/>I want you guys to go home<br/>
and live a normal childhood.
(EXHALES)
(GROGGILY) I've even made<br/>arrangements for you<br/>to go to school.
CHIPMUNKS: School?<br/>
Yes, school.
Simon,<br/>I'm putting you in charge.
You are?<br/>(SLEEPILY) I'm<br/>counting on you.
Dave, wait a minute.<br/>Why is he in charge?
Whoa. He's counting on me.
Dave, please don't die.
He's just sleeping.<br/>He's had a sedative.
Oh! A sedative.
Excuse me.<br/>I'm here to escort<br/>the Chipmunks home.
We're not leaving Dave.<br/>I'm putting my paw<br/>down on this one.
You come here!<br/>
Oops. Whoa!
I got it. I'll fix it.<br/>Nope, made it worse.
Please. Please go.<br/>
Oh, this must be it. Uh-oh!
The more stress you put<br/>on monsieur Seville,
the longer it will<br/>take him to recover!
Whoa! Uh-uh!<br/>You are too slow<br/>for me, nurse.
DOCTOR: No! Don't...<br/>
You'll never take me!
I'm not going
anywhere without...

I hope for your<br/>sake he stays asleep<br/>for the entire flight.
Maybe we should<br/>give him another shot,<br/>just to be sure.
(GASPS) Ugh!
(SNIFFING)
Any ideas on how<br/>we find Aunt Jackie?
Got it! Follow me.
Excuse me. Ooh, sorry. Whoo!<br/>
Excuse me. Coming through.
Look! Aunt Jackie!
Oh, yeah! Aunt Jackie!<br/>
ALVIN: Popcorn Jackie!
Oh, hello, dears!<br/>
SIMON: Cool wheelchair.
THEODORE: Yay, we found you!
Popcorn! Where's<br/>
Simon and Theodore's?
Oh, there's plenty<br/>for everyone.<br/>But let's have a hug first.
Oh!<br/>
Get over here,<br/>
you old teddy bear!
I'm not really<br/>much of a hugger.
Oh, boys,<br/>I want you to meet someone.<br/>This is my grandson Toby.
Toby?<br/>
Hi! I'm Theodore.
Toby.<br/>
Huh? What?<br/>What happened? What?
The boys.<br/>
Oh, hey.
Hi!<br/>
Hey! How are you?
I'm Toby.<br/>Nice to meet you.
Toby's living with me
till he figures out<br/>what he wants to<br/>do with his life.
So far, that means going<br/>"pyu, pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"<br/>with his thumbs all day.
Well, for the record,<br/>going "pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu-pyu"<br/>with my thumbs right now
is keeping me in first place.<br/>
So that's important.
Toby, get the bags.<br/>
What bags?
The luggage.<br/>
Get the luggage.
The... Oh, the... Right.
Yeah, let me get those.<br/>
Oh, sorry.
<p style="line-height:0.2;">Toby?<p style="line-height:1.4;">SIMON: Hit the brakes!<br/>Hit the brakes!(EXCLAIMING)<br/>
ALVIN: Abandon wheelchair!
Toby!
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)<br/>I'm fine. Don't worry.
(SHOUTING)
(CRASHING)
(ALL GROANING)
I'm so sorry, Aunt Jackie.
I'm so sorry!
Is she gonna be okay?
Don't worry about me.
I'll be home in no time.
In you go.
I wouldn't be so sure.
What? It was an accident.
I swear.
Been there, done that.
Several times.
I guess you'll be
taking care of us now.
I'll take
"Frightening Thoughts"
for $500, please, Alex.
Not a problem.
I can totally do this.
I took care of my cat,
until he ran away.
Well, "ran away"
is kind of strong wording.
I think he just
wanted his space.
I still see him around
the neighborhood, you know.
He, like,
hisses and claws at me,
but I think that's
just his way of saying
we're still tight. You know.
You guys have
nothing to worry
about, seriously,
'cause I'm not
gonna be like Dave.
You know, Dave's gone.
Gone?
Not gone. Not gone, guys.
He's... He's not dead.
He's very much alive.
He's completely coming back.
I'm just gonna be in his room,
keeping his bed warm.
I'm gonna be doing my thing,
you'll be doing your thing.
You're not even gonna
know I'm there.
Uh, we're supposed
to know you're there.
That's, uh...
That's the whole idea.
Yeah. Yeah! Oh, yeah.
Absolutely. Yeah,
you'll know that I'm there.
I'm just saying,
I'm not gonna be, like,
"I know everything"
and, "You do this,
and you do that,"
like my dad.
All right! Let's do this.
(STARTS ENGINE)
Oh, boy.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
SIMON: Theodore,<br/>we're gonna be just fine.
The important thing is<br/>we're all still alive.
Well, maybe my get well card<br/>
will help Dave<br/>get home faster.
Um... It needs<br/>
just a touch more glitter.
Yep, that should do it.<br/>
Who's hungry?
Ooh! Ooh!<br/>Me, me! Me! Me!<br/>
Let's eat.
(SPEAKS SPANISH)
Simon?
It's a food ghost<br/>
town in here. Alvin?
Holla! The Cheese Balls<br/>are in the hizzouse!
<i>Well, you can tell<br/>by the way I use my walk </i>

Uh... Cheese Ball?
MAN ON PHONE: <i>Dude,<br/>let's go! Come on!</i>
Tom-bo, hey, hey,<br/>give me a second,<br/>real quick.
Alvin, I really, really need<br/>to focus right now
because I am<br/>one knockout away<br/>from a heavyweight title.
Ooh, can we play as well?
Uh... You know,<br/>I don't wanna<br/>hurt your feelings,
but I also don't wanna see<br/>anybody get hurt,
and there are gonna be<br/>fists of fury a-flying.
We can play Monopoly.
We play Monopoly
with Dave all the time.
Do you? That sounds fun,
and we should
do that sometime,
but right now
I gotta get back to
floating like a butterfly
and stinging like a bee.
So...
Hey, Tom-bo,<br/>you still there, buddy?
(GRUNTS) Who needs Toby,<br/>Theodore? You got us!
Yeah, who needs Toby?<br/>Boys, right this way.

Do you know<br/>what Dave would say<br/>if he were here right now?

Dave? As in, "Dave"?
Well, I guess since you<br/>answered the phone,
you haven't burned<br/>down the house yet.
ALVIN: <i>Have a little<br/>faith, Dave.</i>
Yeah. Mayday!
(CLATTERING)
What was that?
(WHISPERING)<br/>Don't stress him out.
Uh, that was<br/>Aunt Jackie. Yeah.
(CHUCKLES) She's making us<br/>a zesty five-course meal.
Really?<br/>Well, can I talk to her?
She's practicing<br/>her pole dancing.
<i>Pole dancing?</i>
What happened<br/>to making dinner?<br/>Guys, what's going on?
Gotta go, Dave.<br/>Alvin, I'm not kidding.
Feel better.<br/>

Toby? Toby, wake up.
(SNORTS) Huh?
Oh, sorry.
Huh? No, that's...
That's okay. What is it?
I had a nightmare.
Oh, the nightmares.
I hate the nightmares.
What was it?
I dreamt we didn't
have a family anymore.
Oh, Theodore. Theodore,
that couldn't happen.
No, you guys are tight.
Nothing could ever
separate you.
Unless, like, an eagle
swooped down from the sky
and was like, caw-caw!
What?
And grabbed you and...
(SPUTTERING)
(SHUDDERING)
Which...
Which couldn't happen, ever.
So why would you...
Why would you ever think that
that would ever happen?
You know,
'cause the Eagles
are in Philadelphia.
THEODORE: No! No!
Sweet dreams.
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)
ALVIN: Toby!<br/>Toby, make it stop!
What are you doing?
There's something<br/>wrong with the clock!
It won't shut up!<br/>I can't sleep!
(YELLING)
(STUTTERING)<br/>That's the point.<br/>It's an alarm clock.
It helps you wake up<br/>early in the morning.
Why would anyone<br/>wanna wake up early?
Well, for school.<br/>
You gotta be there by 8:00.
In the morning?
Look, I don't like<br/>getting up this early<br/>any more than you do.
But we are in<br/>this together, Alvin.
Sooner you get to school,<br/>sooner I get to come home<br/>and get back to sleep.
You mean,
you don't stay
with us at school?
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I've done my time,
thank you very much.
But school is fun, right?
(CHUCKLING) Fun? Well,
I guess maybe it's fun-ish.
Hey, it's my cat!
Hey, remember I was
telling you? Hey!
Hey! Hey, kitty.
It's me. Remember?

around 3:00-ish.

Okay.

We got this. This'll be<br/>a walk in the park.

You must be our new students.<br/>I'm Dr. Rubin, the principal.
And we're the Chipmunks.
Yes, well, that would explain<br/>the fur and the bushy tails.
Follow me, gentlemen.
Gentlemen? Oh, us. Right.
There was a minute left<br/>
and we were down by two.<br/>
And I'm like,
"Coach, I don't care<br/>
if my leg's broken.<br/>
Put me in. I can win this."
I never get tired<br/>of this story.
So I hobble out,<br/>
barely able to stand.
Did I mention my<br/>leg was broken?
Miss Ortega.<br/>
Yes?
Good luck.<br/>
Thanks.
Hello, guys.
Welcome to homeroom.
Good to be here.
I hope.
THEODORE: So this
is a classroom.

Is that the Chipmunks?<br/>The Chipmunks!

Ah...
Somebody's gonna have to
knock those guys down to size.
Well, that should be
pretty easy. I mean,
they're only 8 inches tall.
IAN: I had 15 cars.
I mean,<br/>that's, like, five more cars<br/>
than anybody really needs.
I had seven maids.<br/>I had courtside seats<br/>to the Lakers.
Even my maids had<br/>courtside seats<br/>to the Lakers.
And now look at me.<br/>Look at me!
MAN ON RADIO:<br/><i>Alvin and the Chipmunks!</i><br/>I lost everything.
Except for my dignity.<br/>
They can't take that<br/>away from me.
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING<br/><i>YOU REALLY GOT ME</i><br/>ON RADIO)
And it's all because of them.
(EXCLAIMS)
Oh, hey. Breakfast.
Now I run around<br/>hoping and praying
that I can find other animals<br/>that can sing or dance.<br/>I mean...
(SQUEAKING)
Wait a second.<br/>You don't sing, do you?
Hey! Hey!<br/>That's my muffin!
Give me my muffin,<br/>
you dirty rat!
I will get you, Chipmunks.
BRITTANY: Whoa!
Girls,<br/>
we gotta get out of here.
JEANETTE: I can't see.<br/>
ELEANOR: Ow! Not on my nose!
That's my tail!<br/>
Sorry.
BRITTANY: Move your butt!<br/>
Okay.
Who's squishing me?
(ALL GRUNTING)
We made it.<br/>Jett Records.
Whoo!
Oh, my gosh.<br/>It's him. Ian Hawke.<br/>
Uh, Mr. Hawke?
That voice. I can't<br/>
get it out of my head.
Hello? Mr. Hawke!
That's not in my head.<br/>
That's really happening.
What do you want?<br/>We want to<br/>introduce ourselves.
That's right.<br/>I'm Brittany, and this<br/>is my sister Eleanor.
Hello, sir.<br/>Such a pleasure<br/>
to meet you.
And I'm their<br/>sister Jeanette.
Although I feel
more like an Olivia,
or sometimes a...
Anyway,
we're the Chipettes.
And, well,
we would just be so honored
to have you represent us.
You made Alvin and
the Chipmunks stars.
We wanna be stars, too.
Yeah.
And hang out
with the Chipmunks.
Okay, now, listen,
before we get all girlie
and giggly about this,
just tell me one thing.
You can sing, right?
(ALL WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY)
No, no, wait. Hang on.
Not here. Um...
Why don't we take
this meeting upstairs
in my penthouse office?
ELEANOR: Sure!
This is so exciting.
We're really on our way now.
Oh, my gosh.
Guys, can you believe it?
My first penthouse office!
JEANETTE: Wow!<br/>ELEANOR: Oh, boy!
Oh, my.
The Hollywood sign.
Thought you might
like the view.
So, ladies,
tell me a little something
about yourselves.
Well, we grew up
in a small town,
population 300, and--
Yeah? Really?
That's fascinating. Great.
All right, impress me.
(CHIPETTES WHISPERING)
BRITTANY: One, two, three.
(SINGING <i>PUT YOUR RECORD ON)</i>
Girls, girls, girls, girls.
Guess who just became
the number one Chipette fan
in the whole dang world?
Ian Hawke, that's who.
ELEANOR: Yay! Nice!<br/>BRITTANY: Oh, my gosh.<br/>Oh, my gosh!
So when can we
meet the Chipmunks?
That's an excellent question.
And the excellent answer is,
I don't really
represent Alvin and
the Chipmunks anymore.
Oh, no!
What happened?
Oh, classic tale.
Sweet and innocent
when I met them,
and they had nothing.
And then I work my butt off
to make them rock stars,
and they changed.
Turned on me
like bad cheese.
No!
Oh, that's terrible.
I know! I mean,
I treated Alvin like he
was my own son, you know?
And then he just
goes and spits on me.
Literally. He filled his
chipmunk cheeks with saliva
and just had at it.
And don't even get me
started about Simon.
(GASPS)
But not Theodore, right?
It's the cuddly ones
you have to watch out for.
Oh.
But what are we
talkin' about them for?
Come on! They're over.
Tired. Novelty act.
Chipmunks who can sing.
But girl chipmunks
who can sing?
Fasten your seatbelts!
Yippee!<br/>
Yay!
So, I'm on Jay-Z's yacht,<br/>right? And I say,<br/>"Jay, where's Beyonce?"
And he says, "She's holding<br/>a plate full of Cheese Balls.<br/>Turn around."
And guess what?<br/>She was!
(ALL LAUGHING)
P.S., Dave left me in charge.
Staying up till 10:00<br/>

Hey, girls,<br/>
look what I can do.

You are Theodore-able.
THEODORE: Thank you.<br/>
You're so cute.

Gentlemen.
You threatened to<br/>climb inside of him<br/>and build a nest.
That was out of line.
I'm not even sure<br/>
that's physically possible.
I should suspend<br/>all three of you.
Please do.
(BOBBLEHEAD SQUEAKING)
Instead,<br/>I have a better idea.
Due to budget cutbacks,
we are in jeopardy of losing<br/>our beloved music program.
That's awful.<br/>
RUBIN: I know.
But there is one<br/>
small ray of hope.
Every year
the district sponsors
a music competition.
And the winner's
school receives $25,000.
If we win,<br/>
we can save our program.
And you want us to perform?
'Cause I didn't
think you were a fan.
Why don't you sleep on it?
Wait a minute!
What is that? That's us!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait.
THEODORE: I look skinny.
Promise me that you
won't say anything.
A principal has
a certain image to uphold,
and if the faculty
ever found out about this,
I could...
I just cannot believe
that you're actually
sitting in my office.
I have all of your CDs.
I even went to see
you last year in Denver.
That's where I got this.
It was my birthday.
And I was like,
"Oh! The Chipmunks! Ah!"
So what do you say?
Will you represent
our school?
Honestly, suspension still
sounds pretty good to me.
Come on, Alvin.
What do you say?
One for all and
three for one!
Well put, Theodore.
Very well put.
Count us in.<br/>(UNENTHUSIASTICALLY) Yay.
Go, Eagles!
(SCREECHES)
Eagles? Where?
IAN : Ah, the penthouse level.
Tres exclusivo.
(DOG WHIMPERING)
Isn't that that Chihuahua?
You know, from the movie?
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it...
I mean, yeah,
of course it is.
A lot of big names live here.
ELEANOR : Hola! Como esta?
BRITTANY : I must have his autograph.
IAN : Hey, hey, Brittany, uh-uh.
You wanna be a star?
Act like a star.
All right?
You don't get autographs,
you give them.
Oh. Right.
Uh... Hey, look, over there!
There're a couple of
the Jonas Brothers.
(GASPS) Where?
I don't see them.
IAN : Here we are! Okay!
Let's scoot in to my...
What? Did I... Oh, darn it!
Darn it to heck!
ELEANOR : What's wrong?
IAN : Girls, I apologize,
but I seem to
have left my keys
back in my office.
What if one of you
were to shoot through
that mail slot
and open it up
from the inside, huh?
ELEANOR : Oh, I'll do it.
(GRUNTING)
I'm stuck!
IAN : All right, I got you.
I got you.
(IAN GRUNTING)
ELEANOR : Ow! Not so hard!
IAN : Might want to lay off the nuts.
ELEANOR : Oh.
IAN : All right, how about you, Glasses? You're in
better shape. Wanna go?
I'm not that great
at things like this.
I got it!
(DOOR UNLOCKING)
Yes!
Ooh! Impressive!
BRITTANY : Nice!
Gee willikers! Stripes!
Oh, snazzy!
Circles! This is the best
tree house ever!
A red piano!
Oh, Brit.
Is this a dream?
Somebody pinch me.
This is way better
than a tree.
I just adore
a penthouse view.
Nice one, Hawke.
Yeah? You like it?
BRITTANY : Do I?
I live here.
It's so beautiful!
Yeah.
NARRATOR ON TV : Last time
We visited Meerkat Manor,
a rival group
called the Commandos
was making large inroads
into the Whiskers' territory.

Ah, Toby!
I thought Alvin was messy.
This is literally disgusting.
I feel like I'm living in a dumpster.
Simon, it's Meerkat Manor.
Watch with me.
(SIGHS) You know, you're right.
You're right. I just need to relax.
Maybe that'll ease
my nerves a little.
(CRUNCHING)
What is this? What...
Oh, you've got to be joking.
A taco? In a blanket? Toby!
TOBY: Ladies and gentlemen,<br/>going for his turkey,<br/>it's the Tobester.
(GRUNTS)
Come on, baby!
(LAUGHING) Yes!
Yes!
(EXCLAIMS)
No problem.<br/>
Watch and learn, my friends.
Oops. Well, it looks like it's time to
play my second favorite game.
Hide the Broken TV from Dave.
You wanna play?
No!
Go easy on him, taco boy.
This day's been
bad enough already.
Oh! I think I see
what's going on.
You guys have been having
some problems at school?
Uh, no. Not really.
Unless you consider
getting your head dumped into a
public toilet a problem.
(LAUGHING) Ouch!
Swirlies are the worst.
At least that's
what I've heard.
Because there's no way that I could
possibly know that on a personal level.
Toby, what was school
like for you?
Toby? Toby?
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
(GASPING)
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
Ow! Ow!
(EXCLAIMING)
(SCREAMS)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
(GASPS)
THEODORE: Toby? Toby!<br/>What?
What was school like for me?
Uh, in a word, awesome.
But, you know, that's 'cause I was,
like, extremely popular.
Is that why you still live
with your grandma?
And refer to yourself
as "the Tobester"?
And go "pyu-pyu-pyu" all day?
(CHUCKLING SARCASTICALLY)
Bedtime!
(ALARM CLOCK BUZZING)
(SLEEPILY) Alvin?
Alvin, wake up and<br/>
turn off the alarm!
Alvin!
Alvin, I'm not kidding! I'm not kidding,<br/>
buddy. Turn it off!
Guys! Guys...
(BUZZING CONTINUES)
Boys, this isn't funny.
ALVIN: (MUFFLED)
Hello. Humane Society?
Yes. I need help.
A man is after us.
He wants to take us
to a terrible place.
School!
TOBY : Out!
Aw, have a heart, huh?
Have a heart?
Dave wants you
to go to school,
so you're going.
Yeah, well, don't worry about
picking us up at 3:00, Toby.
We'll get a ride.
In a hearse!
(CHUCKLING)
Guys, guys, come on.
Look, trust me.
The second day is never
as bad as the first.
(CHIPMUNKS EXCLAIMING)
Glasses! Glasses!
You wouldn't hit a guy
with glasses, would you?
BOY 1 : You're out, man!
BOY 2 : Ha!
Right in the pancreas.
(PANTING)
(BOTH EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)
Call the nurse.
COACH : Out! Out! You're out.
SIMON: Come on, Alvin!
Remember your five D's!
Dodge, duck, dip,
dive and dodge!
COACH : Move!
You're next, fur ball.
You talking to me?
You talking to me?
I'm the only one here,
so you must be talking to me.
(BOYS LAUGHING)
(LAUGHING) Yeah! Got him!
BOY : Did you see that?
Oh! Boo-yah!
Unbelievable.
He caught it.
You're out, man.
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
And the fat lady,
she's a-singing.
Dude's got hands.
I think they're paws,
actually.
Whatever.
We can definitely
use him on the team.
Hey, fur ball!
How would you like
a spot on the football team?
Football?
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
I gotta say, you're good.
I'm gonna let you hang out
with us at lunch.
That is, if you wanna
be on the team.
Hmm. Interesting proposition.
SIMON : Alvin?
Let me get back
to you on that.
This is a one-time offer.
Don't take too long
to think it over.
Right! Like I would ditch
my brothers just to become
the first chipmunk ever
to play on an actual
varsity football team.
(LAUGHING) Fat chance!
ALVIN: The stadium
is pandemonium!
It's fourth and goal.
It's up! It's up!
And he catches it!
The crowd goes crazy!
(IMITATING CROWD ROARING)
RYAN : Psst! Hey!
Me?
ALVIN: Alvin! Alvin!
Alvin! Alvin!
Alvin, I think the
super-cool jock table
is paging you.
Why would I go over there?
Like I really need to worry
about being popular.
Hello? Talking chipmunk? Huh?
World-famous rock star?
Guy with his own plush doll?
Guys, I'm on pajamas!
Not to toot my
own horn, but...
(IMITATING HORN TOOTING)
Come on. It's laughable.
Just go, Alvin.
Really? You mean it?
Yeah.
Thanks! I'll be right back!
What up, dudes?
RYAN : What's up, little man?
XANDER : Welcome
to the cool table.
Yeah! Bring it.
BOY : Yeah!
Pound the paw.
(ALVIN GRUNTING)
I want it!
I got it! I got it! I...
Don't got it.
I think he's cute.
Me, too.
Toss. And he's up!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Thank you.
Hey, Alvin.
Call me.
Bernie, I'm telling you,
the Chipmunks are old news.
I got the next big thing.
Singing female chipmunks.
(PHONE LINE DISCONNECTS)
Hello? Bernie? Hello?
God! What part of "singing
female chipmunks"
don't these people...
Girls, we're going to school.
ALVIN : And he's up
and he scores!
Hey! What up, S?
Whoa! Don't hate
on the high-five.
(SARCASTICALLY)
Yeah. High-five.
Look, Alvin,
I know you guys have been busy
with your sporting endeavors
and whatnot,
but I can really use
your help at home.
Oh, no can do.
Ry-dawg is gonna teach me
how to get pretty girls
to do my homework.
(STAMMERING) Alvin,
you promised Theodore
we'd hang out.
We are watching
Meerkat Manor tonight.
No pretty girls.
Dude, I can't
swing it today, bro.
That's what you
say every day, Alvin.
Need I remind you
it's your day to
do the laundry?
You better listen to
your daddy, Alvin. You don't
wanna get grounded. Oh!
Are you going
to pick that up?
Are you going to make me?
(SPEAKS FRENCH)
I'm just going to
elegantly show you
how it's done.
Uh, Simon...
Off the glass.
And you call yourself a jock.
(LAUGHING MOCKINGLY)
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
My brother,
he's a real jokester.
Always kidding.
Uh, anyhoo, um,
see you guys in class.
Hey, that's my pudding.
It's my pudding.
(LAUGHING)
Why are you
trying to embarrass me
in front of my friends?
Are you kidding me?
They're the ones you
should be embarrassed by.
Good luck with
the show, guys.
Front row seats.
Can't wait.
So? What song are
we gonna sing?
No pressure,
but the whole school
is counting on us.
Oh, relax. It's like Ryan says,<br/>who's gonna beat<br/>singing chipmunks?
<i>(I WANT TO KNOW<br/>WHAT LOVE IS</i> PLAYING)
(ALL SIGHING)
(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)
Oh, that Simon is dreamy!
I think Theodore
was looking at me.
Yeah, I know. But, guys,
remember what Ian said?
We can't trust them.
Whoa!
Wow!
(SIMON GROWLING)
(PLAYING <i>FOLLOW ME NOW)</i>
(CHIPMUNKS SINGING)
Wow.
What happened?
I never thought I'd say this,<br/>
but pink is my<br/>new favorite color.
Her glasses were<br/>quite fetching.
She's like a beautiful<br/>
green gumdrop.
Okay, well,<br/>if you guys wanna do this,<br/>
you have to pay attention.
Maybe this is a good time<br/>for us to take a break.
Good call. Take five.
She's right.<br/>We need to focus, fellas.<br/>Right.
This is for my screensaver.
Cheese Balls!
Hey, you guys! Hey.
You guys ready to go?
'Cause I got a lot
of important stuff
to do at home.
Oh, you must be
their guardian.
That I...
That I am. Yes, I am.
Hi, how are you?
How are you, Dr. Rubin?
I know that because
I went to school
here a few years ago.
I don't know if
you remember me.
Toby Seville? Probably not.
Mmm. Uh...
Toby?
(STUTTERING)
No way! Hi!
Hey, no braces.
(GASPING)
Your teeth look great.
(STAMMERING) You... I...
Thank you. I appreciate...
I did. I did.
I did get my braces off
'cause they were just...
(EXCLAIMING)
Oh! Okay. Oh...
(CYMBALS CLATTERING)
(IMITATING HORN TOOTING)
That... You know what,
I know a guy who actually...
Who works on drum heads.
So that's very good.
I'll be in the car, guys.
So...
Somebody's in love.
That aside,
we're going to replace
everything. Chipmunk's honor.
Ah, yes,
the old false-modesty
suck-up routine.
Ian Hawke?
I thought I smelled a rat.
May I help you, Mr. Hawke?
Well, I was wondering
if I could help you.
I just heard about
your musical competition,
and I just skedaddled down
here as quick as I could
to volunteer my girls.
Oh. Well, that's very
thoughtful of you,
but I've already
made up my mind.
Well, perhaps this will
change your mind. Girls?
(ALL GASPING)
They're with Ian?
Curtains!

(STUDENTS CHEERING)
My good people<br/>of West Eastman,
you have just witnessed<br/>the debut of the Chipettes.
Thank you.<br/>
Thank you. Thank you.
So?
They were splendid,
but as I said before,
I have made my decision.
Brit?
No!
I see.
You've made your decision.
I don't mean
to speak out of school,
Doctor,
but in the true
spirit of democracy,
which our great,
wonderful country
was founded upon,
I say let the people vote.
Let them choose!
One person, one vote.
I say, let us vote!
STUDENTS: Let us vote!<br/>
Let us vote!
Let us vote!<br/>Let us vote!
Please,<br/>don't be a fascist granny.<br/>Let freedom ring, Doctor.
STUDENTS: Let us vote!
Let us vote!
You make a persuasive case,
Mr. Hawke.
All right, here's what
I'm going to do.
This Friday, each group
will perform one song
in front of the student body.
Yes!
All right!
Whoever gets
the most applause
will represent the school.
What?
Thank you!
Yes!
We did it!
In your face!
Oh, it is on
like Donkey Kong.

Ooh! Oh! Excuse me.<br/>Oh! Um...
(LAUGHING) Yeah, well,
(STAMMERING)<br/>I just wanted to<br/>warn you about Ian.
What? You should<br/>be grateful to Ian.
He did<br/>everything for you, Alvin,<br/>and you broke his heart.
Hmm. Really?<br/>How do I put this gently?
He's the devil.<br/>
He doesn't have a heart.
Oh, and one of<br/>
the things he did for us<br/>
was put us in a cage.
Alvin,<br/>he would never do that.
Yeah, 'cause you<br/>were there. I forgot.
Brittany,<br/>you'd better watch out.<br/>
I don't need advice from you.
But...<br/>
But nothing, Alvin.

something here.
Brittany.
Here, come up here.

No, you two stay back.

JEREMY : I don't mean
to interrupt your game,

stand up to Ryan

That took guts.
Really?
And that's the type of guy
that we're looking for.
Jeremy Smith,
student body president.
How do you do? I'm...
International recording star
and litter monitor
Simon Seville.
Litter monitor?
Litter monitor.
It's a new position
that we've created
to help raise awareness
of a pressing problem
in our society.
I agree 99% plus 1.
You do the math.
Well, Simon, I know
this is a lot to ask,
but we're looking
for a take-charge guy
to take charge
of this very
rewarding position.
What do you say?
SIMON : Excuse me, everybody.
Quick announcement.
I'm Simon.
I'm the litter monitor.
Put your trash in
the garbage can.
Peace out.
(ALL LAUGHING)
Hello, ladies!
You probably weren't aware
that you dropped a wrapper
on the ground,
so we're just
gonna call this one
a warning.
Carry on.
What up, dudes?
What up, Al?
Hey, everybody!
Check it out!
The newest member
of the football team.
Suiting up for
our first away game.
Ry, don't mess with me.
I talked to coach.
You're in.
Dude! That's great!
Awesome!
So check it out, A-man.
We're watching
the new litter monitor.
I wasn't aware
the school even
had a litter monitor.
We don't.
But don't tell him that.
Are you going
to pick that up?
No.
Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.
I guess I'm going
to have to give you
a citation.
Oh, no! I got a citation
for littering!
Oh, no!
You wanna play
that game, do you?
Well, guess what?
I can play that
game all day long.
Simon!
It's a joke, dude.
Litter is no joking matter.
No. You're the joke.
We're messing with you.
There's no such thing
as a litter monitor.
What?
Good one, huh?
(CHUCKLES)
You knew about this, Alvin?
Does the word "brother"
mean anything to you?
(STAMMERING)
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, well, he has some
new brothers now that he's
on the football team.
(TEETH CLENCHED)
You still haven't
picked up that litter.

them off the stage.
The group that we

So, without further ado,
I give you the Chipettes!
This is it, girls.
Can you believe it?

THEODORE : Did you find him?
Guys. Sorry, I searched
the whole perimeter.
And I don't know why,
but the team's not back yet.
Well, what should we do?
I would...
I would ask someone
who's not me.
(SIGHS)
I know what<br/>we should do.
AUDIENCE: (CHANTING)<br/>Chipmunks! Chipmunks!
Chipmunks!<br/>Chipmunks!<br/>Chipmunks!
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)
(AUDIENCE MURMURING)
Hi, everyone.
(CLEARING THROAT)
Our brother Alvin<br/>couldn't be here today.
The thing is,<br/>we've never performed<br/>
without Alvin.
And we're not<br/>starting now.
(STUDENTS CHATTERING)
You can't have<br/>only two little pigs.
You can't have<br/>only two musketeers.
So, you know<br/>you can't have<br/>only two Chipmunks.
Thank you.
(STUDENTS MURMURING)
(STUDENTS BOOING)
I'll take you home.
(BOOING CONTINUES)
Hear that, girls?<br/>That is the sound<br/>of success.
I realize<br/>How devastated you<br/>Chipmunk fans must be.
So, I guess that means<br/>that the Chipettes
will be representing<br/>West Eastman...<br/>
Come on, girls.
Let's take a victory lap.
Hey, come on, guys.<br/>
Let's go.
Brit, we have to.
Let's go.
Yeah! Let them know!
Thank you. Thanks.
Ah, life is good.
Especially when<br/>
you're not a loser.
Hey, guys! I'm here!
Guys?
Oh, great.
They're gone, Alvin.
They're never<br/>gonna forgive me.
You know, Alvin,<br/>Ian was right.
You don't care about<br/>anyone but yourself.
(GULPS)
Oh, and by the way,
I never wanted
to win this way.
(LIGHTS TURNS OFF)
(SIGHING)
Simon? Theodore?
Simon, are you awake?
Theo?
(WHISPERING) Theo!
(SIGHS)
Theodore? Theodore?
Theodore, I don't blame you
for being mad... Uh-oh.
"I ran away from home.
"Don't look for
me at the zoo,
'cause I'm not there."
Oh, no, Theodore.
Hello? Meerkat family?
(GRUNTING)
Oh, brother.
(GRUNTING)
Is anyone home?
My name is Theodore.
I'd like to be
in your family.
Maybe they're hiding.
Don't be afraid!
(EAGLE SCREECHING)
(GASPS)
(STAMMERING)
You are not a meerkat.
Toby, you take the lions,
the tigers and the bears.
Simon and I will
take the butterfly room.
(EAGLE SQUAWKING)
THEODORE : (STAMMERING)
Nice eagle.
SIMON : Theo!
Don't move, Theodore!
No problem there.
Hang in there!
Hang in there, little guy!
We're gonna get
you out of there!
Okay, okay,
we need a plan.
We need a carefully
executed plan.
Or you could
just run in there
like a maniac.
(SCREECHING)
ALVIN : Theo, watch out!
Hi, I'm Theodore.
(GRUNTS)
Hey, birdie!
Over here!
Are you hungry?
'Cause this "A"
stands for "appetizer"!
(SCREECHING)
Let's all just relax
and we'll talk this out.
Okay?
Look, I get why you
want Theodore. I do.
But, I'm sorry,
I can't let that happen.
He's my brother.
Not that he'd know that,
because I've been
such a big jerk lately.
If anyone deserves
to be eaten, it's me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Not literally!
I got you, Alvin!
Move it!
Oh, Theo.
Help!
Guys,
it's a wedge-tail eagle.
Their only mortal enemy
is the pygmy elephant.
Luckily,
I speak a little pachyderm.
(TRUMPETING)
(CHIRPING)
I think it's working!
(TRUMPETING)
Or not!
(ALL EXCLAIMING)
Guys, that was huge.
He's right.
So, are we back
to one for all
and three for one?
Come on, Simon.
Hug it out.
You know I'm sorry, Si.
Si? Don't make me
have to kiss you!
Because I'll do it.
I don't care.
(SMOOCHING)
Here come the lips.<br/>Make-out train is<br/>leaving the station.
(TOOTING)
(CHUCKLING)
Think I'll take<br/>
that hug.
(SIGHS) Guys.
(SINGING <i>SINGLE LADIES)</i>
Interested?<br/>Call Ian Hawke.<br/>310-555-5309.
Deloris, get me that
Ian Hawke on the phone.
(CHIPETTES HUMMING<br/><i>SINGLE LADIES)</i>
There you are...<br/>
Hi.
...my sweet<br/>little moneymakers.
Do you remember<br/>when I told you
that I would make<br/>
you all big stars?
Yeah.<br/>
Well,
guess who's opening up<br/>for Britney Spears
at the Staples Center<br/>tonight?
(SQUEALING) Yeah!
Pinch me.<br/>Am I dreaming?<br/>Oh, my gosh.
Wait, tonight?<br/>We'll miss<br/>the school contest.
That is correct.<br/>You will miss<br/>the school contest.
You're so smart.<br/>I can never get<br/>anything past you.
It was never about<br/>that stupid school contest.
It was always about<br/>making Brittany a star.
Oh.
That's what you wanted,<br/>right?
(GASPS)
(HESITANTLY) Well, yeah.
Well, tonight's<br/>your big chance.
It's all about you,<br/>Brittany.
What about<br/>Jeanette and Eleanor?
Yeah, well,<br/>they can sing backup.<br/>I got them some stuff, too.
Oh!<br/>
Hey!
But we're her sisters.
And the three of us<br/>sing together<br/>or not at all.
Okay, fine.<br/>All I really need<br/>is the B-girl.
Ian, I won't do it<br/>without them.
Okay. Fine, fine.<br/>Let's move on to plan B.
Okay! Who likes barbecue?
Barbecue?
Because I know
this awesome little
barbecue restaurant
in the Valley
that makes
the best roasted chipmunk.
(INHALES) Mmm, real tasty.
Unless, of course,
you wanna sing.
Oh!
(BRITTANY SIGHS)
Welcome to West Eastman,
and thank you
for supporting music
in our schools.
Now, remember,
the group you pick tonight
will win $25,000
for their school!
Now, we've got a lot of acts,
and we Have to turn
the Heat off at 9:30,
so without any further ado,
representing Orange Grove,
put your Hands together
for Li'l Rosero!
<i>(ALL NIGHT DANCE CREW</i><br/>PLAYING ON STEREO)

What? You want
a piece of this, eagle?
(CHUCKLES)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Ian Hawke?
I'll take that.
Oh, I didn't realize<br/>I pocket-dialed<br/>1-800-LOWLIFE.
BRITTANY: (SOFTLY) Alvin?<br/>
Brittany?
Yeah, could you guys<br/>fill in for us?
We're not gonna be able<br/>to perform tonight.
What about<br/>
the music department?
The whole school<br/>
is counting on you.
I know. I know.<br/>I should have listened<br/>
to you about Ian.
Don't tell me!
Yep. He locked us<br/>
in a cage.
What? This is the
biggest you have?
I had my assistant call<br/>
and ask for the biggest limo.
This is not
the biggest limo you have.
I'll go break
the news to Dr. Rubin.
Brittany?
Alvin, don't move!
You got it!
Brittany,
I'm coming to get you.
Simon, tell Jeanette
how to pick the lock.
Roger that!
Oh, man. I need to
get to the girls, fast!
Oh! I know how!
(WHOOPING)
<i>(ALL NIGHT DANCE CREW</i><br/>

Jeanette, focus.
The third number
is notoriously the

I'm assuming
it's a prime number,
but we can't assume...
Simon! The first
two numbers were ones.
I got to go with one.
(GASPS) It opened!<br/>
IAN: All right, girls.
Ian's coming.<br/>
Put the phone
back. Hurry!
Get ready to be fabulous.
Oh, we're ready.

Don't mind if I do.
You know why<br/>I don't mind if I do?
Because tonight,<br/>we've got to toast<br/>to a very special someone
named me.
They said<br/>I couldn't do it.
They said I'd never<br/>bounce back.
Guess what?<br/>Time to kiss<br/>

Oh, yeah.
A toast to the ladies

In the words of the Donald,<br/>
"You're fired!"
Alvin!
(CONTINUES SINGING <i>NO ONE)</i>
Hey! Hey. Hey, guys.
Any sign of Alvin yet? Huh?
No. No Alvin,
and no Chipettes.
Just Dr. Rubin and,
you know, the entire
school counting on us.
(STAMMERING) Well...
Yeah, you know, don't worry.
Everything will work out-ish.
(CONTINUES SINGING)
BRITTANY: Faster, Alvin!<br/>ALVIN: Don't worry.
I'm gonna get a little help
from my friend Digger!
Roger that, Alvin!
Look out!
Whoa! Feels like I'm back
at the race track.
MAN: Hey! Careful!
IAN: Keep going!
What are you doing?
Yeah.
Wait till I tell
everybody back home
I saved Alvin Seville.
I guess I owe you
an apology about Ian.
Stick with me, Brit.
I'll never steer you wrong.
(BRITTANY EXCLAIMING)
BRITTANY: Oh, yeah.
I'll never doubt you again.

I gotta say,
he is definitely persistent.
We have got to lose him.
Hang on!

I've got a plan.
Jump on the count

Oh! That's it.

BRITTANY: Just<br/>
hang on tight, Jeanette.
Bring my girls right to me.
We need the remote.
Guys, I know what to do.
It's hats off to Ian.
Whoa!
ALVIN: The remote!
ELEANOR: I can't reach it!
I'm going for it.<br/>
Grab my ankles.

I got it!

Oops!

My bad!
Adios, Ian!
And now for our<br/>final act of the night.
Now, listen, we've had<br/>
a last-second change<br/>to the line-up,
but we don't think<br/>you're gonna be<br/>too disappointed.
Representing West Eastman,<br/>
it's the Chipmunks!
We may have to<br/>
go out there, Theodore.
