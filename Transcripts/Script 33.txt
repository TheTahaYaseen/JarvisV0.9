<br/>
I need a father who's a roIe modeI,
not some horny geek boy...
<br/>
who's going to spray his shorts whenever
I bring a girIfriend home from schooI.
<br/>
What a Iame-o.
<br/>
Someone really shouId just put him
out of his misery.
<br/>
[ Boy ]
You want me to kill him for you ?

[ Man Narrating ]
My name is Lester Burnham.
<br/>
This is my neighborhood.
<br/>
This is my street.
<br/>
This is my Iife.
<br/>
I'm    years oId.
In Iess than a year, I'll be dead.
<br/>
[ AIarm Ringing ]
<br/>
Of course,
I don't know that yet.
<br/>
And in a way,
I'm dead aIready.
<br/>
Look at me:
jerking off in the shower.
<br/>
This will be the high point of my day.
It's all downhill from here.
<br/>
That's my wife, CaroIyn.
<br/>
See the way the handIe on those pruning
shears matches her gardening cIogs ?
<br/>
- That's not an accident.
- [ Dog Barking ]
<br/>
[ Man ]
Hush, Bitsy !
<br/>
- Hush. What is wrong with you ?
- That's our next-door neighbor, Jim.
<br/>
- And that's his Iover, Jim.
- [ Both Arguing ]
<br/>
- You spoiI her.
Bitsy, no bark. Come inside now.
- Me ?
<br/>
- Come on. Yes. Inside.
- [ CaroIyn ] Good morning, Jim !
<br/>
Good morning, CaroIyn.
<br/>
I Iove your tie !
That coIor !
<br/>
I just Iove your roses. How do you
get them to fIourish Iike this ?
<br/>
Well, I'll tell you:
eggshells and MiracIe-Gro.
<br/>
-I've never heard that.
-Man, I get exhausted just watching her.
<br/>
She wasn't aIways Iike this.
She used to be happy.
<br/>
We used to be happy.
<br/>
My daughter Jane.
OnIy chiId.
<br/>
- Janie's a pretty typicaI teenager:
- [ Computer Beeps ]
<br/>
angry, insecure, confused.
<br/>
I wish I couId tell her that's all going
to pass, but I don't want to Iie to her.
<br/>
[ Horn Honking ]
<br/>
Jane, honey, are you trying
to Iook unattractive ?
<br/>
- Yes.
- CongratuIations.
You've succeeded admirabIy.
<br/>
Lester, couId you make me
a IittIe Iater, pIease,
because I'm not quite Iate enough.
<br/>
[ Mutters, Indistinct ]
<br/>
Nice going, Dad.
<br/>
[ Lester Narrating ] Both my wife and
daughter think I'm this gigantic Ioser.
<br/>
And they're right.
<br/>
I have Iost something.
<br/>
I'm not exactIy sure
what it is,
<br/>
but I know
I didn't aIways feeI this...
<br/>
sedated.
<br/>
But you know what ?
<br/>
It's never too Iate
to get it back.
<br/>
Hello. This is Lester Burnham
from Media MonthIy magazine.
<br/>
I'm calling
for Mr. TambIin, pIease.
<br/>
Well, we're all under
a deadIine here. You see,
there's some basic information...
<br/>
about your product Iaunch
that isn't even covered
in your press reIease, and I'd--
<br/>
Yeah, c--
can I ask you a question ?
<br/>
Who is TambIin ? Does he exist ?
'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in.
<br/>
Yeah. Okay.
I'll Ieave my number.
<br/>
It's    -    .
<br/>
Lester Burnham.
Thank you !
<br/>
Hey, Les.
You got a minute ?
<br/>
For you, Brad,
I got five !
<br/>
So, yeah, I'm sure you can understand
our need to cut corners around here.
<br/>
Oh, sure.
Times are tight.
<br/>
You got to free up some cash.
You got to spend money to make money.
<br/>
- Right ?
- ExactIy.
<br/>
Like the time that Mr. FIournoy
used the company MasterCard
to pay for that hooker,
<br/>
and she used the card numbers
and stayed at the St. Regis for,
what was it, three months ?
<br/>
- That's unsubstantiated gossip.
- That's $     .
That's somebody's saIary.
<br/>
That's somebody who's going
to get fired because Craig
has to pay women to fuck him !
<br/>
Jesus !
<br/>
I mean, caIm down.
Nobody's getting fired yet.
<br/>
- [ Scoffs ]
- That's why we're having everyone...
<br/>
write out a job description mapping
out in detaiI how they contribute.
<br/>
That way management
can assess who's vaIuabIe--
<br/>
And who's expendabIe.
<br/>
It's just business.
<br/>
I've been writing
for this magazine for    years.
<br/>
- You've been here how Iong ?
A whoIe month ?
- I'm one of the good guys, Les.
<br/>
I'm trying to IeveI with you.
<br/>
This is your one chance
to save your job.
<br/>
[ CaroIyn ] There is no decision.
You just write the damn thing.
<br/>
- [ Lester ] You don't think
it's weird and kind of fascist ?
- PossibIy.
<br/>
- But you don't want to be unempIoyed.
- All right.
<br/>
Let's just all sell our souIs
and work for Satan 'cause
it's more convenient that way.
<br/>
Oh, couId you be a IittIe bit
more dramatic, pIease, huh ?
<br/>
So, we finally
got new neighbors.
<br/>
You know, if the Lomans
had Iet me represent them
instead of the ReaI Estate King,
<br/>
that house wouId never
have sat on the market for six months.
<br/>
Well, they were still mad at you
for cutting down their sycamore.
<br/>
Their sycamore ?
Come on.
<br/>
A substantiaI portion of the root
structure was on our property.
<br/>
You know that.
How can you call it their sycamore ?
<br/>
I wouIdn't have the heart to just cut
down something if it wasn't partially
mine, which, of course, it was.
<br/>
<br/>
[ Woman Singing ]
<br/>
<br/>
-    [ Continues, Indistinct ]
- Mom, do we aIways have to Iisten
to this eIevator music ?
<br/>
No. No, we don't.
<br/>
And as soon you've prepared a nutritious
yet savory meaI that I'm about to eat,
<br/>
you can Iisten
to whatever you Iike.
<br/>
So, Janie, how was schooI ?
<br/>
It was okay.
<br/>
Just okay ?
<br/>
No, Dad.
It was spectacuIar.
<br/>
Well, you want to know
how things went in my job today ?
<br/>
They've hired
this efficiency expert,
<br/>
this really friendIy guy
named Brad--
<br/>
How perfect is that ?
And he's basically there
to make it seem they're justified...
<br/>
in firing somebody,
because they couIdn't just come
out and say that, couId they ?
<br/>
No, no. That wouId just be too honest.
So they've asked us--
<br/>
[ ChuckIing ] You couIdn't
possibIy care Iess, couId you ?
<br/>
What do you expect ?
<br/>
You can't all of a sudden be my best
friend just because you had a bad day.
<br/>
I mean, hello, you've bareIy even
spoken to me for months.
<br/>
Oh, what ?
You're <i>Mother of the Year</i> ?
<br/>
- [ Muttering ]
You treat her Iike an empIoyee.
- What ?
<br/>
[ Shouts ]
What ?
<br/>
I'm going
to get some ice cream.
<br/>
Janie...
<br/>
I'm sorry I haven't
been more avaiIabIe.
<br/>
I'm just-- I--
<br/>
You know, you don't aIways
have to wait for me to come to you.
<br/>
Oh, great.
So now it's my fauIt ?
<br/>
I didn't say that.
It's nobody's fauIt. It--

for any cook.

with positive energy, huh ?

how much a ceiIing fan can
cut down on your energy costs.

There's nothing Iagoon-Iike about it.

Except for maybe the bugs.
There aren't even any pIants out here.

What do you call this ?
Is this not a pIant ?

can aIways call my Iandscape architect.

What makes you sure she wants us

Of course not. She doesn't want us

But she's been practicing
for weeks.

I'll bet she's going to
resent it, and I'm missing

Excuse me ?
<br/>
I quit, so you don't have
to pay me. Now Ieave me aIone.
<br/>
AsshoIe.
<br/>
I think you just
became my personaI hero.
<br/>
Doesn't that make you nervous,
just quitting your job Iike that ?
<br/>
Well, I guess when
you're all of, what,   --
<br/>
Eighteen. I just do
these gigs as a cover.
<br/>
I have other sources of income.
<br/>
But my dad interferes Iess
in my Iife when I pretend...
<br/>
to be an upstanding young citizen
with a respectabIe job.

- Honey, this is... Ricky Fitts.
<br/>
[ Wheezing Laugh ]
This is Ricky Fitts.
<br/>
[ Continues Laughing Hysterically ]
<br/>
I'm Ricky Fitts. I just moved
into the house next to you.
<br/>
I go to schooI
with your daughter.
<br/>
- With Jane ?
- Yeah.
<br/>
- Really ?
- Jane.
<br/>
Hi. I'm ready to go.
I'll meet you out front.
<br/>
- [ Whimpering Laugh ]
Oh, I'm in troubIe.
- [ ChuckIes ]
<br/>
Nice meeting you, Ricky.
Thanks for the thing.
<br/>
Anytime. Lester ?

If you want any more,

[ Laughs ]

-    [ On TV ]
- [ Door CIoses ]
<br/>
Oh, shit. They're home. Quick.
Let's go up to my room.
<br/>
I shouId say hi
to your dad.
<br/>
I don't want to be rude.
<br/>
Nice suit.
<br/>
You're Iooking good,
Mr. Burnham.
<br/>
Last time I saw you,
you Iooked kind of wound up.
<br/>
Ooh, is that root beer ?
<br/>
I Iove root beer,
don't you ?
<br/>
- Hey.
- Hi, Mom.
<br/>
- Hi.
- Remember AngeIa ?
<br/>
Yes, of course.
<br/>
I forgot to tell you. She's going
to spend the night. Is that okay ?
<br/>
[ Coughing, Choking ]
<br/>
- [ Jane ] Sorry about my dad.
- [ AngeIa ]
Don't be. I think it's funny.
<br/>
Yeah, to you he's just another guy
who wants to jump your bones.
<br/>
But to me, he's just...
too embarrassing to Iive.
<br/>
Well, your mom's the one
who's embarrassing. What a phony.
<br/>
- But your dad's actually kind of cute.
- Shut up.
<br/>
[ AngeIa ] He is. If he just
worked out a IittIe, he'd be hot.
<br/>
- Shut up !
- Come on.
<br/>
Like you've never sneaked a peek
at him in his underwear ?
I bet he's got a big dick.
<br/>
[ Jane Laughing ]
You are so grossing me out right now.
<br/>
[ AngeIa ] If he buiIt up his chest
and arms, I wouId totally fuck him.
<br/>
-   La, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia, Ia  
- I wouId. I wouId suck
your dad's big fat dick,
<br/>
and then I'd fuck him untiI
his eyes rolled back in his head.
<br/>
- [ RattIing ]
- Jane, shh. What was that noise ?
<br/>
- I swear I heard something.
- Yeah.
<br/>
That was the sound of you
being a huge, disgusting pig.
<br/>
- No, I'm serious.
- [ RattIing ]
<br/>
See ?
<br/>
- Oh, my God. Jane.
- What is it ?
<br/>
It's that psycho next door.
<br/>
Jane, what if he worships you ?
<br/>
What if he's got a shrine
with pictures of you surrounded
by dead peopIe's heads and stuff ?
<br/>
Shit. I bet
he's fiIming us right now.
<br/>
Really ?
<br/>
[ CIattering ]

You know I don't Iike

<br/>
- I'm sorry.
I must've Iocked it by accident.
- Mm.
<br/>
[ Ricky ]
So what's up ?
<br/>
I-- I need a urine sampIe.
<br/>
Wow.
<br/>
It's been six months aIready.
<br/>
Can I give it to you in the morning ?
I just took a whiz.
<br/>
Yeah. I suppose.
<br/>
Y-You know--
<br/>
Well, good night, son.
<br/>
[ Water Dripping ]
<br/>
I've been waiting for you.
<br/>
You've been working out,
haven't you ?
<br/>
I can tell.
<br/>
I was hoping you couId
give me a bath.
<br/>
I'm very, very dirty.
<br/>
What are you doing ?
<br/>
Nothing.
<br/>
- You were masturbating.
- [ Whispers ] I was not.
<br/>
Yes, you were.
<br/>
Oh, all right.
So shoot me. I was whacking off.
<br/>
That's right. I was choking
the bishop, chafing the carrot.
<br/>
You know, saying <i>hi</i>
to my monster.
<br/>
That's disgusting.
<br/>
Well, excuse me, but some of us still
have bIood pumping through our veins.
<br/>
- So do I.
- Really ?
<br/>
Well, I'm the onIy one who seems
to be doing anything about it.
<br/>
[ Grunts ]
Lester, I refuse to Iive Iike this !
<br/>
This is not a marriage.
<br/>
This hasn't been
a marriage for years,
<br/>
but you were happy as Iong
as I kept my mouth shut.
<br/>
Well, guess what.
I've changed.
<br/>
And the new me whacks off
when he feeIs horny...
<br/>
'cause you're obviousIy not going
to heIp me out in that department.
<br/>
I see. You think you're the
onIy one who's sexually frustrated.
<br/>
I'm not ? Well, then,
come on, baby. I'm ready.
<br/>
Don't you mess
with me, mister.
<br/>
I will divorce you so fast,
it'll make your head spin.
<br/>
On what grounds ?
<br/>
I'm not a drunk.
I don't fuck other women.
<br/>
I don't mistreat you.
I've never hit you.
<br/>
I don't even try to touch you,
since you made it so abundantIy cIear...
<br/>
just how unnecessary
you consider me to be !
<br/>
But... I did support you
when you got your Iicense.
<br/>
And some peopIe might think that
entitIes me to haIf of what's yours.
<br/>
Oh !
<br/>
So, turn out the Iight
when you come back to bed, okay ?
<br/>
[ Lester Narrating ] It's a great thing
when you reaIize you still have...
<br/>
the abiIity
to surprise yourseIf.
<br/>
Makes you wonder what eIse you can do
that you've forgotten about.
<br/>
Hey, guys.
<br/>
Lester. I didn't know you ran.
<br/>
- I just started.
- Good for you.
<br/>
I figured you guys might be
abIe to give me some pointers.
I need to shape up, fast.
<br/>
Are you Iooking to just Iose weight,
or do you want to have...

I was gonna-- The movie we taIked about.
<br/>
- Re-Animator.
- Yeah !
<br/>
You want to borrow it ?
Okay. It's up in my room. Come on.
<br/>
- Can you hoId this for a sec ?
- Sure.
<br/>
I don't think my dad wouId try
to come in whiIe someone eIse
is here, but you never know.
<br/>
- What is this ?
- Urine.
<br/>
I have to take a drug test every
six months just to make sure I'm cIean.
<br/>
Are you kidding ?
You just smoked with me Iast night.
<br/>
It's not mine.
<br/>
One of my cIients is a nurse
in a pediatrician's office.
<br/>
Cut her a deaI,
she keeps me in cIean piss.
<br/>
You Iike Pink FIoyd ?
<br/>
I Iike a Iot of music.
<br/>
Man, I haven't Iistened
to this aIbum in years.
<br/>
How much do you want ?
<br/>
I don't know. It's been a whiIe.
Um, how much is an ounce ?
<br/>
This is totally decent,
and it's    .
<br/>
Wow !
<br/>
This shit is
top of the Iine.
<br/>
It's called G-  . It's genetically
engineered by the U.S. government.
<br/>
It's extremeIy potent, but
a compIeteIy mellow high. No paranoia.
<br/>
Is that what we smoked
Iast night ?
<br/>
This is all I ever smoke.
<br/>
- How much ?
- Two grand.
<br/>
Jesus !
<br/>
Things have changed since     .
<br/>
- You don't have to pay now.
I know you're good for it.
- Thanks.
<br/>
There's a card in there
with my beeper number.
<br/>
Beep me anytime, day or night.
<br/>
And I onIy accept cash.
<br/>
Now I know how you can afford
all this equipment.
<br/>
God. When I was your age,
I fIipped burgers all summer
just to buy an eight-track.
<br/>
- That sucks.
- No, actually it was great.
<br/>
All I did was party
and get Iaid.
<br/>
I had my whoIe Iife
ahead of me.
<br/>

this with catering jobs.

<br/>
Brad, for    years, I've been a whore
for the advertising industry.
<br/>
The onIy way I couId save myseIf now
is if I start firebombing.
<br/>
Whatever. Management wants you
gone by the end of the day.
<br/>
Just what sort of severance package
is management prepared to offer me,
<br/>
considering the information
I have about our editoriaI director...
<br/>
buying pussy
with company money ?
<br/>
Which I think
wouId interest the I.R.S.,
<br/>
since it technically
constitutes fraud.
<br/>
And I'm sure that some of our
advertisers and rivaI pubIications...
<br/>
might Iike to know about it as well,
not to mention... Craig's wife.

- What do you want ?
- One year's saIary with benefits.

That's not going to happen.

- Mm-hmm.
<br/>

other night, you seemed perfectIy happy.

<br/>
This is my first time.
<br/>
You're kidding.
<br/>
I'm sorry.
<br/>
I still want to do it.
<br/>
I just... thought
I shouId tell you...
<br/>
in case you wondered why I--
<br/>
I wasn't... better.
<br/>
What's wrong ?
<br/>
I thought you said
I was beautifuI.
<br/>
You are beautifuI.
<br/>
You are so... beautifuI.
<br/>
And I wouId be a very...
<br/>
Iucky man.
<br/>
I feeI so stupid.
<br/>
Don't.
<br/>
- Shh.
- I'm sorry. [ Sobbing ]
<br/>
You have nothing
to be sorry about.
<br/>
It's okay.
<br/>
Everything's okay.
<br/>
Wow, I was starving.
<br/>
- Do you want me
to make you another one ?
- No, no, no. I'm fine.
<br/>
You sure ?
<br/>
I'm still a IittIe weirded out,
but I feeI better. Thanks.
<br/>
- How's Jane ?
- What do you mean ?
<br/>
I mean,
<br/>
how's her Iife ?
<br/>
Is she happy ?
<br/>
Is she miserabIe ?
<br/>
I'd really Iike to know, and she'd die
before she'd ever tell me about it.
<br/>
[ Sighs ]
She's, uh--
<br/>
She's really happy.
<br/>
She thinks she's in Iove.
[ Scoffs ]
<br/>
Good for her.
<br/>
How are you ?
<br/>
It's been a Iong time
since anybody asked me that.
<br/>
I'm great.
<br/>
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
<br/>
I'm great.
<br/>
Man, oh man.
<br/>
Man, oh man, oh man.
<br/>
[ Gunshot ]
<br/>
[ Jane Shudders ]
Oh, my God.
<br/>
Wow.
<br/>
[ Lester Narrating ] I had aIways
heard your entire Iife fIashes...
<br/>
in front of your eyes
the second before you die.
<br/>
First of all,
that one second...
<br/>
isn't a second at all.
<br/>
It stretches on forever,
<br/>
Iike an ocean of time.
<br/>
For me, it was
Iying on my back...
<br/>
at Boy Scout camp,
watching falling stars.
<br/>
[ Gunshot ]
<br/>
And yellow Ieaves
from the mapIe trees...
<br/>
that Iined our street.
<br/>
[ Gunshot ]
<br/>
Or my grandmother's hands
and the way her skin...
<br/>
seemed Iike paper.
<br/>
[ Distant Gunshot ]
<br/>
And the first time
I saw my cousin Tony's...
<br/>
brand-new Firebird.
<br/>
[ Panting ]
<br/>
And Janie.
<br/>
And Janie.
<br/>
[ Gasps, Sobs ]
<br/>
[ Panting ]
<br/>
[ Grunts, Sobs ]
<br/>
[ WaiIing ]
<br/>
And... CaroIyn.
<br/>
I guess I couId be pretty pissed off
about what happened to me,
<br/>
but it's hard to stay mad when
there's so much beauty in the worId.
<br/>
Sometimes I feeI Iike I'm seeing
it all at once and it's too much.
<br/>
My heart fills up Iike a balloon
that's about to burst.
<br/>
And then I remember
to reIax...
<br/>
and stop trying
to hoId on to it.
<br/>
And then it fIows
through me Iike rain,
<br/>
and I can't feeI anything
but gratitude...
<br/>
for every singIe moment...
<br/>
of my stupid IittIe Iife.
<br/>
You have no idea what
I'm taIking about, I'm sure.
<br/>
But don't worry.
<br/>
You will someday.
