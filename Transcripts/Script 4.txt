On the thud sound, the title card with the release date "FALL 2003" slides down from the top of the screen.
<br/>

<br/>
The release date zooms off after the last note of the song.

The sequel begins in a certain neighborhood on one sunny day, months after the events of the original film. Like the first film, we hear the voice of Pongo narrating.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: It seems like such a short time ago that my pet and I were just lazing about in our little London flat, living the humdrum bachelor life, and wishing things weren't so very, very dull. 
<br/>
In the house, Roger set a box down on top of his piano, playing some more keys.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: Oh, that's my pet, Roger. My name's Pongo. You remember, I'm the one with the spots.
<br/>
Then the box sprung open with two of the 99 pups barking happily.
<br/>
Roger: Oh, goodness! 
<br/>
He chuckled as he took one of the pups out of the box.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: No, no, not that one. (as the second pup falls out of the box) Or that one.
<br/>
The father dalmatian, the one narrating, gasped as he quickly caught the pup with his nose.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: Ah, that's me, living my new life as a family man. Never a dull moment. I guess I got my wish.
<br/>
The pup licked his father's cheek, and many of the other dalmatian pups that were in the room all barked happily. Roger set down the pup he was holding, before whistling a bit, and then playing a couple notes on a trombone he had. Then he turned, and an instrument case popped open with four more pups inside, surprising the man. 
<br/>
Roger: Ahh!
<br/>
The surprised man still laughed as he picked up one of the four pups, which licked his nose.
<br/>
Roger: I think I'm seeing spots! 
<br/>
He then gets an idea for a new song. 
<br/>
Roger: Hey, seeing spots!
<br/>
He set the pup down as he started playing his piano, starting his new song.
<br/>
Roger: (singing) Spots, I'm seeing spots!
Everywhere, I'm seeing lots,
Of those tiny little dots!
Yes, it's true.
<br/>
Two pups bounced on a pillow, and some others played near packed pots, with Lucky appearing out of one.
<br/>
Roger: (singing) They're on the beds and the cots
In the pans and the pots
And they've left little spots in the loo.
<br/>
Down below, Anita, who was packing for the move, called up to her husband while more of the 99 puppies ran about.
<br/>
Anita: Roger, are you packing or playing?
<br/>
Roger: I'm...playing at packing, dear!
<br/>
Anita: (chuckling) Well, quit fooling around. We're moving first thing in the morning.
<br/>
She went around, holding the box she had as she placed another picture in there, singing a familiar song.
<br/>
Anita: (singing) We'll have a Dalmatian plantation
La la-la-la-la la-la-la
<br/>
Back upstairs, Roger was still singing as he packed a stack of towels in a box, which he was bringing downstairs with Pongo following.
<br/>
Roger: (singing) I see spots on the walls
In the rooms, in the halls
On the floors, in the drawers, yes, I do
<br/>
Pongo panted happily, and as his pet sang, more of the pups were playing. Rolly and Spotty were playing tug-of-war with a sock, before the latter pulled it away, winning and sending the tubby pup rolling to three other pups who were stacking themselves up beside one of the boxes. When Rolly knocked them down, the box was also toppled over onto them.
<br/>
Roger: (singing) And every morning when I rise
And I open up my eyes
I am taken by surprise
<br/>
Roger continued while trying to make it around the running pups, with one holding a slipper and being chased by their sibling, until they started skidding across the floor. 
<br/>
Roger: (singing) 'Cause instead of seeing skies
I see lots of little spots
<br/>
The one with the slipper in their mouth tried to stop but crashed into the box, and so did the pursuing sibling. As Roger and Anita packed separately, they sang both songs at the same time.
<br/>
Anita: (singing) We'll have a Dalmatian plantation
<br/>
Roger: (singing) Spots, spots, spots!
<br/>
Anita: (singing) And never again shall we roam
<br/>
Roger: (singing) Everywhere on the pans and the pots
<br/>
Roger grabbed Anita by surprise and started dancing with her.
<br/>
Anita: (singing) Can't wait to begin our sweet living that's in
<br/>
Roger: (singing) On the walls...
<br/>
Perdita, looking after her pups, saw her pets dancing and singing, and she smiled. As the two sang, the pups all barked happily.
<br/>
Both: (singing) Our Dalmatian plantation home
Dalmatian plantation, we're home!
<br/>
Once the couple was done with their songs, Roger dipped Anita and held her.
<br/>
Anita: (laughing) Oh, Roger!
<br/>
The dalmatian parents looked at each other with pride.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: (narrating) Yes, tomorrow would be moving day. Only one more night in this little flat which was getting smaller by the minute. 
<br/>
Then some of the running puppies leaped onto their father, tackling him. Pongo found himself covered by a bevy of his children crawling over him, but was enjoying it nonetheless.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: I mean, even I was beginning to feel a bit smothered. Really. 
<br/>
As most of the pups ran and played, one of them in particular, Patch, to be exact, was staring alone in front of the TV, which was not on.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: It was easy to see how one of our puppies could feel...well, just a little bit lost in this...sea of spots. 
<br/>
The mother dalmatian came beside her son.
<br/>
Perdita: Hello, Patch.
<br/>
Patch: Hello, Mother.
<br/>
Perdita: Watching the television, are we?
<br/>
Patch: Yes. (scratching his ear) Well, I've got to save my spot, now, don't I? It's the best spot, after all.
<br/>
Perdita: Ahh, but you know your show doesn't start until after...
<br/>
Nanny's Voice: Dinnertime!
<br/>
In the kitchen, Nanny poured kibble from the bags in various bowls. The puppies gasped upon hearing the kibble rain down into their bowls. Perdita knew what was to happen at this time.
<br/>
Perdita: Oh, dear.
<br/>
Patch: (sees all his siblings stampeding in his direction) Oh, not again!
<br/>
The unlucky pup caught scooped up by the puppy stampede who excitedly rushed to their dinner, not thinking about Patch, who was unwillingly surfing over them as he yelped.
<br/>
Patch: Ehh! Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
<br/>
Once the sea of raging pups got near the doorway, Patch was knocked off and onto the floor. He saw all his 99 siblings chowing down from their bowls, but they pretty much blocked all ways Patch could use to get to his share of the kibble. As Nanny washed the dishes, Patch tried to get to a bowl of his own.
<br/>
Patch: (trying to get through two of his siblings) Come on, you guys! Make room!
<br/>
But he ended up being pushed back.
<br/>
Patch: Ugh!
<br/>
As Rolly was eating from one bowl with his belly covering another, the chuckling Nanny scolded him.
<br/>
Nanny: No, you don't, Mr. Roly-poly. One bowl at a time.
<br/>
So he sheepishly removed his belly from the second bowl. The eager Patch saw this opportunity and went for the bowl, but Penny and Blackie noticed the bowl, and started to eat out of it together. When they were done, Patch looked and was disappointed not to find so much as a crumb remaining in the bowl. As the other pups scampered away, finished, he tried looking in the remaining bowls for any crumbs but alas, there was none. He spotted the empty Kanine Krunchies bag and rushed over, hoping to find one speck of kibble remaining. 
<br/>
Patch: There must be something in here.
<br/>
He dived into the bag, and dug every inch of the interior, with one small speck of kibble dropping out. Rolly, who still hadn't left, saw the kibble, but did not acknowledge that Patch was still there (nor did he know he hadn't eaten any kibble yet), so he just helped himself to it and left the room, leaving Patch disappointed.
Roger: (passing by in the hallway) Right! Is everybody ready for the show?
<br/>
Patch: My spot!
<br/>
He rushed around the kitchen, but since the bag was on his head, he couldn't find his way while the show's theme song was heard from the living room. He kept hitting each leg of the table.
<br/>
TV Chorus: (singing) Thunderbo-olt...
<br/>
He then tripped on a chair's spindel and spun around it.
<br/>
TV Chorus: (singing) Thunderbo-olt...
The Mighty Thunderbolt Adventure Hour...
<br/>
Patch: (as he's spinning) Ahhh! Whoa! Heyyy!
<br/>
Once he stopped spinning, he flew out of the bag, slid across the floor and went into the living room to reclaim his spot. However, to his dismay, all the pups were crowding the TV. 
<br/>
TV Chorus: (singing) "...the one-of-a-kind wonder dog!"
<br/>
Announcer: Kanine Krunchies, the crunch your dog loves to munch, presents "The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour," starring Thunderbolt, the one-of-a-kind wonder dog! 
<br/>
On the set, the TV show's logo appeared, with an oval featuring the star of the show himself, Thunderbolt, with another oval appearing, featuring a new dog, a corgi named Little Lightning, the sidekick added to show for kids' appeal.
<br/>
Announcer: And his trusty sidekick, Little Lightning. 
<br/>
We see a recap of the previous episode with a boy named Wholesome Tommy and his parents were saying grace at dinner when without warning, a hand reached in through the window and snatched the boy right out from under his parents' noses.
<br/>
Announcer: In last week's thrilling episode, wholesome Tommy was kidnapped...
<br/>
The next thing you know, Tommy was tied up while on the back of a horse being rode by a familiar outlaw villain.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Help, Thunderbolt, save me!
<br/>
Announcer: ...and spirited away by that black-hearted villain: Dirty Dawson!
<br/>
Next, we see Tommy tied to the end of a canoe that Dirty Dawson was rowing sideways.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!
<br/>
Announcer: Will our hero arrive in time?
<br/>
The next thing shown was Tommy tied upside-down to a balloon basket in which Dirty Dawson was sailing in.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!
<br/>
Announcer: What horrible fate awaits, wholesome Tommy? Oh, I can hardly look!
<br/>
Patch: Oh, I've seen this one. This is brilliant!
<br/>
Tommy was now tied to the chimney of a train.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Help, Thunderbolt! Save me!
<br/>
The kidnapper put some rope over the boy's mouth as well.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson: That mangy mutt can't save you this time!
<br/>
He then cackled evilly.
<br/>
Patch: (hops on top of one of his siblings) Hold on, Tommy! Thunderbolt's coming!
<br/>
Then, on cue, Thunderbolt came to the top of the cliff and did his signature bark. Following him came Lightning who tripped along his way up but still made it to his side. Thunderbolt looked for the train and he spotted it coming around the mountain, with Dirty Dawson still laughing wickedly. Thunderbolt sprang into action as he raced down the mountain to reach the train and Tommy. Patch leaped onto a box where two more of his siblings were, but in the process, the leap knocked them both off.
<br/>
Both: (randomly) Ahh! Hey!
<br/>
Patch: This is just like "Double-cross at Dead Man's Ditch," except that was a mine car, not a train.
<br/>
Both: Shh! 
<br/>
Once Thunderbolt and Lightning reached the train, the former let out his bark, getting the villain's attention as he turned with an angry glare. The German Shepard growled as he neared towards Dirty Dawson, and Patch started imitating his hero. Then Dirty Dawson got out his whip and started whipping at both dogs, who quickly dodged it. He kept cracking the whip as Patch went by Rolly.
<br/>
Patch: Watch this. Thunder's gonna grab the whip.
<br/>
Pups: Shhh!
<br/>
Spotty: Patch, you're gonna spoil it again!
<br/>
Lightning went to untie Tommy, pulling at the ropes with his teeth while Thunderbolt was busy with Dirty Dawson, who neared the hero as he slipped off the cart and held on to its edge. He looked down, finding himself trapped, and the villain stood over the hero dog with a menacing taunting grin.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson: They say every dog has his day, but this' ain't gonna be yours, ya flea-bitten cur! 
<br/>
He twirled his whip high above him as he laughed maniacally, with Thunderbolt wondering what he'd do, but then, to his luck, he saw another train coming his way, chugging right next to the one he's on. He got an idea as he smirked to Dirty Dawson, who was confused by the look.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson: Huh?
<br/>
The German Shephard leaped from the train to the roof of the next, and then, with great speed, he leaped back onto the first train, but behind Dirty Dawson, surprising the villain. Thunderbolt then grabbed the whip and constricted the villain with it. The villain muffled with part of the whip covering his mouth before the sly Thunderbolt let go of the whip, as Dirty Dawson fell backwards into the roof of the train car, yelling while muffled. The puppies all barked with happiness at Thunderbolt defeating the villain again.
<br/>
Patch: Whoo-hoo! Yes! Yes! 
<br/>
The grunting villain struggled but then heard an angry mooing voice.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson: Huh? 
<br/>
He looked up and sure enough, there was an angry bull inside the car, who blew steam at the foe out of his nostrils, blowing his hat off. Outside the car, with a sign saying "Danger: Angry Bull", we hear noises of violence, angry mooing, shouting and screaming as the car itself shook, rattled and jumped up and down.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson's Voice: This ain't fair! Oww-hoo-hoo! Mama!
<br/>
Lightning and the untied Tommy were on top of a rock, watching the train leave, and Thunderbolt then came back to the top of the cliff, doing his signature bark. Patch came beside the TV and tried imitating the bark, only for it to have a squeak at the end. This resulted in all the siblings to laugh hysterically.
<br/>
Penny: What was that supposed to be? (falls back) Heh heh heh heh!
<br/>
Patch's smile disappeared upon seeing his siblings laughing and ridiculing his bark.
<br/>
Rolly: It was the most pitiful bark I've heard yet.
<br/>
Pepper: Yeah, it sounded like someone sat on a squeaky toy!
<br/>
They continued laughing while Patch gave a glare before it changed to a sad frown of defeat as he climbed back down. Then, on the show, after Tommy was returned to his family, he embraced the hero dog warmly. Patch who was sadly walking away turned around to hear Tommy say one more thing to the hero dog.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Ahh, Thunderbolt, you're one-of-a-kind!
<br/>
Patch's eyes beamed at what the boy had said.
<br/>
Patch: (whispering) Wow! One-of-a-kind!
<br/>
He smiled widely and cutely, feeling inspired by those words. As an iris closed on Thunderbolt, he gave a wink to the viewers. Then once the show was done, it faded to the Kanine Krunchies commercial before Pongo went in front of the TV to speak to his kids.
<br/>
Pongo: All right, bedtime, everyone.
<br/>
Pups: Awwww!
<br/>
Penny: But, Dad, (yawns) we're not sleepy yet.
<br/>
Anita then called to Nanny upstairs.
<br/>
Anita: Nanny, do you have the new dog tags?
<br/>
Nanny: (pulls out bag of tags) Right here. We'll put them on as they come up the stairs.
<br/>
The pups began to walk away from the TV, when another ad appeared, with the same Kanine Krunchies spokesman speaking.
<br/>
Kanine Krunchies spokesman: Say, kiddies! Is your dog a one-of-a-kind wonder dog?
<br/>
This got Patch's attention as he went back to the TV, and eagerly paid attention to this ad.
<br/>
Kanine Krunchies spokesman: If you think your pooch has what it takes, bring him down to the London set of Thunderbolt's exciting new adventure, "Thunderbolt Versus the Hound of the Baskervilles."
<br/>
This announcement made Patch wag his tail in excitement.
<br/>
Patch: Thunderbolt's in London?
<br/>
Kanine Krunchies spokesman: That's right! Thunderbolt's in London. Just follow a Kanine Krunchies truck down to (motions to empty stage in the park) tomorrow's auditions where one lucky pup will win the opportunity to appear as a guest on the show.
<br/>
This chance to meet his hero excited Patch very much. He rushed off to ask Pongo for permission.
<br/>
Patch: Dad! Dad! Dad!
<br/>
With Pongo, he was counting all his children, one by one, as they climbed up the stairs.
<br/>
Pongo: 56, 57, 58... 
<br/>
He saw Fidget having trouble on the top staircase as she squirmed.
<br/>
Pongo: Careful.
<br/>
He used his snout to help her up before resuming counting.
<br/>
Pongo: 59, 60, 61, 62... 63, 64...
<br/>
Patch raced to the nearby sofa, climbed on top of it and spoke eagerly to his dad.
<br/>
Patch: Dad! Dad! I have to see Thunderbolt! 
<br/>
Pongo: J-J-Just a minute, son. I'm counting.
<br/>
Patch: But, Dad! 67, 68, 69... 
<br/>
Patch: I've seen every episode... all 72. 
<br/>
Pongo: 72, 73... 2? Uh...(chuckles) Not now, Patch. I'm busy losing count here! 76, 77, 78, 79...
<br/>
He then tried climbing upstairs to get his dad's attention.
<br/>
Patch: But, Dad! Dad! (gets knocked back by his siblings) Whoa!
<br/>
Pongo: 81, 82, 83... 
<br/>
Patch then took a tumble down the stairs.
<br/>
Pongo: Oh, dear. (goes down stairs and counts remaining pups) Uh, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, and Patch, 105. 105? (to Patch) Are you all right, son?
<br/>
Patch: Dad, I've just got to see Thunderbolt tomorrow.
<br/>
Pongo: Yes, I know, but tomorrow is moving day. You're going to love it on the farm, son. There are big green fields and a stream and a barn and lots of different animals. (smirks) Hey, maybe you and I can chase some chickens, huh?
<br/>
Patch: (tries to smile) Uh, sure, Dad, but...
<br/>
Then Nanny scooped up Patch and gave him his new golden tag with their new address on it.
<br/>
Nanny: Here we go! "Cherry Tree Farm, Little Tichfield, Devon." Hmm. (brings him up stairs) Why, I imagine it's the most splendid farm in the whole country.
<br/>
Patch seemed miserable as Nanny took him up. Pongo then spoke to Perdita.
<br/>
Pongo: Oh, Perdy, the farm will be such a wonderful place to raise our puppies.
<br/>
Perdita: And best of all, we'll be miles away from that evil, ugly monster...

<br/>
Cruella: Cruella de Vil! 
<br/>
Where she was, she was trying to get into a fur shop, but the owner, Mr. Fenwick closed the door on her, but she struggled to get in.
<br/>
Cruella: Now, please let me in!
<br/>
Mr. Fenwick fought back, holding the door back as best as he could.
<br/>
Mr. Fenwick: I can't do that, Miss De Vil.
<br/>
Cruella: Mr. Fenwick, please, something, anything.
<br/>
Mr. Fenwick: You know very well that the terms of your probation...(manages to close the door and then locks it) don't allow me to sell you any more furs.
<br/>
Cruella: Not even a stole? A muff? (slides down glass of door) A pair of mittens?
<br/>
Mr. Fenwick: No!
<br/>
She then peeked through the mail slot with pleading eyes.
<br/>
Cruella: (cracking voice) One mitten?
<br/>
Mr. Fenwick: No!
<br/>
He then pulled down the "Closed" sign as the defeated Cruella weeped a bit while dejectedly walking to her ramsacked car, getting in.
<br/>
Cruella: Could things possibly be any worse?
<br/>
She turned the key, and to answer her question, the radio played "Cruella DeVille", to her fury.
<br/>
Cruella: (kicking the radio violently) Shut up, shut up, shut up! 
<br/>
The radio then sprang out, officially broken. Cruella sobbed a bit some more as she pulled the stick and started driving her car but normally this time and not like a homicidal maniac. Of course, as she drove down the street, every last part of the vehicle came flying loose, and when she got to the end of the street, there was nothing left but the engine, steering wheel, grill, base, seat, and wheels. After the engine completely died, Cruella broke down sobbing before frustratingly tossing the steering wheel down, getting out and kicking one of the tires, resulting in every remaining part to collapse and smoke to escape. With that, the car was officially no more. She then walked away, sobbing and whimpering some more.
<br/>
Cruella: What does Cruella de Vil have left to live for?
<br/>
As she passed an art gallery for fancy aristocrats, she then stopped with a gasp for something inside had caught her eye. She went back to the window, opened the door, and went inside. She was too awestruck to pay attention to the aristocrats and art critics in front of her as she pushed some of them out of the way, causing some to spill their drinks.
<br/>
Aristocrat: Good grief!
<br/>
She came face-to-face with what she saw: a huge white board with a big, black painted dot in its center. Then a man came approaching behind her.
<br/>
Lars: Tell me...what do you see?
<br/>
Cruella: Everything. Darkness and light, form and content.
<br/>
Lars: And what else?
<br/>
Cruella: Chaos and order, joy and pain.
<br/>
Lars: And there is more than that?
<br/>
Cruella: The possibility of triumph, the certainty of defeat, (reaches out) the culmination of all I've ever reached for, (tightens fist) but could not grasp! (laughs eagerly) I see everything! I see absolutely everything! I feel faint in the presence of such artistic truth. Where is the artist? I simply must meet him!
<br/>
Lars: But you already have. (turns and does odd motions) I am Lars, and I am an undiscovered genius.
<br/>
Cruella: My name is Cruella de Vil, and I'm an overfinanced heiress.
<br/>
Lars: Your passion for my work both repels (slides up to her, face-to-face) and attracts.
<br/>
Cruella: Ooh.
<br/>
Lars: Could you bear the sweet agony of seeing more?
<br/>
Cruella: You mean there's more? 
<br/>
So he led her to a gallery in the back, and in it, was an assortment of artwork featuring white canvases with black spots. Cruella gasped in excitement as she went around, looking at each one.
<br/>
Cruella: Spots! Spots! Spots! Spots!
<br/>
She laughed happily at this gallery.
<br/>
Lars: I have yet to find anyone who truly understood their bleak but beautiful meaning...(does more motions with his arms) that is until I met you.
<br/>
Cruella: This could be it! This could be the cure for my craving! My analyst said I should find something to substitute for my magnificent obsession. But who needs furs when I can soothe my tortured soul with art?
<br/>
Lars: Something tortures you? Tell me what cloud dares cast a shadow on the flower.
<br/>
As Cruella started explaining, her enormous fur coat brushed the hair of Lars, making it stick up but he combed it back down.
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, it's a sad but familiar tale of loss and disappointment, probation, and a restraining order. (laughs a bit) But you, you can help Cruella to forget all that. (dramatically) Will you do a painting just for me to ease my pain?
<br/>
The artist paused as he raised an eyebrow.
<br/>
Lars: I will create a masterpiece...if you will be my... muse.
<br/>
Cruella: Ooh. Oh, darling.
<br/>
She laughed some more.

<br/>
Back at the Dearlys' soon-to-be former address, all the dalmatians were asleep in the music room. Most were sleeping in boxes, and others in drawers. One sleep-blew into a trumpet, while another's tail strummed against a bass, and another blew at a music book, turning the pages with the blows. Of course, one pup could not sleep a wink, and that was Patch. He still felt lost in this sea of spots, and frankly, the fact that Rolly was lying next to his head, with the foot sleep-kicking him in the face. Patch got up, sighing, before moving to another spot and trying to fall asleep, but then Freckles snored loudly right next to him, forcing him to cover his ears. Then a drop of saliva was dripping up and down from the mouth of the snoozing Dipstick up above, before it let go and dropped on Patch's head. Patch shook it off in frustration, glaring at Dipstick.
<br/>
Pongo: (talking in his sleep) 6...7...26... 202. 
<br/>
The pup went under his dad's ear.
<br/>
Patch: Dad? 
<br/>
Pongo: 97... 
<br/>
Patch: I can't sleep. 
<br/>
Pongo: 98...
<br/>
Patch: I've been thinking. 
<br/>
Pongo: 90... 
<br/>
Patch: Do you think I'm one-of-a-kind...or just...one of 101? 
<br/>
Pongo: (yawns) 101. That's it. 101. 
<br/>
Patch, misunderstanding his father, was in shock and sadness. He sighed sadly before leaving the room, going downstairs and then into the kitchen. He looked around for a place to sleep. He then spotted the Kanine Krunchies bag inside the closet, and saw Thunderbolt's picture on it. He decided to crawl into the bag and sleep there for the night.
The next morning, the sun was rising slowly as Patch was snoozing when he heard faint barking along with Roger's voice.
<br/>
Roger's Voice: All right, everyone, into the truck! 
<br/>
That fully woke him up in alarm. He realized that his family was leaving. Patch then scrambled around the kitchen, trying to get to the moving truck before everyone left.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: You're 90, you're 91, you're 92, you're 93, you're 94. Hold it. Wait. 
<br/>
He scrambled around the empty living room and raced toward the window.
<br/>
Pongo's Voice: You're 98, you're 99...you're 100...and you're 101. 
<br/>
Once at the window, he saw his whole family already in the back of the moving truck, with Roger removing the walkway that the dogs climbed up while Pongo was counting his family members again.
<br/>
Pongo: And you're 101, and you're 101. Hold it. Wait. How many 101s are there? Well, I've successfully lost count again. Right. Anyone not here, speak up. 
<br/>
Patch barked out in distress, but alas, no one heard him. Roger then closed the back of the truck and went to the driver's seat of the truck, to Patch's alarm.
<br/>
Patch: Oh, no! 
<br/>
He tried to squeeze his way through the open window, to no avail. Then the truck pulled out and away from their former home.
<br/>
Patch: Wait! Wait for me! 
<br/>
Sadly, still no one heard him and they were already gone.
<br/>
Patch: Well, that figures. They didn't even miss me. 
<br/>
Then he heard a familiar jingle and saw the Kanine Krunchies truck driving by.
<br/>
Patch: (smirks) Then I'm not gonna miss them! 
<br/>
Then he squeezed through the open window and was successful this time. He then chased after the Kanine Krunchies truck, before hopping onto the bumper, taking the ride to the auditions for Thunderbolt's show.
<br/>
-
<br/>
As time passed, the moving truck drove through the countryside, as Roger, Anita and Nanny hummed "Dalmatian Plantation" on the way. They were approaching their new home in the country.
<br/>
Roger: Well, what do you think? 
<br/>
Anita: (hugs Roger) Why, it's splendid! 
<br/>
Once they arrived at their new home, Roger got out and set up the walkway.
<br/>
Roger: Puppies, welcome to your new home! 
<br/>
Pongo got out first to count his family.
<br/>
Pongo: Right then. (as two puppies started heading down first) That's 1 and 2 and...
<br/>
But as he continued, the rest of the puppies (minus a certain one still in London, unknown to anyone) came racing out of the truck, making it hard for the father to count them all.
<br/>
Pongo: Uh...37, 36, 5, 50, 8, um...minus 2, carry the 3, and, um...(after the puppies were out) 101? 
<br/>
Perdita: Finally, no more counting. 
<br/>
All the puppies present raced across the farm in excitement, ready to explore and see what their new home has to offer. In a pond, a frog heard some barking.
<br/>
Frog: Huh? Waaa! 
<br/>
One of the pups leaped onto the rock the frog was on, forcing the frog to hop off. Then the pup hopped after the frog from rock to rock until splashing onto a lily pad, missing it. Then, four hens were being chased by four of the pups, before they screamed as they fled from an angry rooster. Another one of the pups was being dragged across the soil as he held onto the cow's tail.
<br/>
With the humans, they were entering the house, with Roger pushing the piano inside. Anita and Nanny looked concerned about the interior, because it looked very delapidated. 
<br/>
Roger: All this place needs is a proper dusting, a splash of paint, (stops pushing the piano) and it'll be good as new. Now, where do you suppose we'll put the music room? 
<br/>
Then the floorboards under the piano gave way, surprising the three, as it fell through the hole and crashed down below. The three looked through the newly-made hole.
<br/>
Anita: I think you just found it, darling. 
<br/>
-
<br/>
Back in London, in the same park advertised from last night's commercial, a crowd of people, young and old, and their dogs were gathered in front of the stage for the auditions.
<br/>
Theme Song Chorus: (singing) Thunderbo-olt
Hounding hoodlums with a howl
Bad no-goodniks hear his growl
<br/>
Patch tried to see the stage but couldn't on account of his short stature and everyone blocking his way. He then found a spot so he can see the stage clearly and was excited.
<br/>
Theme Song Chorus: (singing) Thunderbo-olt
Desperadoes, cringe in fear...
<br/>
A man, the producer of the show, appeared on the stage. 
<br/>
Producer: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pooches and pups of all ages, are you ready? 
<br/>
There was entusiastic clamor from the viewers and dogs alike.
<br/>
Producer: Desperadoes, cringe in fear. Mighty Thunderbolt is here! 
<br/>
The curtains parted as the German Shephard everyone's gathered here to see leaped out onto the stage, giving his signature bark. The crowd went wild. Patch made his way through the crowd and was excited to see his hero up on stage. 
<br/>
Patch: I don't believe it! It's really him! 
<br/>
Producer: And here's his sidekick extraordinaire, the ever-trusty Little Lightning! 
<br/>
On cue, Thunderbolt's corgi sidekick came sliding on the stage, but slipped and fell over. He came back up, posing by Thunderbolt's side. Then three fangirl dogs, a poodle and two brown dogs, appeared at the end of the stage.
<br/>
Poodle: Yoo-hoo! 
<br/>
Brown Dog #1: Hello, handsome! 
<br/>
Brown Dog #2: Over here, you gorgeous hunk o' hound. 
<br/>
Lightning saw the girls, thinking they wanted him, and he smiled as he went over to them.
<br/>
Lightning: Oh, uh, hi, ladies. Nice to meet you. 
<br/>
However, the girls frowned.
<br/>
Poodle: Oh, no.
<br/>
Brown Dog #1: We don't want you. 
<br/>
Poodle: Get out of the way. We want... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (jumps up in front of them) Thunderbolt! 
<br/>
Dog fangirls: (swooning) Oooh.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Sorry, little buddy, but these ladies aren't interested in the sidekick. 
<br/>
Lightning hung his head.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: They're here to get a big eyeful of...(as the girl dogs started shaking happily) hero! 
<br/>
Dog fangirls: Aaah! 
<br/>
They then started clawing the stage eagerly.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Heel, ladies, heel. 
<br/>
The dog fangirls clamoured eagerly as the security guard pulled them away, with the stage clawed, leaving shreddings behind.
<br/>
Producer: All right, everybody. Line up your dogs for the audition. We need to hear their best heroic bark. 
<br/>
So the auditions started, and one by one, each dog was brought up to give their best bark. The first was a Scottish terrier who resembled Jock (from Lady and the Tramp). The second was a withering old hound dog who barked before howling a big, long howl. The third was a sheepdog. The fourth was a Chihuahua who gave a loud, annoying yip. We then see Thunderbolt with the old hound again still holding his howl, as Thunderbolt looked at his paw like someone would look at their watch (except he has none). Then Collie auditioned next, giving his bark, while Thunderbolt stood right next to him, giving a serious look. The next to audition was a huge Great Dane, ironically named "Tiny", who gave a huge, loud bark, frightening Thunderbolt.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: V-Very good. 
<br/>
We see Thunderbolt getting a little impatient with the old hound still howling until he stopped.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hey, that's very...(as the hound starts howling again) Oh, there's more! 
<br/>
Patch was on the steps trying to give out his best bark before one of the assistants grabbed him, slid him onto the stage, right next to the TV star. Thunderbolt gave a dashing grin to the pup, who just stood there like a deer in the headlights. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (still grinning) Well...go ahead. 
<br/>
Patch: (looks at the crowd) Uh... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: What's the matter, little fella? Cat got your tongue? (bursts out laughing) Oh, that's funny, 'cause, you see, we're dogs...and we chase cats, so... 
<br/>
Patch gave a nervous look towards the other dogs who auditioned as they were waiting to hear his bark.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ah, well, it made me laugh. (under his breath) Come on, kid, we haven't got all year. You're wasting my valuable limelight. 
<br/>
Patch saw the producer and his assistant getting impatient. So Patch let out the same pathetic squeaky bark from yesterday, and just like his siblings, the people and dogs present all laughed at him, including his hero.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Say, who sat on the squeaky toy? 
<br/>
Patch then hung his head in defeat again, and some reporters and photographers came in front of the stage.
<br/>
Reporter: Hey, Thunderbolt, over here!
<br/>
Thunderbolt gave his daring grin while Patch . At the park, the theme played on the PA while the producer spoke to the crowd again. 
<br/>
Chorus: (singing) Thunderbo-olt...
<br/>
Producer: That's it, folks! We'll announce the winner of the audition tomorrow! 
<br/>
With that, everyone began leaving, except for Patch.
<br/>
Producer: Have a mega-fantabulous day! And remember, buy your pooch lots and lots of tasty Kanine Krunchies! 
<br/>
The producer left, throwing the mike away, but the assistant caught it, though the cord got tangled, causing the theme to distort and some feedback to give out.
<br/>
Chorus: (singing/distorting) ...only in the night
<br/>
The assistant frowned before leaving. Patch, the only one left, sat there on the stage, alone and sad that he blew his big chance to prove he's one of a kind.
<br/>
Patch: Nice work, Patch, just brilliant. 
<br/>
-
<br/>
At Thunderbolt's trailer, the star was crowded by his enormous fan base of dogs, and his three fan girls were asking him to do his signature dashing grin again.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ladies, ladies, you're wearing me out. 
<br/>
Poodle: Oh, please? Just do it one more time. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, well, all right. I guess just one more time couldn't hurt. 
<br/>
He gave his dashing grin, causing the three fangirl dogs to swoon and faint.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (enters his trailer via the doggy flap) Golly, I'm good. 
<br/>
Inside his trailer were all souvenirs, awards and merchandise of himself.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hello, boys! 
<br/>
He used his muzzle to bobble the head of a Thunderbolt bobble-head doll, before he went to put a pillow with his likeness on the couch. Then his sidekick came in through the flap, panting frantically.
<br/>
Lightning: Thunder!
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning, little buddy. 
<br/>
Lightning: It's just awful! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt, however, was playing with his action figures of himself and Dirty Dawson.
<br/>
Lightning: I overheard what they're planning for the next episode.
<br/>
The star used his mouth to hit the toy Dirty Dawson with his toy self repeatedly, before knocking the villain toy off the counter. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Growl! (winces at toy villain falling) Bump! 
<br/>
He chuckled while his sidekick sighed.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ah, don't be too harsh on them, little buddy. I know we don't have the best writers in television but we can always improvise. I'm pretty good at improvising, as long as it's written down for me. 
<br/>
Lightning: No, no, you don't understand. Something really horrible is going to happen. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ooh, ooh, don't tell me. Let me guess. The dam breaks. 
<br/>
Lightning: No.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: The mine collapses.
<br/>
Lightning: No. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (eagerly) Do I get an evil twin? I've always wanted an evil twin. 
<br/>
Lightning: No! Listen, Thunder, what happens is you...you... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Huh? 
<br/>
Lightning: You die. 
<br/>
The German Shephard gasped in shock, leaping in front of his sidekick.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I don't believe it. I- I die? 
<br/>
The sidekick nodded.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (wistfully) Oh, Lightning, this is just...(mood changes abruptly) about the greatest thing ever! Ha ha! I've always wanted to play a big death scene. The selfless hero who sacrifices himself to save the innocent. Ha ha! I'll kick bigger than Old Yeller! Ha ha ha! So, how do I make my shockingly unexpected and triumphant return? 
<br/>
Lightning: You don't.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: What do you mean 'I don't'? 
<br/>
Lightning: You don't make a shockingly unexpected and triumphant return. You die. You're dead. You never come back. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Not even for a reunion show? 
<br/>
Lightning: Not even for a cameo in the remake. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (gasps in horror) They're writing me out of the show! 
<br/>
Lightning: They're gonna replace you with a younger dog. 
<br/>
The German Shepherd panicked as he went up to the window, staring at the auditions stage.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, so that's what those auditions were really all about. Oh, Lightning, you gotta help me. I can't end up on the street, homeless, foraging in trash cans. (gets up in Lightning's face) Mange! I could get mange! 
<br/>
Lightning: Well, I...I did have this one crazy thought. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Or ticks! I hate ticks! (gets in Lightning's face again) They suck all the blood out of you, do you hear me? They suck all the blood out of yoooou! 
<br/>
The corgi fell back.
<br/>
Lightning: What if...you went out and did something heroic like you do on the show, but in the real world? You know, get your name in the paper, prove to 'em that you still got it. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Wait a minute. What if...I went out and did something heroic in the real world? 
<br/>
Lightning: (rolls eyes) Or...that could work, too. After all, you are the one-of-a-kind wonder dog. How hard could it be? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Yeah, it'll be a catwalk.
<br/>
Lightning: Cakewalk. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pre-cisely. I'll just go get a little|press for doing some easy hero stuff and they'll be begging to keep me on the show. But first, I'll have to figure out a way to sneak past my adoring public. 
Patch was outside the trailer, walking dejectedly, but he then heard a noise. He turned and saw Thunderbolt crouch his way out of the trailer's flap, covered with a carpet and mop for a wig. He quickly hid and then sneaked past the crowd of people and their dogs.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak, sneak. (hides behind a tree) Hide. 
<br/>
He saw that no one spotted him.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hmm. Ha ha. Master of disguise. 
<br/>
Patch: Hi, Thunderbolt!
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Aaaaah! Oh, I'm sorry. You've got the wrong dog, kid. 
<br/>
Patch: I know it's you. That's the same disguise you used in episode 18, "Gambling Gophers of Gunfire Gulch." 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh! For howling out loud! Now you've blown my cover. 
<br/>
Patch: This is champion! I'm your biggest fan, Thunderbolt! 
<br/>
As Patch continued, Thunderbolt tossed the mop strings into the trash can and the rug onto Patch.
<br/>
Patch: I know every episode by heart. 
<br/>
The pup then walked along the brick wall, following Thunderbolt, who was looking around to spot if anyone was following him.
<br/>
Patch: Remember the time when you fought that grizzly bear, and rescued those orphans, and then the dam broke and...and... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hey, aren't you the squeaky toy? 
<br/>
Patch: (nervously) Yeah. Heh. That's me. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Listen, pup...
<br/>
Patch: Patch. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pooch, whatever. You've got to understand, (poses boldly) sometimes danger and I like to dance alone! 
<br/>
Patch hung his head sadly. Then Thunderbolt spotted a cat wandering up a tree branch.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Good gracious gravy, look at that! A cat is stuck up in that tree! 
<br/>
Patch: He is? 
<br/>
Of course, neither of them saw that the cat was eagerly heading for the nest of baby birds hanging in the higher branch, and the cat was licking his lips, having a meal on his mind.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, my heart goes out to the poor, helpless creature. Now, if I were me, what would I do? Well, I'd read the script. That's what I'd do. (gasps and eyes widen in horror) Oh, no! I don't have a script! 
<br/>
He began to hyperventelate with Patch not noticing.
<br/>
Patch: This is just like when Tommy was trapped on that cliff in episode 29. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt began to pace back and forth in panic.
<br/>
Patch: That one was a classic.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (to himself) Okay, okay, don't panic. You can do this. 
<br/>
Patch: Only it's also like episode 64...
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You can do this. 
<br/>
Patch: When he was drowning in the water tower.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You can't do this!
<br/>
Patch: Yeah, that was great.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You can't do this! Who am I kidding? I have no idea what I'm doing! 
<br/>
Patch: But episode 29 is still the best, at least from the first season. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt was getting fed up with the pup's rambling.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pooch!
<br/>
Patch: Patch. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Whatever. I'm trying to panic here!
<br/>
Patch: Oh, sorry. I just thought you were gonna do what you did on Raccoon Ridge. 
<br/>
As Patch continued on about the episode, Thunderbolt spotted a waste basket and an overweight window washer washing a window while on a ladder.
<br/>
Patch: You know, when you got that barrel and dragged it next to the cliff, and you found a long plank of wood, and got a great, big, round boulder...
<br/>
Thunderbolt saw the perfect objects to use in the place of the objects Patch mentioned. The waste basket would be the barrel, the plank being the ladder, and the washer being the round boulder.
<br/>
Patch: And then...
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pre-cisely! 
<br/>
He ran over and kicked the waste basket down, then grabbed the ladder with his teeth, causing the window washer to scream as he fell but used his washer blade to stop his fall. Then the German Shephard placed the ladder over the waste basket like a seesaw, and got on top of it, waiting for the fat man to fall on the other side. Thunderbolt then called up to the cat still climbing up the tree for the birds.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hang on, little kitty! Help is on the way! Heh heh heh. The press is gonna love this. 
<br/>
The window washer and his blade were losing grip of the edge of the window. At this point, the cat got to the nest of oblivious baby birds and opened his mouth, giving a malicious hiss. Then the washer finally fell down to the other side of the ladder, catapulting Thunderbolt to the three as he screamed in a comical manner, and in the process of being flung, he broke the branch holding the cat in two. Then the cat screeched a bit as he was sent bouncing down each branch of the tree. Then, when the cat got the bottom, he landed perfectly on his feet. He looked around, seeing he was alright without any harm done to him.
<br/>
Cat: Phew. 
<br/>
Then, Thunderbolt came crashing down on the cat, nearly squishing him flat.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (sees the cat) There you are, my good man. No need to thank me. The look on your face is thanks enough. 
<br/>
The look on the cat's face was a painful look.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Now smile for the cameras. 
<br/>
He gave his dashing grin and paused, but there weren't any photographers.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hey, that's strange. (grin fades) Where are all the photographers? The press is always around when I do something. (annoyed) What's the matter with you English people? Are you all having tea? (gets off the cat) How am I supposed to get my job back if you're all having tea?!
<br/>
The dalmatian puppy was too eager to recognize the anger in his idol's voice ran towards him.
<br/>
Patch: That was champion, Thunder, just like on the telly! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You know, this stuff isn't as easy as it looks. 
<br/>
He then started ranting.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I mean, maybe if I could remember what happened in every episode of the show, you know, like squeaky toy here, then I could... 
<br/>
Then he rose his head up under a store sign ironically shaped like a lightbulb, getting an idea.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hey, squeaky toy. 
<br/>
Patch smiled, feeling like he would have a chance to prove himself to his hero yet.
<br/>
We go back to Cruella's side of the story, and she was at Lars's warehouse, staring at one of his spotted artworks through opera glasses, while Lars was scrubbing his paintbrush with a cloth.
<br/>
Cruella: (grins) Oh, darling, it's just divine! It's remarkable! It's stunning! It's grand! 
<br/>
Lars smiled, glad that she approved of it, but then...
<br/>
Cruella: (grin disappears) But it's all wrong. 
<br/>
Lars's smile disappeared as well.
<br/>
Lars: But...but it--it's my best work yet, Cupcake. 
<br/>
Cruella: But it simply has to be better than your best, darling. I mean, look at these spots. (marks X over a spot with the smoke from her cigarette) Oh, the shapes aren't at all acceptable. They're not (affectionately about something) soft enough. You know, cuddly, like something you want to (clenches fists) squeeze the life out of! Oh, no, this one is no good at all, an embarrassing mediocrity, a complete failure! 
<br/>
She then stuck her cigarette in one of the spots, leaving a burn on the painting, as it started burning.
<br/>
Lars: Your harsh words strike me like blows from the fists of a large dockworker. (childishly) I would cry now...(acts cool) were it not so bourgeois. 
<br/>
Cruella: (pats his head) There, there. I know you'll get it right, my depressive Da Vinci. You simply have to keep trying. After all, you're the only one who truly understands Cruella, who can see into her tortured soul. 
<br/>
As she spoke, the burning hole grew larger.
<br/>
Lars: Yes! Her heart is like a vast, dark ocean on whose waves (holds her hand and looks into her eyes) I am hopelessly adrift in my dinghy of passion. 
<br/>
He chuckled a bit.
<br/>
Lars: I shall not betray your faith in me! I shall create another canvas, and another, and another, and another until I have found spotted perfection! 
<br/>
He then grabbed a fire extinguisher to put out the fires in his artwork's remains to avoid having the whole place go up in flames.
<br/>
Lars: I shall not stop until the fires of your craving have been quenched! 
<br/>
Back with Patch and Thunderbolt, thery walked around in the park.
<br/>
Patch: Junior deputy test? Which episode was that in? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Uh, one of the lost episodes. But I only give it to pups who I think might be worthy. And who knows? If you do real good, maybe I'll even let you|be on the show with me. 
<br/>
Patch: Really? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Sure, kid. I'm the star, aren't I? 
<br/>
Then a buggy ride with a newly wed couple passed by them, but Thunderbolt saw it differently.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Mother of pasteurised milk! That stagecoach is out of control! (to Patch) This is your first junior deputy test, kid. 
<br/>
Patch: Okay. Well...this is just like in episode 37, "Stagecoaches of Serpent Summit." 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Very good. Now, episode 37, was that the one where I leap, run, and pounce? 
<br/>
Patch: No, no. That was the one where you run, pounce, and leap. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pre-cisely! Stand back! 
<br/>
The star dog ran off with Patch happy to watch his hero in real-life action. Thunderbolt ran fast past the buggy, and the couple saw him, looking confused, wondering what the dog was running for.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh
<br/>
Then Thunderbolt ran along a stone wall, hopping onto the horse pulling the wagon.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Get hold of yourself, man! You're out of control! 
<br/>
Hearing that, the horse whinnied in alarm and fear as he started running even faster with the driver trying to get a hold of the horse.
<br/>
Driver: Whoa! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: It's okay! I'll get the brake. 
<br/>
He then hopped onto the side and pulled the brake with his teeth, stopping the buggy and sending the screaming newly weds flying into the air and landing into a nearby lake.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ee-ooh
<br/>
Thunderbolt, thinking he just a heroic deed, did his signature bark. He waited for some press people but then he saw that still none were there. He also didn't acknowledge the dampened newly weds who were trying to help each other out of the lake only to fall back with splashes.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Still no photographers. How odd.
<br/>
Back with Cruella and Lars, Lars had taken a paintbrush and black ink bottle. He stroked around, making a big black blob on the palette, before he took time on his next painting of spots.
<br/>
There may be days when things don't go right
And your shoes refuse to dance
To make the winds of fortune blow right
You might need a second chance
<br/>
After so much time, he finished his newest artwork: a painting that had two diagonal rows of spots, with the size smaller as the rows went up. He was on a ladder showing his new work to his muse, and she only lay on the couch, giving an impressed shake of her head meaning 'no' before she continued smoking. Lars then went back down the ladder to try and whip up something else.
<br/>
So if you get one try and that don't fly
Stop and count to 10
<br/>
Next, Thunderbolt was pulling a rope with his teeth. He was trying to hoist someone out of a manhole to rescue them, and it was a tied-up worker, who was confused at this. Patch was happy to see that this man was safe from harm, as how he viewed it.
<br/>
And if at first you don't succeed
<br/>
Then the two dogs walked in front of a businsess place when Thunderbolt saw something getting his attention.
<br/>
Try again
<br/>
He pulled the pup over to the doorway.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Here's your next test, kid. 
<br/>
They saw the shadow of someone stuffing something in a bag.
<br/>
Patch: Wow! Bank robbers! 
<br/>
The so-called bank robber was actually a normal man taking laundry out of a machine and placing them in his bag.
<br/>
Patch: Uh, Episode 4. 
<br/>
They snuck away as the man carrying his laundry walked out of the laundromat. 
<br/>
Beginner's luck is overrated
<br/>
Thunderbolt hopped from a pick-up truck and began bouncing across the top of the shop.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (as he bounces) Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!
<br/>
Once you blink, it's come and gone
<br/>
He then hopped off and lunged toward the 'bank robber', who saw the dog and was alarmed, as was the dog.
<br/>
Both: Aaaaaah!
<br/>
The only way to cultivate it
<br/>
The two then tumbled, rolling down the street and into a bobby, knocking him down while the laundry was sent everywhere.
<br/>
Is to keep on keepin' on
Yeah
<br/>
Thunderbolt, with a pair of undies over his head, looked around.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hmm? Still no photographers? 
<br/>
He shook it off before walking away, with the two humans left confused.
<br/>
Try and try and then
If at first you don't succeed, yeah
<br/>
The next spot-themed painting Lars did for Cruella was one with the pointilism technique. All the red, black and white spots he painted together formed the picture of Cruella.
<br/>
Try again
<br/>
Try, try again
<br/>
Lars gave his hand out, expecting Cruella's feedback. That feedback was this: the still-unimpressed Cruella taking a magazine she had and covering her face with it.
<br/>
Yes, my friend
<br/>
Try, try, try again
<br/>
Back with Patch and Thunderbolt, they spotted the two royal guards by a certain palace.
<br/>
Patch: Those men are frozen with fear. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: No wonder. Those crazed badgers are trying to eat their heads! 
<br/>
The "crazed badgers" he was referring to were the royal guards' tall hats.
<br/>
Patch: It's just like in episode 27 when you whupped those two grizzlies! 
<br/>
So Thunderbolt took action and leaped in the air, snatching the hats with his teeth.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh
<br/>
Guards: (sensing their hats gone) Huh? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt used his teeth to gnaw on the hats viciously, before tipping over on his side.
<br/>
Eeeb-a-dee-bop sa-dum-wa-dum
<br/>
Back with Lars and Cruella, the artist, with a welder's mask over his face, was using a blowtorch on the finishing touches of his next artwork in attempt to satisfy his client. This artwork was a mobile of huge spots. He flicked one of the spots.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ooh-ooh
And don't you ever stop, no 
<br/>
Down below, Cruella only facepalmed before walking away.
<br/>
Caboodle lay-dee-ee-ee
<br/>
The next stop for the "test" was at the city zoo.
<br/>
Mimmy-zop ba-dum, wa-dum, yeah
<br/>
The pup and German Shephard snuck around the corner and saw two zookeepers leading some monkeys on leads, passing a "Closed for Cleaning" sign.
<br/>
Patch: What is it? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Looks like we've stumbled on a band of cattle rustlers. 
<br/>
Patch: Uh, aren't those monkeys? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Even worse, monkey rustlers! 
<br/>
Patch: Sounds like episode 34 to me. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Right answer once again, junior deputy. 
<br/>
Patch: I passed the test?
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Think you can handle it? 
<br/>
Patch: You bet! Let's get those monkey rustlers! 
<br/>
So the dogs charged into the zoo, and the freaked out monkeys sent running in alarm, chattering frantically with the zookeepers running after them, trying to keep them under control. 
<br/>
Now, if you find you're batting zero 
And a legend you are not
<br/>
Thunderbolt and Patch, thinking they did another heroic deed, came out, barking the Thunderbolt barks, except Patch's was still squeaky.
<br/>
You can still wind up a hero
<br/>
The next spot-related painting Lars tried was Mona Lisa with a small spot above her lips, appearing as a mole. Cruella rolled her eyes.
<br/>
If you give it one more shot
<br/>
Thunderbolt and Patch each appeared out of trash cans somewhere.
<br/>
Then Lars's next painting was a Mickey symbol, as he stuck his head in front of it, making it appear if he was wearing Mickey ears.
<br/>
If you don't give in, you're gonna win 
<br/>
Somewhere else, Thunderbolt and Lars wagged their tails for some reason. Back with Lars, he showed a painting with a spiral of spots to Cruella, and she rolled her eyes again.
<br/>
The only question's "When?" 
<br/>
We see more quick instances of spot-related paintings with Cruella's responses being bored looks, a thumb's down, and a motion of throwing up.
<br/>
So if at first you don't succeed
<br/>
Cruella: (sticks tongue out) Blech! 
<br/>
Back with Thunderbolt and Patch, the two dogs chewed on the guards' hats and then ran around happily in the park. Then, Patch was tossed in the air while on the back of the running Thunderbolt. 
<br/>
Try again 
<br/>
Try, try, try again
Try, try again 
<br/>
And again, yeah
<br/>
Try, try, try again
<br/>
Try again
<br/>
Soon, Thunderbolt was riding a dinner cart out of a fancy restaurant, thinking he was rewarded with a meal for hero work but that was not how an angry chef and waiter saw it. They came out, yelling at the dog as he wheeled his way through the streets.
<br/>
Try, try, try again
<br/>
Then Thunderbolt saw a blue car driving in his direction, making the dog yelp in alarm before careening the other way.
<br/>
Try again
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hey, get over on the right side of the road, buddy! Sheesh! London drivers. 
<br/>
The cart ended up in the park as the hero dog leaped off, and a child's laughing was heard from under the tin. The tin was removed and that laughter belong to Patch.
<br/>
Patch: I told you, Thunder. (chomps one of the sausages) This is the best day ever! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Yeah. You know, I never knew it would be so much fun out here, doing this real hero stuff. 
<br/>
The German Shephard helped himself to a sausage.
<br/>
Patch: What do you mean? Don't you do this all the time? 
<br/>
Hearing that made him swallow his sausage abruptly, not knowing how to break it to the kid.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, well, kid, uh...Well, you know, it's, uh... 
<br/>
He saw the pup's curious look, and not wanting to let him down, he gave his bold tone.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Of course I do! Ha! I do this all the time. So, let's talk about you, kid. 
<br/>
Patch: Me? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Yeah. What's your story?
<br/>
Patch: Well, uh... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hold on. 
<br/>
He took another sausage.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (with mouth full) Okay, go on. 
<br/>
Back at the set, the producer was in shock and utter dismay when he heard from his crew that the star was missing.
<br/>
Producer: Missing?! What do you mean 'he's missing'?!
<br/>
Security Guard: We've looked.
<br/>
Schedule Writer: And looked.
<br/>
Crew Member #3: But there's just no sign of Thunderbolt anywhere. 
<br/>
The producer started to panic and rave.
<br/>
Producer: (shakes third crew member) This is a catastrophe, (rips up schedule) a calamity, (shoves security guard down) a cataclysm! 
<br/>
As he raved, the assistant wrote down his words on a clipboard.
<br/>
Producer: We have to shoot first thing in the morning and I find out my star is missing! (high voice) How can you shoot a show without a star? (slams head against trailer door) How...can you shoot...a show without...a star? 
<br/>
Assistant: How do you spell "cataclysm"? 
<br/>
Producer: (slumps back against door in despair) How can you shoot a show without a star? How can you shoot a show without a... 
<br/>
Then a picture slid out from under the doggy flap and a certain corgi's paw pushed the producer's head down and he saw the picture of Lightning. He then grinned, getting an idea.
<br/>
Producer: A star. (takes picture) This is it. This is megafantabulous! 
<br/>
He then hugged the assistant, to the latter's discomfort and walked away with him.
<br/>
Producer: We'll rewrite this episode and star Little Lightning! I'm a genius! Get the writers! Fire the director! This is going to be a whole new direction for "The Thunderbolt Adventure Hour"! 
<br/>
In the trailer, Lightning peeked outside and overheard the producer, and gave a greedy chuckle.
<br/>
Lightning: A whole new direction. (to a life-size Thunderbolt plush) What do you think of that, Thunderbolt, "old pal"? Finally I'll be able to step out of your shadow, (pushes the plush down) you overrated, overacting ham! 
<br/>
He giggled greedily some more, before lying on the floor next to the plush of the dog he resented.
<br/>
Lightning: "The Little Lightning Adventure Hour"! It has a nice ring, doesn't it? Hmm? What do you think? 
<br/>
He chuckled some more.
Back at the warehouse, the depressed and defeated Lars threw another artwork onto his pile of rejected spot-related artworks.
<br/>
Lars: I have failed you, my muse. 
<br/>
He then dropped to his knees, shouting in despair.
<br/>
Lars: Oh, fickle bird of inspiration, (uses his hands to mimic bird flapping) to what far shore have you flown? 
<br/>
He hung his head in shame while Cruella put her hand over his shoulder.
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, poor, pathetic Lars, do not despair. I know exactly where to find the inspiration we crave. Oh, this is art, after all. Art! Our creativity cannot be thwarted by trivial matters like restraining orders. Yes! Sacrifices must be made! 
<br/>
Of course, when Cruella had arrived at the Dearlys' former home, she saw it was completely empty and there was a "Sold" sign on the door.
<br/>
Cruella: Gone? They're all gone? How unspeakably rude of Anita to move away without even leaving a forwarding address. 
<br/>
She then sat on the doorstep, moping.
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, Lars, now what am I to do? 
<br/>
Then a newspaper was chucked at her in the face. She got up and glared at the paper boy on the bike while shaking the paper in her fist.
<br/>
Cruella: Why, you little...
<br/>
Then she spotted something on the front page.
<br/>
Cruella: What's this? 
<br/>
She saw it was the picture taken earlier of Thunderbolt and Patch. She recognized the latter, and gave a devious grin as she got out some opera glasses.
<br/>
Cruella: I know you. Oh, this is delicious! (reads the collar) "Cherry Tree Farm, Little Tichfield, Devon." 
<br/>
-
<br/>
On that exact farm, the paper had been dropped off at this address as well. Anita went to pick it up, not noticing the picture on the front yet. Some of the pups were running around, chasing the chickens. Nanny was attending to the laundry, humming a tune to herself. Freckles was interested in a hanging sheet as she pulled on it with her mouth before it came down upon her. The passing Anita saw this as she set the paper on the laundry basket down.
<br/>
Anita: (chuckles) Oh, no. 
<br/>
Nanny, not seeing the paper, set another folded clothing on the paper, before heading into the house, carrying the basket of laundry while Anita was trying to help Freckles out of the sheet.
<br/>
Anita: Freckles, dear, stop helping. 
<br/>
Nanny came inside as the piano was coming from the hole in the floor and the tea kettle was heard whistling from the kitchen.
<br/>
Nanny: (gasps) Oh, my! The tea! 
<br/>
She set the basket down near the hole in the staircase and rushed to the kitchen. Some of the pups came rushing down the stairs, hopping on the basket and sending the clothes and paper crashing down into the hole and onto both Roger and Pongo.
<br/>
Roger: Uhh! Yes, the paper. 
<br/>
Pongo shook the laundry off him while Roger took the paper, not bothering to see the picture as he threw it into a trumpet.
<br/>
Roger: No time to read this if I'm going to finish my new song. 
<br/>
He continued working on his new song while Pongo rested.
<br/>
-
<br/>
Back in London, Patch was speaking with Thunderbolt about his life while the pup walked along a brick ledge.
<br/>
Patch: Well, I come from this really big family. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I knew a guy who came from a big litter, 10 or 12. I forget. 
<br/>
Patch: (glumly) There's 101 of us. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: 101 Dalmatians? Hey, I heard about you guys. Yeah, you were on the Twilight Bark. 
<br/>
Patch: Well, that's just it, isn't it? I'm afraid all I'll ever be is one of 101. At least that's what my dad thinks. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt couldn't help but feel sorry for the pup.
<br/>
Patch: Hey, Thunderbolt, how do you become a one-of-a-kind wonder dog anyway? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Well, in my case, it all hinged on getting just the right agent. But, you know, kid, getting there isn't so tough. (gives an angry frown) It's staying on top that's the real challenge. You think you're doing great... ...and all of a sudden there's somebody trying to take your place. 
<br/>
Patch: (gives an equally mad frown) Crowd you out.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Push you aside. 
<br/>
Patch: Steal your spot! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Pre-cisely! 
<br/>
Patch: Pre-cisely! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You know, you're all right, kid. 
<br/>
He pushed his snout against the pup, making him giggle. Then the two went over to a bridge in the park.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I'll tell you what, little buddy, I'm planning on doing some more big-hero stuff today. You stick with me. (as they look at their reflections in the water) Maybe you'll get your picture in the paper, show the world that you're not just another dog. 
<br/>
Patch then happily let out his squeaky bark again.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: No, no, no, like this. Ahem. 
<br/>
He let out his loud signature bark again, sending the pigeons fluttering off.
<br/>
-
<br/>
Back on the farm, some other birds were being startled by dogs. To be exact, they were the chickens still screaming as they were still being chased by the dalmatian pups. They chased the chickens all the way around the well and into the house. The hens then all fell into the hole in the floor, with the pups noticing as they stop running. They peeked into the floor in concern.
<br/>
Penny: Uh-oh. 
<br/>
In the music room, the chickens were still freaking out and flying around in panic. One had a bucket on its head and another was on the head of Roger. Another chicken landed on the trombone, pushing the handle down, blasting the newspaper out as it landed in front of Roger on the piano. The hen on Roger's head flew off, leaving an egg, which Roger removed from his head, chuckling a bit. Then he and Pongo finally took notice of the picture on the front page and were in shock.
<br/>
Roger: What? Patch? In London? 
<br/>
Soon, after Roger explained what's happened, he and Anita got in the car.
<br/>
Nanny: Don't you worry. I'll keep an eye on things here. 
<br/>
The dalmatian parents quickly ran for the car and hopped into the back.
<br/>
Pongo: This is all my fault. If only I hadn't lost count. 
<br/>
Roger closed the door and started the car up.
<br/>
Perdita: Oh, stop blaming yourself, dear. The important thing now is that we find him before Cruella De Vil does. 
<br/>
Nanny watched the couples drive off to find the lost pup.
<br/>
-
<br/>
Meanwhile, in the slammer, two certain crooks who worked for Cruella, in prison stripe clothing, lay on their respective bunks in misery.
<br/>
Jasper: It's not fair, Horace, me lad. It's just not fair. How come she gets off with probation and a restraining order... 
<br/>
Horace: (finishing Jasper's sentence) While we's left rottin' away in here?
<br/>
Then they saw a bobby open their cell door.
<br/>
Bobby: Off your bums, lads. Sprung for your bail, somebody has. 
<br/>
Hearing that made the brothers happy as they got out of their bunks.
<br/>
Horace: (claps hands) It must be Mum come to spring us. 
<br/>
The two then walked out of their cell.
<br/>
Jasper: Mum never liked me. It must be good ol' Dad. 
<br/>
Horace: Dad never liked you either. 
<br/>
Jasper frowned at that remark. Then, to their disappointment (and alarm), it was neither their mom nor dad, but Cruella who had entered the hall.
<br/>
Cruella: Jasper, Horace! 
<br/>
Both: (hide behind cop) Aah!
<br/>
Cruella: It's time to finish the job. 
<br/>
Horace: Oh, no, not her! We always get the worst end of it with her. 
<br/>
Jasper: Well, if she wants us to work for her this time, we won't be made fools of. 
<br/>
A bit later, in an alley, Jasper was dressed in a pink woman's dress and high heeled shoes, along with pink lipstick and a yellow woman's wig. Needless to say, he made an ugly lady. Horace, in his normal garb, made a comment about this.
<br/>
Horace: You look just like Mum. 
<br/>
Jasper: Shut up, you! (to Cruella) I ain't going through with this, I tell you! I ain't! 
<br/>
Meanwhile, Cruella was around the corner, waiting for someone.
<br/>
Cruella: Here he comes now! 
<br/>
So they shoved the man in drag out of the alley, with his wig falling off.
<br/>
Jasper: (as he's shoved) Whoa! 
<br/>
Cruella quickly flung the wig back, which landed squarely on his head.
<br/>
Horace: (motioning/quietly) Go on, Jasper. 
<br/>
Cruella: (motioning/quietly) Go! Go on! Go! 
<br/>
So the reluctant Jasper turned to the Kanine Krunchies truck passing this way, lifting up his skirt, showing his bony, hairy leg, sticking it out like a woman would. The driver saw the leg, though didn't notice how the "woman" looked completely, as he stopped the truck. He turned to the approaching "woman" with a charming smirk.
<br/>
Driver: Afternoon, love. Something I can...
<br/>
When Jasper popped up at the window with a smile, the driver saw the face and reacted with alarm and disgust.
<br/>
Driver: Aah! 
<br/>
Jasper waved a hanky as part of the act.
<br/>
Jasper: (falsetto voice) Hello, there! 
<br/>
The driver, trying to be polite in front of this "unattractive lady" stammered a bit.
<br/>
Driver: Uh, uh, something I can do for a pretty young lady like yourself? 
<br/>
Jasper: Of course you can, you naughty man! 
<br/>
"She" giggled a bit, with the driver looking more unsettled.
<br/>
Jasper: You can just (normal yet threatening voice) give me this truck! 
<br/>
He then grabbed the driver.
<br/>
Driver: (alarmed) What?!
<br/>
He tossed him out onto the pavement and in a flash, Horace and Cruella joined Jasper in the truck, driving off, with the driver flabbergasted.
<br/>
-
<br/>
That night, at the barn, all the pups lay asleep when the door was quietly opened. Horace looked inside and saw every one of the 98 puppies there.
<br/>
Horace: (gleefully/quietly) Whoo-hoo! (turns to Jasper) They're all inside, Jasper. Go ahead and start it up. 
<br/>
So Jasper crept to the truck and flipped the switch at the driver's seat, activating the jingle playing from the P.A. Nanny, who was reading the paper inside, heard the jingle.
<br/>
Nanny: Whatever in the world? 
<br/>
In the barn, Rolly's ear perked up.
<br/>
Rolly: Hmm? 
<br/>
The fat pup, though still asleep, got up, licked his muzzle and started sleepwalking outside to follow the sound of the jingle. He stepped on Spotty's head along the way.
<br/>
Spotty: Ow! 
<br/>
Both he and Fidget woke up, noticing their sibling sleepwalking towards the barn door.
<br/>
Spotty: Hey, where's he going? 
<br/>
Then they heard the jingle as well as they gasped in delight.
<br/>
Both: Kanine Krunchies!
<br/>
They got up and followed him. Soon, the rest of the pups heard the jingle, got up and followed the sound as well.
<br/>
Pup: Hey, it's Kanine Krunchies! 
<br/>
Once Rolly got outside and walked along a ramp set up, he was in stupor at the large supply of Kanine Krunchies bags, with a small pile of mentioned kibble out in the open. He stuck his tongue out in happiness before rushing into the truck to help himself. Then all the other pups rushed in, excited for the Kanine Krunchies, not seeing the trap they were walking into.
<br/>
Pups: (randomly) Oh, my! Yippee! Mmm! Yummy! Whoo-hoo.
<br/>
Horace clapped his hands quietly and hopefully, while Jasper made sneaky fingers as they walked along the plank. When all pups were in the truck, the Baduns slammed the doors shut, grinning with evil glee.
<br/>
Horace: It worked, Jasper.
<br/>
Jasper: Ha ha! Like a dream, Horace, me lad. (mimicking like he was dreaming) Like a dream. 
<br/>
Nanny's Voice: You?!
<br/>
They turned and saw a furious Nanny coming out, holding a frying pan.
<br/>
Nanny: I should have known it was you terrible men! Now let those puppies go right now or I'm going to knock the stupid out of both of you! 
<br/>
Jasper tried to calm her down.
<br/>
Jasper: Here now, lady. We don't want to have to hurt you none. So... 
<br/>
But she smacked him in the face with the pan, sending the wig onto Horace's head. Horace then saw her coming after him.
<br/>
Horace: Aaah! 
<br/>
Nanny then furiously chased him around the truck, while Jasper was in a daze, sticking his tongue out stupidly while dancing like a ballerina and holding his skirt up. Horace then came back around the corner and took his brother by the hand.
<br/>
Horace: Come on! 
<br/>
Horace screamed while running toward the pigpen, and when Jasper tripped over the fence, he landed on one of the pigs and snapped out of his daze. The pig he was on squealed in alarm as he scampered off and Jasper yelled while holding on. As Nanny entered the pen with the pan, two other pigs ran around her, making her yelp in frustration. Then she yelled as another pig scooped her up with its snout. Horace, still running, smiled upon seeing Nanny being scooped up by a pig to even bother chasing him. Of course, his happiness didn't last when he tripped on the pig troth, landing face-down in the mud and sliding in a direction and screaming. He, the pig with the yelling Jasper and the pig with the screaming Nanny all came colliding from different directions, and once they collided, the pan was sent flying up into the air. Horace moaned in pain before the pan landed on his head, hitting him and resulting in him stick his tongue out stupidly. 
<br/>
Jasper then grunted as he got his leg out of the pigs he was being squished between.
<br/>
Jasper: Right. That's it, then! (kicks one of the pigs and straightens his dress) I've had just about enough of this! 
<br/>
A bit later, Nanny was tied up and placed on the well's bucket as Jasper turned the crank to send her down into the well.
<br/>
Nanny: (in worry) Ohh! Oh, no! 
<br/>
She kept making worried noises.
<br/>
Jasper: There, now. That ought to hold you right proper. 
<br/>
Horace: Jasper. 
<br/>
Jasper: What? 
<br/>
Horace: Can we just go back to jail now? 
Later, Cruella and the Baduns (with Jasper in his normal garb and not in that hideous woman disguise) returned to Lars's warehouse. Once exiting the elevator, they came into the room, with the Baduns carrying boxes with the captured pups. Cruella spoke to the depressed Lars with a grin on her face.
<br/>
Cruella: Your muse has returned! 
<br/>
Lars: But I am a failure. You should despise me. 
<br/>
He banged his head on a stovepipe.
<br/>
Cruella: (as Jasper and Horace set the boxes down) Oh, stop being such a wet blanket and come see what I've brought for you. 
<br/>
Lars: (brightens up) A gift...(grins) For me? (grin disappears) How very "Christmas morning with the twinkle lights" of you. 
<br/>
Cruella: A gift of inspiration! 
<br/>
The artist then approached the boxes and opened one up. He took one pup and looked at him.
<br/>
Lars: Well, of course. These are only... 
<br/>
He then removed his shades and his serious look turned into a happy look.
<br/>
Lars: ...just about the most adorable little puppies... I've ever seen in my whole life! Look at these cute little darlings! 
<br/>
Cruella and the Baduns were dumbstruck at this.
<br/>
Lars: (rubs noses with the puppy) Oh, a fuzzy wuzzy little puppy poo! Poo-poo. Little puppy poo. 
<br/>
The pup licked him.
<br/>
Lars: Did you see that? 
<br/>
He laughed happily.
<br/>
Lars: Did you see that? He gave me a widdle kissy! I'm gonna kiss him back. 
<br/>
Jasper: (to Horace) He's havin' a wobbly. 
<br/>
The artist took out four more of the pups and held them closely.
<br/>
Lars: And you mean for me to do a painting of them, don't you? That's an absolutely lovely idea! It makes me smile a lot. 
<br/>
Cruella then laughed hysterically.
<br/>
Cruella: "Painting of them," he says. 
<br/>
Jasper and Horace joined in on the laughter, with Lars confused.
<br/>
Cruella: No, no, no, darling. I don't want you to make art of the puppies, I want you to make art WITH the puppies. (hugs herself) Use their coats as canvases. Create a masterpiece in a new medium. 
<br/>
The puppies looked worried while Lars looked stunned. As Cruella spoke next, she stood on the couch.
<br/>
Cruella: Together you and I will stun the art world with our ruthless originality! 
<br/>
Lars: But that means... 
<br/>
He then gasped upon realizing what she truly had in mind for them, and glared.
<br/>
Lars: How could you do such a thing to the cute little puppies?!
<br/>
Jasper: Poison them.
<br/>
Horace: Drown them. 
<br/>
Cruella: Bash them in the head. 
<br/>
Lars: I may be eccentric, but I am not a sicko! 
<br/>
Hearing that made her react with shock and anger.
<br/>
Cruella: What?
<br/>
Lars: You'll not hurt one spot on these innocent little creatures' heads! Not as long as I have anything to say about it! 
<br/>
-
<br/>
The next thing you know, Lars had his hands and feet tied in front of a painting, and was gagged. 
<br/>
Cruella: I thought you were a man of vision, someone who understood my passions, who understood the complexity that is Cruella! (grabs scalpels) Does no one get the point?!
<br/>
She then lunged the scalpels at him like darts, but fortunately for him, each one missed.
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, Lars. You're such a disappointment. Oh, well. If I can't have a masterpiece, at least I'll finally have a fabulous Dalmatian coat. That's almost as good. Don't you agree? 
<br/>
His only response was a gulp.
<br/>
-
<br/>
Later, the pups were frightened while confined in their boxes. They all whined before one of them knew what to do: start barking. The pup started barking and some of the others joined in, and that started off the Twilight Bark from before. Outside the warehouse, a woman walked her dog, and the little dog heard the barking. She yipped in response, and the woman holding onto her lead was turned around.
<br/>
Woman #1: Ooh! What has gotten into you, girl? 
<br/>
After getting the full message from the pups, the dog ran around her yelping owner, pulling the leash out of her hand before jumping onto the news stand, sending the message out. At a house a few blocks away, two kids were giving their sheepdog a bath, but then he heard the yipping and barking, Needing to understand it better, he leaped out of the tub, splashing the kids.
<br/>
Kids: Aah!
<br/>
His ear lifted up as he raced out of the bathroom, to the kids' confusion, and he raced through many rooms, causing some things to crash and topple over, and some people to shout in the process. He came to a window sill and barked the message out. The message came to another house, and a bulldog digging up a bone in the yard heard it.
<br/>
Bulldog: Kidnapped? How many? 
<br/>
His jaw dropped upon hearing the whole message. He then raced to the bars in front of his property and barked to a dachshund in a passing double-decker bus. The dachshund leaped across each yelping passenger, one by one, and got to the back, barking the message out as the bus came over a bridge. A bloodhound on top of a boat heard the barking from the bus before getting up and howling the message out.
<br/>
In a housse, a woman in curlers was talking on the phone with the window open.
<br/>
Woman #2: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. (hears howling) Wretched dogs! 
<br/>
She closed the window and the Chihuahua on her lap, who heard the message, yipped loudly into the phone. On the other end, the woman who was using the phone booth in the London park and was the one who the woman in curlers was talking to, heard the yipping and winced.
<br/>
Woman #3: Oh! 
<br/>
The yipping was also heard by two Great Danes, whose leads were being held by a man walking them. The two heard the message and started barking to foward the message, with the yelping and grunting man trying to hold them back. Pretty soon, like the previous kidnapping, the Twilight Bark had gotten out all over London and just about every dog was barking.
<br/>
-
<br/>
As the new Twilight Bark has gotten out, Thunderbolt and Patch walked down the streets, with the German Shephard tired.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I just can't understand it. We've been out here doing hero stuff all day and none of these London photographers...(sighs) seem to care. 
<br/>
Patch: Why do you want photographers around? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Aw, kid. Look, I got something to tell you. Something I guess I should have told you a long time ago. 
<br/>
Patch then heard the Twilight Bark, lifting his hear up.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, I don't know how to say this, but the truth is... 
<br/>
Patch: Thunderbolt, listen! There's an emergency! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Sounds like a kidnapping! Hmm. Being held in a warehouse. A devil woman! 101 Dalmatians. Hey, what a coincidence. You come from a family of 101, too. 
<br/>
Patch sat in horror.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: What...what's the matter, kid? 
<br/>
Patch: That is my family. Cruella must have them again. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Cruella? 
<br/>
Patch: (leaps off trash can) The devil woman! She's the one who kidnapped us before. 
<br/>
He looked sadly into a puddle.
<br/>
Patch: Oh, this is awful. What am I going to do? Wait a second...Thunderbolt! You'll help us, won't you? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Yes...well, kid, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. You see, I'm not really a... 
<br/>
Then he saw the dalmatian pup cuddling up to his paw, having faith in his hero. Thunderbolt felt this was not the best time to spill the beans, so he gave his fan a warm smile.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Of course I'll help you, Patch. Yeah! The world-famous Thunderbolt rescues the world-famous 101 Dalmatians. 
<br/>
Patch yipped happily.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ha! Sounds like a good story to me. Newsworthy even. Come on! We'll let them know I'm on my way. The villains will soon cringe in fear! Mighty Thunderbolt is here! 
<br/>
He then gave his sisgnature bark loud enough for all of the dogs of London to hear.
<br/>
-
<br/>
By Thunderbolt's trailer, two of Thunderbolt's fan girls from earlier came walking by, talking. Lightning, lying on his back in the trailer, overheard them and went over to the window to get the full scoop.
<br/>
Poodle: Oh, it's just wonderful. I heard it through the Twilight Bark. Tell all. Thunderbolt is going to save those little Dalmatian puppies. 
<br/>
Brown Dog #1: The ones that were kidnapped? 
<br/>
Poodle: That's right. 
<br/>
Brown Dog #1: Oh, isn't he just a dream? 
<br/>
Hearing all of that made Lightning gasp in horror.
<br/>
Lightning: More like a nightmare. What if "Blunderbolt" gets lucky and succeeds? If the press got wind of that...(stares at Thunderbolt standee) I- I'd never be rid of him. 
<br/>
-
<br/>
With Thunderbolt and Patch, they were snooping around the London streets, looking for the warehouse.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Look! That must be the warehouse. 
<br/>
It was indeed the same warehouse they were looking for.
<br/>
Patch: Let's try over there. 
<br/>
They ran over to a corner where a fire escape was.
<br/>
Patch: (referring to the fire escape ladder) Hey, do you think you can reach that? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: No problem. 
<br/>
Lightning: (racing to the two) Thunderbolt, old pal! 
<br/>
Patch: Lightning? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning! What are you doing here? 
<br/>
Lightning: I came as soon as I heard. Thought you might need a bit of help. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Thanks for coming, little buddy. 
<br/>
Lightning: Wouldn't miss it.
<br/>
The German Shephard leaped up to the ladder and pulled it down with his teeth. Then the three dogs used the ladder to scamper up the fire escape. Once at the top, Thunderbolt gave his daring smirk with lightning (not the dog) flashing behind him for dramatic effect. He looked around and saw no one on the roof. So he climbed to the roof, with Patch and Lightning following after. They looked through an open hole in the skylight roof and saw Horace painting a crude and childish picture of himself (as a stick figure) in front of a prison building.
<br/>
Jasper: What's that supposed to be? 
<br/>
Horace: Oh, leave us alone, Jasper. I think it's kind of pretty. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: So, what's the plan, kid? 
<br/>
Patch: See those guards? I think you can sneak past them. Remember the end of episode 39, "The Flight From the Forbidden Fort"? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: The one where I ran, jumped, and sprang? 
<br/>
Lightning rolled his eyes.
<br/>
Patch: No, no, sneaked, evaded, and triumphed. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, yeah! Of course! I get it. 
<br/>
Lightning was worried Thunderbolt would follow the pup's plan.
<br/>
Lightning: Hey, you're a pretty smart kid. That's a good plan: stealthy. But we don't need any of that. 
<br/>
Patch frowned at the sidekick dismissing his plan.
<br/>
Lightning: This is Thunderbolt! Villains always cringe in fear whenever Thunderbolt is here! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: So true. 
<br/>
Lightning: What we need is a full-frontal assault! How hard can it be? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: That's right. How hard can it be? Follow me. 
<br/>
So Thunderbolt and Patch went in first while Lightning smirked deviously.
<br/>
Lightning: Oh, I'm right behind you, pal. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt and Patch climbed down some stacked boxes and canvases quietly as Jasper looked at the painting.
<br/>
Jasper: It sort of looks like you except you don't have that much hair. 
<br/>
After Patch tumbled down the last canvas, Thunderbolt then let out his signature bark, making Jasper and Horace turn.
<br/>
Tripod: It's Patch! And he's brought Thunderbolt! 
<br/>
Jewel: He'll save us! 
<br/>
Horace: Here now. Where did you come from? 
<br/>
Jasper then took Horace's paintbrush and chucked it at Thunderbolt.
<br/>
Jasper: Get outta here, you stupid mutt! 
<br/>
The hero dog ducked the brush as it left a splat on the canvas.
<br/>
Patch: Maybe they didn't hear you. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Don't worry, kid. This will be...Take Two. 
<br/>
He let out his signature bark again.
<br/>
Jasper and Horace: Aaaah!
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (smirks) Ahh, that's more like it. 
<br/>
Of course, it wasn't he the two screamed in alarm over. Cruella stood over Thunderbolt with a paint can and held it high above his head with a lighting bolt flashing behind. Patch gasped as he saw her knock his hero out with the paint can, sending him to the floor. He ran to him to see if he was alright, while Cruella approached the pup with a greedy grin.
<br/>
Cruella: Ah! What have we here? Oh, it's you. 
<br/>
She chuckled fiendishly while Patch fearfully backed away against the wall, as Cruella slid the newspaper she kept from earlier with her foot.
<br/>
Cruella: I owe you a debt of gratitude, my photogenic little friend. (picks him up) If it wasn't for you, I'd have never found your brothers and sisters. 
<br/>
She then showed him all his siblings that she's holding prisoner.
<br/>
Cruella: And now I have you all. 
<br/>
She laughed maniacally as lightning flashed and thunder boomed. 
Then, Jasper carried Thunderbolt and stuffed him into an empty crate, with Horace throwing Patch in as well, before shutting it. 
<br/>
Patch: Thunder, are you playing dead? 
<br/>
The German Shephard awoke, making Patch smile in relief.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: That hurt. That really hurt. 
<br/>
Patch: (chuckles) I knew you were faking it. 
<br/>
Then a chuckling corgi came in.
<br/>
Lightning: He's been faking it, all right. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning, little buddy. 
<br/>
The corgi then leaped up, mad at the hero.
<br/>
Lightning: I am not your little buddy! And you are no wonder dog! This kid trusted you, and look where it's got him. 
<br/>
Patch: What's he mean? 
<br/>
Lightning then crawled around the crate while spilling the beans.
<br/>
Lightning: He's been lying to you all day, kid. He doesn't care about you or your family. He was just trying to get his name in the paper and save his job. Ask him.
<br/>
The shocked pup turned to his hero.
<br/>
Patch: Wha... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: No. Well, yeah, but...but... 
<br/>
Lightning: (mockingly) But, but, but. Hey, genius, you're no hero! You're a fraud! 
<br/>
The actor dog then hung his head in shame, with Lightning giving one evil smirk.
<br/>
Lightning: And by the way, there never was a plan to recast you. I just had to get you out of the way. 
<br/>
He then began to leave, with Patch looking sad now that he knows his hero was anything but.
<br/>
Lightning: Now I got to go take your place on the show, MY show!
<br/>
He laughed evilly while climbing up the canvases and boxes and then out of the open panel in the roof. Then it started to rain. Patch turned to the miserable Thunderbolt.
<br/>
Patch: Thunder. Thunder, I don't understand. You lied to me? 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (miserably) I put on an act. I'm an actor. (sighs) That's what I do. 
<br/>
Patch: But you said I could be your junior deputy. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I made all that up. I-I just needed someone who...who knew the script. 
<br/>
Patch: But you...you said that you'd help us. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh, don't you get it, kid? All that "running around and saving the day" stuff, it's...it's...it's make-believe. It's not real. 
<br/>
Patch: (teary) You promised! 
<br/>
He began to cry while curling up in a different corner.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Patch, I just... 
<br/>
Patch: You lied. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I'm sorry, all right? I'm not a real wonder dog. 
<br/>
Patch refused to look back at his former hero, who put his head on his paws.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: I just...acted like one once. 
<br/>
Patch just stood at the cage, shedding some tears, not only because his hero was a fraud, but also because he hasn't proven anything to make him one of a kind and because there's no way out of this for him and his siblings.
<br/>
Later, all of the 99 pups began whining in fear, and saying some sad things.
<br/>
Rolly: I'm hungry. 
<br/>
Freckle: I want to go home. It's scary here. 
<br/>
Penny: Where's mother? 
<br/>
Another puppy whine was heard before Lucky turned to Patch.
<br/>
Lucky: Patch? Are you okay? Patch? 
<br/>
Patch: (sighs) Dad was right. I am just one of 101. I'm sorry, Lucky. This is all my fault. 
<br/>
Lucky: Hey, didn't Thunderbolt get out of a cage like this once? You know, in episode 13, "The Flaming Flea Circus"? 
<br/>
Patch: Episode 18. 
<br/>
Then something struck his brain.
<br/>
Patch: Episode 18! 
<br/>
He then went to the back of the cage, concentrated on the door before rolling up to it, pressing the cage door open with his foot, without even needing a key to unlock it, and rolled out the cage, before he got up in surprise that it worked.
<br/>
Penny: Did you see what Patch just did? 
<br/>
Spotty: Wizard, Patch! Absolutely wizard! 
<br/>
The pups started barking happily, now praising him with better respect, while the sleeping Jasper in his undershirt, undies and socks on the couch heard them.
<br/>
Jasper: Hey! Shut your yapping! I'm trying to get me beauty sleep. 
<br/>
He scratched his bum while getting back to sleep. Horace, also in his undershirt, undies and socks was asleep on the chair, so Patch crept quietly to the other cages and unlocked them.
<br/>
Patch: Okay, you guys. Stick together and be quiet. 
<br/>
They crawled quietly past the Baduns with Patch looking back at Thunderbolt to see if he was coming with, but the actor dog only miserably turned away with his back on them. Patch gave a frown before he continued leading his siblings. Then he stopped behind a canvas and peeked out, seeing Cruella speaking to the still-bound Lars.
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, don't look so put-out. My favourite furrier will be open in the morning and then we'll be out of your hair. 
<br/>
Patch looked for a way past Cruella and saw the lift.
<br/>
Patch: Perfect. Episode 53, "The Mine Shaft Mix-up." (to his siblings) Everybody, stay here until I tell you it's safe to come out. 
<br/>
He scampered away to put his next part of the escape plan into action. At this time, Horace got up to have a late-night snack. He scratched his bum while heading to the fridge, looking for something to have and then he bumped his head, waking Jasper.
<br/>
Jasper: (in irritation) Aw, what is it with...(turns) Aah! 
<br/>
The reason for his scream was the sight of all the cages open and bare. Horace discovered it as well. The Baduns then pointed fingers at each other.
<br/>
Both: You let the puppies get away! 
<br/>
Jasper: Hold on! They can't have gone far. Here.
<br/>
The pups saw them coming their way as they ran off to hide.
<br/>
Jasper: Start searching. 
<br/>
Jasper looked between two canvases, even by stretching himself to fit between them, and Horace looked behind another canvas. The Baduns looked around almost every corner of every canvas. They each passed one spotty painting, not bothering to look there. Then a pack of eyes appeared on the spotty painting, that would be because it was the pups bunched together to blend in and as the Baduns weren't in front of them, they dispersed from the canvas, leaving it blank. The Baduns kept searching, unaware they were near Cruella.
<br/>
Jasper: Oh, when that crazy bird finds out we lost them again, she'll skin us. 
<br/>
Cruella's smile changed to a frown when she overheard Jasper, and turned to the two.
<br/>
Cruella: Horace, Jasper! What are you looking for? 
<br/>
The two froze, before turning to her with nervous smiles.
<br/>
Jasper: Nothing, Mum. 
<br/>
Horace: We haven't lost the doggies or anything. 
<br/>
Cruella: You let them escape? 
<br/>
They started making excuses.
<br/>
Horace: Jasper fell asleep. 
<br/>
Jasper: You were snoring like a train! 
<br/>
Then a pup's barking was coming from the lift.
<br/>
Horace: The lift is barking. 
<br/>
Cruella approached the lift, opened the doors and to her disappointment, there were no pups there.
<br/>
Cruella: The mutts must already be downstairs. 
<br/>
So the three got in as Cruella pressed the button to take themselves down.
<br/>
Horace: Funny how we never heard the lift. 
<br/>
Jasper: Shut up, you! 
<br/>
If they had stayed there longer, they would have seen Patch jump off the roof, where he was hiding to bark. He ran to his siblings.
<br/>
Patch: Come on! They'll be back soon! 
<br/>
Lucky: Aren't we going down? 
<br/>
Patch: Nope, we're going up. 
<br/>
Upon saying that, he gestured to the open window of the skylight that he, Thunderbolt and Lightning used. The pups soon got the plan as Lucky and Penny set down a canvas on its back like a trampoline and the pups were all lined up to bounce off it. Rolly was the first as he was on top of a tall cabinet.
<br/>
Patch: Ready, Rolly? 
<br/>
Rolly: Huh? (reluctantly) No, no. No, no, no, no, no, no! 
<br/>
But Patch pushed him off with his nose, as he screamed before bouncing off the canvas, out through the open window and onto the roof. He peeked back eagerly.
<br/>
Rolly: Can I do that again? 
<br/>
Patch: Okay, now the rest of you. 
<br/>
Outside, Cruella slammed the door open as she and the Baduns looked around for the pups.
<br/>
Horace: I'm just saying maybe the puppies are still upstairs...and they just tricked us into coming down here. 
<br/>
Jasper: Come on now, Horace. Dogs ain't that smart. (points to his own brain) They haven't got the big educated brains we got. 
<br/>
Back above, the pups kept bouncing off the canvas as it got down the remaining ones, including him.
<br/>
Patch: 97 away! 98 away! 
<br/>
Now he, the last one, had to bounce out as well.
<br/>
Patch: 99 away! 
<br/>
He lept off but screamed as he saw the canvas was taken away and Cruella stood there with her arms out to nab him.
<br/>
Cruella: Ah-ha-ha!
<br/>
But then Patch bounced on her face, making her yelp and back against Jasper, who ended up backing against Horace, and the three fell with a grunt while Patch ran off as fast as he could. He ran under a canvas while Jasper and Horace got up and after him.
<br/>
Jasper: Get him! 
<br/>
Patch ran to a table with some planks and paint cans of orange and blue, getting on the planks' ends, catapulting the paint cans right at the Baduns as they were in front of a blank canvas, coating them completely in paint. They then fell face down, leaving outlines of themselves on the canvas filled with splattered paint, with the outlines being the only blank parts. Patch then ran up the stacked canvases and the cupboard before bouncing off, grabbing one of the spots of the mobile Lars created earlier, spinning around.
<br/>
Patch: Who-o-o-o-a! 
<br/>
He let go at the right time, flying out the open window.
<br/>
Cruella: (growls in frustration) D'oh! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt saw this and smiled that Patch managed to get himself and his siblings out on his own, and then he saw Cruella with the Baduns, who got cleaned up and dressed, heading down the lift. Then he heard Lars still yelling in muffled distress, before looking at him. Lars lifted an eyebrow in confusion, with Thunderbolt lifting an eyebrow back.
<br/>

<br/>
Outside, once the pups made it down the fire escape, they saw the double-decker bus outside. The driver paid the owner of the news stand for a newspaper.
<br/>
Driver: Thanks, Gus. Cheers. 
<br/>
He took a read at it while Patch and his siblings came around the corner, seeing this as the perfect opportunity to escape.
<br/>
Patch: Come on. We're gonna hitch a ride. 
<br/>
So, one by one, they all snuck onto the bus, via the back door, and they got themselves seated on both deckers. Then with a door's slam, Cruella came back out, growling in anger. Patch gasped and so did Penny.
<br/>
Penny: Here they come! 
<br/>
She then accidentally knocked Spotty out of panic, causing him to lean on the brake and starting the bus. Patch and the remaining pups got on just in time as it left. The driver stood there in shock while Cruella and the Baduns spotted the bus with the dogs inside.
<br/>
Cruella: There they are! Get them! 
<br/>
Patch rushed to the driver's seat and looked at some of his siblings by the brakes.
<br/>
Patch: What's happened? 
<br/>
Fidget: She pushed me!
<br/>
Penny: Did not! 
<br/>
Patch looked and his eyes widened in horror as the bus started to head down a steep road. 
<br/>
Patch: Who-o-o-o-a! 
<br/>
All the other pups started shouting in joy and/or fear (depending on which pup is expressing those emotions in this situation) as the bus started going downhill. Jasper and Horace, trying to catch up with the bus, stopped, knowing they won't be able to catch up with it on foot. Then Cruella pulled up in the Kanine Krunchies truck, with Jasper and Horace getting in to continue the chase. Patch grunted as he tried to get control of the bus with his mouth. The pups went for a wild ride throughout the town of London. Lucky looked out the window and saw the foes gaining on them.
<br/>
Pepper: The crazy lady's right behind us! 
<br/>
The bus careened right towards a fountain, with a man sitting by it screaming as he tried to run, tripping in the water in the process, but the bus titled away from the fountain in time. Of course, when it tilted, it sent all the pups to the left side. As Patch kept driving the bus sideways, some cars spun to a halt as tires squealed. The pups ran back up to the seats on the right to get the bus back in balance. The villains were gaining on them, grinning evilly while the pups in the back seat ducked down. Horace opened up the door to make his way to the bus's back door, but then the bus and truck soon came across the Lassenger lion statues where a flock of pigeons were, and the startled birds all flew amuck. 
<br/>
Horace: (as the pigeons flew right at him) Oh-ho-ho! Ow! Ohh! Ohh! 
<br/>
Jasper quickly pulled him back in. Then something inside Horace's mouth moved around. He spat out a pigeon, who zipped away. The pups laughed at this.
<br/>
Jewel: He had a birdie in his mouth. 
<br/>
Cruella: Oh, you idiots! Here, take the wheel. 
<br/>
She opened her door and got out on top of the truck's hood. The pups gasped before Patch got on the wheel to turn it down the next road. A passing Volkswagen just happened to come out of the blue and come between the two vehicles involved in the chase.
<br/>
Cruella: Speed up, you imbeciles, or we'll lose them! 
<br/>
Jasper gritted his teeth as he put the pedal to the metal, bumping the Volkswagen in front of them and distressing the people inside it. Cruella climbed onto the Volkswagen's roof and carefully approached the upper decker, which window was open, and the pups in the back were all seeing her approaching with fear.
<br/>
Pups: Aah! 
<br/>
They all ran but Cruella's hand appeared and snatched Rolly by the tail.
<br/>
Rolly: Aaah! 
<br/>
Cruella: Ha ha! That's one! Just 98 more to go! 
At this time, at the Thunderbolt set, the episode now with Lightning as the star was being filmed.
<br/>
Producer: Okay, okay! Quiet on the set! We're rolling! And action, Wholesome Tommy! 
<br/>
The clapper was clapped as Wholesome Tommy was about to give Lightning a hug the same way he did with Thunderbolt.
<br/>
Wholesome Tommy: Aw, Lightning, you're one-of-a... 
<br/>
Then crashing was heard, making them all stop as they saw the bus crashing through the set. The cast and crew ran for their lives, but Lightning wasn't lucky to get out of the way in time.
<br/>
Lucky: Aaaaah! 
<br/>
He ended up splatting against the bus's windshield.
<br/>
Patch: Huh? 
<br/>
Cruella: Hmm? 
<br/>
She sees the bus crashing through more of the set, including the banner for auditions of yesterday, which was flung towards Cruella, blocking her sight and forcing the screaming Rolly out of her grasp. He was sent onto the hood of the Kanine Krunchies truck. Patch raced to the back, with a different pup driving, and saw Jasper and Horace trying to nab Rolly.
<br/>
Rolly: Patch, help me! 
<br/>
Patch leaped out of the back but fell right onto the top of the Volkswagen, hanging onto the edge. Cruella got the banner off her at this time. 
<br/>
Patch: Aah! 
<br/>
He saw the front bumper of the Volkswagen and back bumper of the bus hitting each other, knowing he'd be squished. Then Cruella stood over the pup menacingly.
<br/>
Cruella: Well, well. If it isn't the little half-pint hero again. 
<br/>
She laughed maniacally, swinging the banner like a rope, and in Patch's mind, that reminded him of the recent episode of Thunderbolt where Dirty Dawson swung his rope over his head, laughing maniacally. Ironically enough, Patch was in the same position as Thunderbolt. Then he got an idea similar to that episode. As he saw the other cars speeding past them, he smirked to Cruella, who was confused by the look.
<br/>
Cruella: Huh? 
<br/>
With perfect timing, he leaped onto one of the passing cars and then back onto the Volkswagen's hood, behind Cruella, surprising her. Then he grabbed the banner with his teeth and constricted Cruella with it the same way Thunderbolt tied Dirty Dawson with his whip, all the way up to her mouth. The siblings were impressed with this as well.
<br/>
Jewel: Wow! Check out Patch! 
<br/>
He then tossed the end of the banner down to Rolly, who grabbed it with his teeth. Patch then let go, letting the muffling Cruella fall into the sunroof of the Volkswagen, with the banner pulling Rolly away as Jasper and Horace missed. Then Rolly and Patch were flung back into the back of the bus. They landed safely on the back seat as Patch smiled to his brother, but then the bus hit a lamppost, bending it and started heading down an alley as Lightning held on.
<br/>
Lightning: Aaah! 
<br/>
They got closer to the end of the alley.
<br/>
Lightning and Pups: Aaaaaaaaah! 
<br/>
Patch then ran to the brake and pushed it down, slowing the bus down, with the whimpering Lightning bracing for the crash but when it got to the end, Lightning's nose barely touched the wall. Then he fainted and slid down the bus. The pups then turned around and saw the Kanine Krunchies truck, with Cruella back in it, passing the alley before coming back. The villains drove down the alley with Cruella grinning maniacally, making Patch gasp. 
<br/>
Freckles: What do we do now, Patch? 
<br/>
The panicked Patch looked around for an escape route, and then he saw some windows up above.
<br/>
Patch: See those windows? We can reach them from the upper deck! 
<br/>
The bad guys got out of the truck.
<br/>
Pongo: You go ahead. I'll hold them off...(timidly) s-somehow. 
<br/>
He then came out of the bus's back and gave out his squeaky bark at the three. Needless to say, the Baduns were amused while Cruella was less than amused.
<br/>
Jasper: (chortles) Here's a feisty one. 
<br/>
They then neared the pup as Patch tried again, and this time, a bark exactly like Thunderbolt's was heard. The foes all turned and saw Thunderbolt, daring like he was before, standing on top of the truck.
<br/>
Patch: Thunderbolt! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt turned back to the one who gave him a ride, Lars, who gave the dog a thumb's up in wishing him luck and thanks for letting him loose. Then the artist shut his car door and drove off. The German Shephard then landed right next to the pup.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: How are you doin', kid? 
<br/>
Patch: But...but I thought... 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Come on! Haven't you seen the show? I always arrive just in the nick of time. 
<br/>
Patch beamed in happiness.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Look, I may not be a real hero (winks) but I can act like one. 
<br/>
He then gave his bark at the villains once more. Lightning came crawling out from beneath the bus and he saw Jasper approaching Thunderbolt with a crooked pipe to bash the dog's head in with, and then Thunderbolt's mood changed to a mood of panic.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning, don't let 'em hurt me! 
<br/>
He then grabbed his chest and slammed against the bus's back.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Ooh, heart...Ugh! My heart! 
<br/>
This left the villains stunned as he fell to the ground, acting like he was having a heart attack.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning, this might be the end! 
<br/>
He walked around rather lamely like most dogs would do as they were about to die, as he howled and whimpered. Meanwhile, the pups took this time to sneak in through the windows. Cruella, not wanting to watch this or endure any further nonsense, took the pipe from Jasper.
<br/>
Cruella: Give me that! I'll put this mongrel out of its misery! 
<br/>
She swung for Thunderbolt, but he moved out of the way, and he did so a few more times, causing Cruella to continue missing. She then swung but hit Jasper instead.
<br/>
Jasper: Ugh! 
<br/>
As he dropped, she swung once more at the dog but hit Horace.
<br/>
Horace: (with a dizzy grin on his face) Ugh! 
<br/>
He dropped as well. As Thunderbolt kept hamming it up and dodging Cruella, Patch pushed Rolly, the last of the puppies up from of the bus's window so he could climb into the building's window. Then Thunderbolt tripped Cruella up, sending her into a trash can. Then he stood on two legs, holding his chest in pain while howling painfully and dropping to the pavement. Patch, who was watching, liked the acting Thunderbolt was doing before he rushed off. Lightning scampered over to Thunderbolt, holding him up, as the German Shephard kept feigning his death.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Lightning, I can feel the warm kiss of life...
<br/>
As he continued, Cruella stumbled around, trying to get the trash can off her.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: ...'ere it parts my cheek. 
<br/>
Cruella then crashed to the ground.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Oh! (grabs Lightning's cheeks) Do not mourn me when I am gone! It is enough that you were here at the end. 
<br/>
Lightning, buying the performance, looked very worried. Thunderbolt then gasped, standing up.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: (faintly) Goodbye...old...friend. 
<br/>
He then dropped to the ground, pretending to be dead, with his tongue sticking out. Lightning, thinking he was really dead, started bawling his eyes out.
<br/>
Lightning: (voice breaking) Good night, sweet prince. 
<br/>
He bawled his eyes out some more. Then Patch used his mouth to pull the break up, starting the bus up again as it went backwards. The pups in all the building's windows watched. Thunderbolt heard the bus as he opened an eye, got up and licked Lightning, leaving the corgi dumbstruck. Then the German Shephard leaped in the back and then he and Patch ran down the bus aisle and out of the opened front window. They turned back at the bus heading backwards, with Lightning seeing it.
<br/>
Lightning: Aaah! 
<br/>
He ran out of the way, between the legs of Cruella, who finally got the can off her, confused to see what the whimpering corgi was running from. Then she saw the bus heading to her.
<br/>
Cruella: Aah! 
<br/>
Jasper got up and saw Cruella running, as well as the bus heading for him.
<br/>
Jasper: Aaah! 
<br/>
He got Horace up and pushed him out of the way. The four bad guys, screaming and panting, ran down the alley away from the bus and tried squeezing through the narrow ways between the Kanine Krunchies truck. 
<br/>
Jasper: I got to get through here! 
<br/>
Then the bus pushed the truck, sending it backwards as the bad guys, shouting in fear and panic, kept running. Horace picked up Lightning along the way as the truck then chased them towards the bridge. The four then took a leap off the bridge and into the water, screaming. The truck crashed right through the bridge's bars and into the water as well, causing a huge splash. The truck floated for a bit but sank down as the villains coughed and flailed, trying to swim, which they could not. 
<br/>
Then a light from the heavens shined through the morning clouds, and down onto Thunderbolt and Patch, who got onto a post. Thunderbolt let out his signature bark, and Patch let out his bark but this time, it sounded more heroic with no squeaking. The two continued watching the foes struggle to swim.
<br/>

<br/>
Sometime later that morning, police cars had shown up at the area, and the bad guys were being picked up by the police. 
<br/>
Police Scanner's Voice: Dispatch to Car 47. What is your situation? Over.
<br/>
Even two police dogs carry the drenched Lightning to shore as he futiley tried protesting his way out of it.
<br/>
Lightning: No, no! Fellas, I'm not with them! I was...I was trying to help Thunderbolt! Honest! That's what I do! I'm a sidekick! We're a team! 
<br/>
But the dogs kept taking him away, passing Thunderbolt and Patch.
<br/>
Lightning: (sobbing) Come on, fellas! Come on! Don't you watch TV?
<br/>
Thunderbolt: Hmm. Now who's the pathetic ham actor?
<br/>
Lars was there, telling a cop about what Cruella did to him as the cop wrote it down in his report.
<br/>
Lars: I am painting spots, but she doesn't like them so good. And then she says, "No, you must kill them!" And I'm not so sturdy. She's very mean to me, and then I pass out. 
<br/>
At that moment, Nanny, rescued from the well, arrived in a police car as well. She got out and pointed at the dripping Baduns.
<br/>
Nanny: There they are! Those are the ones!
<br/>
Both: (pointing at Cruella) She made us do it! 
<br/>
We now see Cruella gone mental as she was now carried by two men who worked at a mental institute into the back of their truck.
<br/>
Cruella: Spots? (laughing insanely) I do see spots, you know. They're everywhere. 
<br/>
They closed the doors, driving off with their crazy patient.
<br/>
Cruella: Spots, spots, spots, spots! Spots!
<br/>
She laughed hysterically and insanely even more before the truck was out of sight. Then the car with Roger, Anita, Pongo and Perdita arrived.
<br/>
Roger: (as they all get out) There they are! 
<br/>
The puppies barked happily as their parents came to them, and the family was happy to be reunited.
<br/>
Anita: (hugs some of them) Oh, this is wonderful! They're all here! 
<br/>
As Roger had four of the pups in his arms, they all licked him as he laughed.
<br/>
Roger: Oh, come now! Oh, stop it! Stop it! 
<br/>
Perdita: (as her children nuzzled her) We were so worried about you. Penny, Lucky! Oh, my darling puppies! 
<br/>
Patch came running around and he nuzzled his parents.
<br/>
Perdita: Oh, Patch, you're safe! We were so worried about you. 
<br/>
Pongo: We missed you very much, Patch. 
<br/>
Patch: You did? 
<br/>
Pongo: Of course, son. 
<br/>
Patch felt touched that his parents did miss him. Then Thunderbolt came over.
<br/>
Patch: Mum, Dad, this is Thunderbolt. He saved us. 
<br/>
Pongo: I don't know how to thank you for saving my family. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt: No, no, don't thank me. It was your son, Patch, who... 
<br/>
Then all the excited pups talked to their mother about their recent adventure.
<br/>
Jewel: Mum, Dad, the devil woman got us! And we were trapped, and then Patch got us out! 
<br/>
Rolly: Yeah, and Patch made me a trampoline! 
<br/>
Lucky: You should have seen Patch, mother. He was fantastic! Just like Thunderbolt. 
<br/>
Thunderbolt chuckled as he spoke to Patch.
<br/>
Thunderbolt: You know, they're right, kid. Me, I'm just an actor. But you...you are a real, (pushes him with his nose) one-of-a-kind wonder dog.
<br/>
Patch giggled cutely.
<br/>
Reporter: (to the other press members) Hey, lads, they're over here! 
<br/>
Thunderbolt then scooped Patch up with his muzzle.
<br/>
Patch: Whoo! 
<br/>
He sat on top of his hero with a giggle.
<br/>
Reporter: (to the dog family) Say "spots"! 
<br/>
The picture was taken and the newspaper showed the dalmatian family and Thunderbolt, with the headlines "TV DOG AND PUP SAVE THE FAMOUS 101", and below the folds was an unhappy picture of Lightning next to the words "LIGHTNING - THE UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL". During the credits, some newspapers show the fates of the characters. One showed Lars showing off some splatter art with the outlines of Jasper and Horace, the next one shows Jasper and Horace in front of their newly-opened boutique with clothes made from man-made material, the third one shows Roger winning a music award for his latest hit "Seeing Spots", and the last one shows Cruella De Vil in a straitjacket in a mental institute, glaring angrily.

<br/>
Post-Credits Scene:
<br/>
We see Dirty Dawson laughing maniacally in a desert, sneaking behind some rocks and pointing his gun up in the air. Then Thunderbolt and Patch appear on the top of the cliff and give their barks. Dirty Dawson gulped in fear as he snuck away, but then yelped as he saw all the other Dalmatians formed a stampede. As they raced directly at him, he yelled in fear as he ran away. Thunderbolt and Patch gave each other a grin before running down to join the other pups.
<br/>
Dirty Dawson: Ya-ohhh! Ahhh-ah-ah-ah! Oh, now, come on! Down, boy! Down, all of y'all! This ain't fair!
<br/>
They all chased the bandit off into the sunset.
<br/>
"The End"
