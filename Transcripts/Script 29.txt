<b>Alvin</b>: It's going, It's going! Woah!
<b>Simon</b>: And it's gone.
<b>Alvin</b>: Whatever!  
<b>Theodore</b>: Maybe we should take a break. Ouch!
Alvin: That's it! I can't take this anymore!  I can't, I give up! I'm sick of struggling for survival! Competing with gophers and earthworms and that loser sparrow who always takes my nuts, and I'm especially sick of this stupid, stupid tree! 
<b>Simon</b>: Whoa, what's happening?
<b>Theodore</b>: Guys, I think he made it angry.

[SNORING]
[LOUD NOTE]
<b>David "Dave" Seville</b>: I'm awake! I'm up. And I'm late! Demo. Dave Seville. Keys. Bag. Pants. I need pants. Pants are essential. Claire!
<b>Claire</b>: Dave.
<b>Dave</b>: Hey. How's it goin'? I haven't seen you since, uh… Well, since you said you never wanted to see me again.
<b>Claire</b>: So I guess it worked. What a fun day that was. Let me guess. You're late for something again. Same old Dave.
<b>Dave</b>: Not following you.
<b>Claire</b>: You know, the guy who's always fooling around who can't handle a serious relationship.
<b>Dave</b>: That was the old Dave. How about we get together, talk about the new Dave?
<b>Claire</b>: I…
<b>Dave</b>: Tomorrow night, my place.
<b>Claire</b>: I…
<b>Dave</b>: Great!
<b>Claire</b>: No.
<b>Dave</b>: You look good, Claire! 
<b>Theodore</b>: Where are we?
<b>Alvin</b>: Well, I think they remodeled our forest. I like it. Stylish, yet functional—
<b>Theodore</b>: Uh, but where did the mountains go?
<b>Simon</b>: Give me a break. We're in a building, Theodore.
<b>Ian Hawke</b>: Dave!
<b>Dave</b>: Ian.
<b>Ian</b>: Hey, big guy. Hey, you ever seen the view from the 80th floor?
<b>Dave</b>: No. They never let me past the lobby.
<b>Ian</b>: What? I can't… Hey, back off, man. This is Dave Seville.
Mr. Seville, can I offer you some muffins, scones, pastries?
<b>Dave</b>: No. I'd hate to be a bother. 
It's no problem. We have an omelet station. 
<b>Dave</b>: Omelet station. 
Can I get you some water or a soy latte?
How about a shot of wheatgrass juice?
<b>Dave</b>: Maybe later. Thanks. 
<b>Ian</b>: Let's talk about your song, Dave. 
<b>Dave</b>: Well, as crazy as it sounds… the original inspiration came to me--
<b>Ian</b>: The song sucks, Dave.
<b>Dave</b>: What?
<b>Ian</b>: Your song? It's awful. I hate it. You know, I mean, who's gonna sing it? Justin, Fergie? Not a chance. I need something new, I need something fresh.
<b>Dave</b>: That is new.
<b>Ian</b>: The next big thing. Dave, we go way back, all right? And we've both come a long way since college. You? Not so much. I wanted to like that song, but you heard it. Not that good. If I wasn't your friend, I'd say: <i>Dave, you go right back</i> out of this office… …and you keep writing music. You'll get there someday. But I am your friend, so I'm going to tell you… …that there is no sense in writing songs… …that no one is ever, <i>ever</i> going to sing.
<b>Dave</b>: Ever? Excuse me. Can I get some of that water? 
We ran out. 
Hey! 
-Out of the way. -Alvin… -…slow down.
<b>Alvin</b>: Move your butt, Theodore!
<b>Theodore</b>: Ouch! You stepped on my tail!
<b>Alvin</b>: Last one to the door is roadkill!
<b>Simon</b>: I'm in!
<b>Theodore</b>: What are these shiny things?
<b>Simon</b>: Theodore, we're leaving now.
<b>Theodore</b>: Oh.
<b>Alvin</b>: Okay. This wasn't my best idea. 
<b>Simon</b>: Look out!
<b>Alvin</b>: Maniac!
<b>Simon</b>: Yikes!
Back to tree! Back to tree!
<b>Simon</b>: Back to the dog! Back to the dog!
-Basket, 3:00 -Which way is 3:00? -This way!
<b>Theodore</b>: Guys, wait for me! Wait up! I still have baby fat, you know.
-Jump, Theodore! You've gotta really want it. -I want it! -I want it! -I can't hang like this all day. Will you jump already? Ooh. Muffins.
<b>Alvin</b>: Gross. Is this his house?
<b>Simon</b>: No. It's his garbage can.
<b>Alvin</b>: Oh!
This must be where he stores his food for winter. As it came down to one-- Boa has the mouse trapped on a branch with no way out. As the boa moves in for the attack... ...the mouse seems to be facing certain death. The boa's sensitive tongue tastes the victim's presence. The mouse crashes through the foliage. Come on, baby. Come to papa! Hello, gorgeous. We've hit the mother lode. --tropical rainforest where food is bountiful.
<b>Theodore</b>: This is the greatest day of my life!
<b>Alvin</b>: Eureka! I found the cheese balls!
<b>Simon</b>: Alvin, what are you doing? Don't make a mess!
<b>Alvin</b>: Cannonball!
<b>Simon</b>: Quick. Hide! Hurry, you guys!
<b>Dave</b>: Did I put these here? Huh.

<b>Simon</b>: Hmm. He's been out for quite a while.
<b>Theodore</b>: You guys, he's dead!
<b>Alvin</b>: Don't panic! Wipe everything down. I need three garbage bags, a shovel, some disinfectant some latex gloves and oregano. Go.
<b>Simon</b>: Hang on, Sherlock. He's coming to.
<b>Dave</b>: I must be hearing things. Oh, this is trippy.
<b>Theodore</b>: Sir, are-are you all right?
<b>Dave</b>: [<i>screams</i>] Get back! Squirrels can't talk!
<b>Alvin</b>: Hey! Whoa. Wap-ap-ap-ap-oh. Watch it, genius. We're chipmunks. <i>Chip-munks</i>!
<b>Dave</b>: Chipmunks can't talk either! [<i>turns on lights</i>]
<b>Simon</b>: Well, our lips are moving and words are coming out.
<b>Dave</b>: This is not happening. [<i>closes his eyes, talking to himself</i>] I am not talking to chipmunks. I am not talking to chipmunks.
<b>Alvin</b>: So how's that working for you, Dave?
<b>Dave</b>: Uh, h-how do you know my name?
<b>Alvin</b>: I'll field that one. We read your mail. By accident.
<b>Simon</b>: You really oughta pay that utility bill, Dave. You ever heard of a credit rating?
<b>Theodore</b>: [<i>turns on the food processor</i>] What's this thing?
<b>Dave</b>: H-hey! Stop do... turn that off!
<b>Simon</b>: [<i>turns off the food processor</i>] Sorry. Uh, [<i>rubs Theodore's head</i>] he fell out of the tree at birth.
<b>Dave</b>: C-can all animals talk?
<b>Simon</b>: Uh, well, fish do have this type of sign language.
<b>Alvin</b>: Hey, Dave. Do all humans have houses that smell like sweat socks? [<i>singing while squirting soap out of the soap dispenser</i>] Dave likes to wear, dirty underwear, with little hairs...
<b>Simon</b>: We're getting off on the wrong foot. Uh, allow us to introduce ourselves. Hello. I'm Simon. The smart one. He's Alvin...
<b>Alvin</b>: The awesomest one.
<b>Theodore</b>: And I'm Theodore.
<b>Dave</b>: Oh, that's nice to meet you. Now get out of my house.
<b>Theodore</b>: But... we talk.
<b>Dave</b>: Which only makes me want you out of my house that much more. It's creepy, unnatural, somewhat evil.
<b>Alvin</b>: I kind of liked him better when he was unconscious.
[<i>Dave places a mixing bowl over the chipmunks</i>]
<b>Dave</b>: Gotcha!
<b>Alvin</b>: Hey!
<b>Dave</b>: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
<b>Simon</b>: Whoa!

<b>Alvin</b>: We love Christmas. 
<b>Simon</b>: Even though we've never actually celebrated it. 
<b>Theodore</b>: But we want to. 
<b>Dave</b>: Yeah, you can never go wrong with Christmas. 
<b>Theodore</b>: Oh, maybe we can celebrate it with you. 
<b>Dave</b>: Yeah, maybe. Look, I've had a long and weird day, so off to bed. Come on. We start work tomorrow. I want you bright-eyed and bushy-tailed by 8.

<b>Theodore</b>: Well, we colored for a while, but then we got hungry. Wanna see what we colored?
<b>Dave</b>: Actually, I wanna play you something. I wrote a song for you guys to sing, so let's--

<b>Ian</b>: What? 
Dave Seville's in the lobby. He says he won't leave without seeing you. 
<b>Ian</b>: Oh, God. That loser again? Dave! 
<b>Dave</b>: Ian. 
-Okay. 
-I've got something for you. It's your next big thing. 
-Dave. Don't say anything. What the...? Dave, don't do this to yourself, man. 
-They sing. 
-No. They don't. 
-They do. Just give me a second. Come on, guys. Want a plane that loops the loop Me, I want a Hula-Hoop 
-You know, Dave... ...some people might say it's kind of weird... ...that a grown man would want a Hula-Hoop. And others would say, <i>You know what's weirder than that?</i> A grown man bringing another grown man... ...a big box with a bunch of chipmunks in it... ...who not only speak English but can sing. 
-They do sing. We've been practicing all morning.
<b>Ian</b>: Oh, you've been practicing. I never realized. Okay, well. Yeah. Okay, no. Dave, I'm going to <i>pretend</i> that I have a lunch to go to. Oops. I've got a lunch to go to. 
<b>Dave</b>: What was that?
<b>Simon</b>: Nothing, nothing. Just a little stage fright. [<i>whimpers</i>]
<b>Theodore</b>: I thought my heart was gonna explode.
<b>Alvin</b>: We're not performing monkeys, Dave. Why do we have to sing for that guy anyway?
<b>Dave</b>: Well, how's this? Pretend I need the money and I hate my job and you're staying at my place so you owe me.
<b>Theodore</b>: We're sorry, Dave.
<b>Dave</b>: Yeah, that helps. [<i>sighs</i>] Never mind. I'm late for work.
<b>Theodore</b>: Ooh-ooh-ooh! Can we go with you?
<b>Dave</b>: What, so that you can mess that up too? Uh-uh. You're going home.
Can I stand in your lap and steer? Oh, can we at least beep the horn? Never mind. So sorry about the delay. It should be a couple more minutes. But we're building the suspense. -Here he is. -Sorry I'm late. Boy, am I jazzed about our Yum-able Energy Bars commercial. That's Good-able Energy Bar commercial. Right, Good-able. Okay, here's the pitch. We open on a group of lethargic kids. Close-up on a little girl's face. She's sad. Our customers don't like to think of their kids as being sad. Could she be flying a kite? I like kites. Good. Okay, great. She's flying a kite. She's running with a kite. She's running out of steam. She's tired and lets go of the kite. Oh, no. We see her face, it's sad. -But not too sad. -Right. So she pulls out her Good-able Energy Bar-- It's my mom. Sorry. -Hi, Mom.

<b>Simon</b>: [<i>on phone to Dave</i>] And there goes Theodore.
<b>Dave</b>: Look, I can't do this right now, okay?
<b>Simon</b>: I absolutely understand, but-- Sorry, Dave? Quick question. How do you feel about an indoor pool?
<b>Dave</b>: Look, if you flood my house, you're dead. Out on the street, <i>capiche</i>? Mothers. Why don't we come over here and look at the sales projections? You know, when I first saw these numbers, I thought there's just no way... but then I looked again.
The <i>size of Theodore's butt</i>? Why don't we come back to that? Anyway, 10 years ago, the market share for healthy food snacks... ...was imperceptible among 6 to 12-year-olds. <i>How smart Simon thinks he is</i>? Yeah, as opposed to how smart he actually is. 
-Who's Simon? -I didn't-- -Just move it along. You know what? I think I'll just clean out my office. 
-Sounds good.

<b>Simon</b>: We used them to mop up the water. Good idea, right?
<b>Dave</b>: Oh, my God, Theodore, did you just-?
<b>Theodore</b>: [<i>nervously</i>]  Umm, umm.
<b>Simon</b>: [<i>picks up a small pellet shaped this in front of Theodore</i>] It's a raisin, Dave.

[<i>Machine beeps</i>]
<b>Dave</b>: That's half an hour!
<b>Theodore</b>: Who's Claire?
<b>Simon</b>: Claire is Dave's mate. Ooh-la-la.
<b>Dave</b>: She is not my mate. She's my ex-mate. Okay. This is great.
<b>Simon</b>: Dave. Dave, relax. You just go get the food. We'll take care of the rest. All right?
<b>Dave</b>: No. Why am I having a hard time believing you?
<b>Alvin</b>: That hurts, Dave. That really hurts.
<b>Simon</b>: Yeah. We're all in this together, Dave.
<b>Theodore</b>: Like a family.
<b>Dave</b>: No. Not like a family.
<b>Alvin</b>: Tick-tock, Dave. Better bust a move.
<b>Dave</b>: Right. [<i>Alvin chuckles</i>] Wow!
We also do offices and recreational vehicles. What's that smell? It's your cologne. What did you do? Dump the entire bottle on the rug? We call it scenting the area. I gotta admit I'm surprised. The place looks great. Well, Dave, we chipmunks are notoriously tidy. Yeah, I see that. -Those bread sticks smell great. -Yeah. So when's dinner? Guys, I don't know how to tell you this... ...but it's just gonna be Claire and me tonight.

What a buzzkill, man. -I never knew you could cook this well. -It's all about slow roasting. It takes longer. But when it comes to flavor, why rush? Well, I'm impressed. -I've been seeing your photos. -Yeah, it's going really great. How about you, how's your job? Great. Loving it.
<b>Theodore</b>: How do you think it's going?
<b>Alvin</b>: Terrible. They're not even sniffing each other.

<b>Theodore</b>: And his assistant.
<b>Simon</b>: Get back here.
<b>Claire</b>: You know, this is nice. Just two friends having dinner. Hanging out. No pressure. Nothing weird.
<b>Dave</b>: Um, my-my stereo does that all the time. It's like it has a mind of its own. You were saying?
<b>Claire</b>: Oh, nothing. I was just a little nervous about coming over here. I wasn't sure if you thought this was a date or something.
<b>Dave</b>: A date? No. Um, th-the wiring in my unit is shot.
<b>Claire</b>: You should get an electrician to fix that.
<b>Dave</b>: I don't need anyone to fix anything for me.
<b>Claire</b>: [<i>chuckles</i>] Okay.

<b>Dave</b>: [<i>voice breaking</i>] Everything's fine. Why did you do that!?

<b>Dave</b>: Well, stop helping. You're ruining everything. I think I got something in my eye.
<b>Claire</b>: Here. Let me see. Yeah. It looks really irritated. It's so red. What happened?
<b>Alvin</b>: Hey!
<b>Claire</b>: What was that?

So, Dave... ...I'm sorry about that night. I really thought that you-- That I was insane? I totally understand it. Talking chipmunks. It's a lot to take in over dinner. But look at you now. You've got the career, promising future, kids. You're like a family. Don't say <i>family</i> in front of Dave. It gives him gas. -Like, clear-the-room gas. -Does not. He doesn't want a family. Why don't you guys go and play or raid the dessert table? Don't take it personally, you guys. Some people don't know a good thing when they've got it. Right, Dave? Claire. No offense, big guy, but you are not good at this. Hey, what do you think of this? -What is it? -It's Alvin. That looks nothing like Alvin. Well, yeah. It's a prototype. We'll sell a million of these things. It's voice-activated. Here, say something to it. Hello, ugly little Alvin doll that looks nothing like Alvin. -See? You love it. It's Spanish. -You know what? That's just weird. Come on, Dave, Dave, Dave. We've got to expand the Munks' fan base. I mean, forget about the music. The music is but a means to the big money, okay? I'm talking about our own fur clothing line, cologne. -I mean-- -They're just kids. No, they're rats. And they could make us both so much money... -...if you just let me work with them. -I can't hear you, the music's too loud. Don't go against me on this, Dave. I never lose. Has anyone tried the chocolate meatballs? I'll probably go into insulin shock. But it's worth it. Oh, a sweet, sweet, sweet molasses meat. Hey, alvster. Love the song, bro. -Up top. -What's up, player? So I see you're enjoying my little spread that I've put out for you guys. What am I talking about? You probably eat like this all the time. Well, Dave says he doesn't wanna spoil us. Dude, you're a rock star. You're supposed to be spoiled. I mean, you should be riding in limousines and private planes. And you should be going to parties like this every night. really? Because Dave says we need our sleep. Look, Alvin, this is hard to say but, I mean, I gotta be upfront about it. Dave's holding you back, you know. I could be making you 20 large a day. -Is that a lot? -Yes. Another thing-- I'm not gonna tell you. I will tell you. Look, behind your back, Dave Calls you... ...<i>the rats.</i> -Rats? -Yeah. Whatever, right? I know. Well, don't let it bother you. I mean, me? I consider you boys family. And if there's anything you need, anything at all... ...give your uncle Ian a call, all right? -Oh, right. -Ciao.

Here's Julianne Reynolds with today's entertainment news. Too tired to rock? The Chipmunks might be. Rumor of exhaustion and voice strain are swirling around the singing sensation. Is it because of toaster waffle overload? Or a rigorous tour schedule? It's hard to say. But manager-producer Ian Hawke has assured Fox... ...the trio will make their first stop tonight... ...on their highly anticipated world tour at the Orpheum Theatre in Los Angeles. That's it. Okay. 
You three sound like you've been gargling nails. -I'll cover for you. -Thank you. Can we get wardrobe down here, please? Well? I could give you a lot of fancy terms, but, bottom line, they're exhausted. Okay, well, give them a shot or a cream or a pill or something. I've invested every dime I have in these guys. They need a long rest. A long rest. Are you--? Okay. Yeah, a long rest, right. Right, yeah. I'm not a doctor, so.... I'll get them that rest. Thank you. I'll take care of it. Thank you so much. I will-- I appreciate it. Hey, hey, doc. Chipmunk fever, catch it. Knock, knock. So listen, guys, I just talked to the doctor. And I don't feel right about sending you guys out like this. So you're gonna cancel the show? No. No, then I'd have to give out refunds. No. What I'm talking about is having you guys lip-synch. Yeah. Isn't that like cheating? No, it's not like cheating. It's-- Cheating is wrong. This is more like helping. Yeah, all the superstars do it. Just make sure that you mouth the words exactly like we recorded them. -Otherwise, people will know. -That we're cheating. -No. -Guys, what other choice do we have? Yeah. See? That's why he's the one with the letter. All right, guys, tighten up. And remember, mouth the words and no one will know. Love you.

What's going on, Dave? What are you--? 
I gotta get my boys back but Ian's trying to keep me out.

<b>Ian</b>: But the guy just left. You shoulda said something about five seconds ago. [<i>faintly</i>] Come back. Ehh.
<b>Dave</b>: Ian, they need a real life. Not all of this. Besides, they just ruined the concert. Word'll get out, no one will come to see them.
<b>Ian</b>: Dave, they're chipmunks who talk. People will come. Sing with me. ♪ <i>Whoa-oh-whoa / That's how we roll</i> ♪
<b>Alvin</b>: You'll never take us alive!
<b>Simon</b>: They just <i>did</i> take us alive, Alvin.
<b>Alvin</b>: It's a figure of speech, Simon. Instead of criticizing me, why not use your big brain to think of a way out?
<b>Ian</b>: Go, go, go. Go!
[<i>Dave follows Ian as he is not going to lose the Chipmunks again</i>]
<b>Dave</b>: Come on.
[<i>Just then, Alvin, Simon and Theodore secretly show up in Dave's car</i>]
<b>Alvin</b>: Step on it, Dave. You're losing him.
[<i>Dave stops the car and becomes surprised that Alvin, Simon and Theodore have escaped</i>]
<b>Dave</b>: How did you guys...?
<b>Simon</b>: We are talking chipmunks, Dave. We can get out of a cat carrier. Not even hard to do.
<b>Theodore</b>: You came back for us.
<b>Dave</b>: Well, of course I came back. We're a family.
[<i>The Chipmunks gasp</i>]
<b>Simon</b>: Holy nuts.
<b>Alvin</b>: What? Am I going crazy? Or did he just say "family"?
<b>Dave</b>: I know, but I really missed you guys.
<b>Theodore</b>: I missed you too, Dave.
<b>Simon</b>: Me too. So did Alvin. He's too cool to admit it. Yeah, too macho.
<b>Alvin</b>: *coughs* Missed you too. Sorry, I had some sentimentality stuck in my throat. I just said, I missed you too.
<b>Dave</b>: Whatever. Who are you guys to judge me?
<b>Alvin</b>: Okay, you know what? I miss my friend Dave, okay? I'll scream it from the rooftops. And I'm not afraid. I'm not ashamed. That's right. I love you, Dave.
<b>Dave</b>: Come here.
[<i>Alvin comes up to Dave and the Chipmunks hug Dave as the family is finally back together again</i>]
<b>Alvin</b>: Dave?
<b>Dave</b>: Yes, Alvin?
<b>Alvin</b>: Now can I steer?
<b>Theodore</b>: Oh, please, please, please.
<b>Simon</b>: I want to work the windshield wipers.
<b>Alvin</b>: Oh, and I'd like to beep the horn.
<b>Dave</b>: Have at it, fellas.
[<i>The Chipmunks take control of the wheel as the four head home</i>]
<b>Theodore</b>: I'm a good beeper.
<b>Simon</b>: Save some horn for the rest of us.
<b>Alvin</b>: Come on, Dave, drive faster.
<b>Simon</b>: Not with you steering.
<b>Alvin</b>: Dave, you drive like a sleepy old bear.
<b>Dave</b>: Okay, Alvin, that's enough.
<b>Alvin</b>: Enough of what? Of being awesome?
<b>Dave</b>: Alvin, I said that's enough.
<b>Alvin</b>: Hey, look, Dave, no paws. Whoo-hoo!
<b>Ian</b>: Hey, if you guys behave, maybe I'll let you call me <i>uncle Ian</i> again. Deal?
<b>Theodore Doll</b>: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
<b>Simon Doll</b>: Bonjour! Je m'appelle Simon.
<b>Alvin Doll</b>: <i>Hola. Me llamo Alvin. Yo quiero una Hula Hoop.</i>
<b>Ian</b>: ¡Madre de Dios! NOOOOOOOOO!
<b>Dave</b>: [<i>doorbell rings</i>] Claire.
<b>Claire</b>: Hey.
<b>Dave</b>: Come on in.
<b>Alvin</b>: Well, hello, Clarina.
<b>Claire</b>: Hi, guys.
<b>Dave</b>: I hope you like toaster waffles.
<b>Alvin</b>: And, for us classy chipmunks, a bit of the bubbly.
<b>Claire</b>: Ohhh.
<b>Alvin</b>: [<i>trying to uncork a bottle</i>] Stupid... cork... doesn't...
[<i>The cork comes loose and goes flying</i>]
<b>Alvin</b>: Whoa! [<i>the cork smashes glass on a china cabinet</i>]
<b>Claire</b>: Oh!
<b>Alvin</b>: Yikes! [<i>giggles nervously</i>] Oops.
<b>Dave</b>: Not gonna say it.
<b>Alvin</b>: Uh-oh.
<b>Simon</b>: Good grief.
[<i>Champagne pours all over the floor</i>]
<b>Claire</b>: Still not gonna say it?
<b>Dave</b>: Nope. [<i>Champagne reaches power strip; electricity buzzes; smoke issues from power strip, causing a blackout in the house]</i> I'm gonna say it. <b>Alvin!!!</b>
<b>Alvin</b>: <i><b>Okay!</b></i>
<b>Ian</b>: Okay, guys, come on, let's try it again. Here we go, and sing. Come on, sing for your uncle Ian. Come on, sing. Why--? Why won't you sing? You know, I said, sing. Sing.
