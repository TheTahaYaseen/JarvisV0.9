Seventh-grader.
<br/>
Sounds a lot better
than sixth-grader.
<br/>
(SlGHS) This is a Greg thing.
l don't see why l had to come.
<br/>
Because, Rodrick,
this is a family event,
<br/>
and like it or not,
you're part of
the Heffley family.
<br/>
Yeah.
That and we already
paid for your ticket.
<br/>

Do you want

Only if the trick
is to make

<br/>
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

Hey, guys!
Anyone for pizza?

Hey! Thanks, Fregley.

It's magic

You know
<br/>
Who is that?
<br/>
Her name is Holly Hills.
She just moved here.
<br/>
What grade is she in?
Seventh.
<br/>
She's an all-star

<br/>
has done
professional modeling,

<br/>
She moved here from Oregon
because her father
got a big promotion.
<br/>
They drive a hybrid SUV,
<br/>

in a cul-de-sac near the park.
<br/>
What? l googled her!
<br/>
She's a picture

<br/>
She's almost as
pretty as my mom.
<br/>
She's going to be
very popular.

We have no idea

<br/>
Okay! Well,
l think l'm going
to go skating now.
<br/>
Please
congratulate your father
on his promotion from me!
<br/>
"We know exactly who you are"?
You trying to scare her?
<br/>
Does it really matter?
<br/>
A girl like that is
out of your league
anyway, Gregory.
<br/>
She's new.
She isn't out of
anyone's league yet.
<br/>
She doesn't know
the social pecking order.

a time for me
to make a move,
<br/>
it's now.

(RODRlCK SCOFFS)

Can you break
a leg or something
so we can leave?
<br/>
(SlGHS)
<br/>
RODRlCK: Oh ! (LAUGHS)
<br/>
That'll never happen.
Not a chance.
<br/>
There's no way
that girl will
ever talk to you.
<br/>
Yeah, well,
l just talked to her
<br/>
and we'll probably
skate later.
<br/>
Really? Okay.
<br/>
Well, you see
that clock?
<br/>
They play a slow song
at the top of every hour
for couples skate.
<br/>
lf you're so confident,
ask her to skate.
<br/>
Maybe l will.
<br/>
What you waiting
for, wimp?
<br/>
You the man !
<br/>
(LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
Look, if we can
get out to Holly
<br/>
and be standing
right next to her
when the clock changes,

then l can ask her to skate
and she'll have to say yes.

GREG: Rodrick!
(BABY CRYlNG)

Here, catch !
<br/>
Let me start by saying
that having a brother
is really overrated.
<br/>
Rowley always says
he wishes he had
a brother,
<br/>
and, boy, do l wish
l could give him
one of mine.
<br/>
l've looked into it
and, unfortunately,
it's not legal,
<br/>
l mean,
Manny has been
telling on me
<br/>
ever since he was
able to speak.
<br/>
Bubby did it.
<br/>
(CAT GROWLS)
<br/>
Bubby did it.
<br/>
SUSAN: Greg !
<br/>
And Rodrick is
the king of laziness.
<br/>
Except when it comes
to torturing me.
<br/>
(COUGHlNG)
(LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
GREG: My mom has
started writing
<br/>
an advice column
for the local paper.
<br/>
She wrote an article
last week
<br/>
about how your brothers
will always be there for you.
<br/>
Well, that's exactly
what l'm afraid of.
<br/>
(BOWL DROPS)
<br/>
Hey, Bubby.
<br/>
Got to go, Mom.
Later, Mom.
<br/>
Yeah, see you, hon.
Okay, okay, wait.
<br/>
Hold on.
Wait a second.
<br/>
l need a moment
for a family meeting.
<br/>
Now, your father and l
have been talking.
<br/>
Things between you two
have really gotten
out of hand.
<br/>
Can l just say. . .
<br/>
You may not
realize it now,
<br/>
but having a brother is
one of the most important
relationships of your life.
<br/>
l mean, one day
you're gonna be
Uncle Greg
<br/>
and Uncle Rodrick
to each other's kids.
<br/>
That's important.
So you need to get
to know each other.
<br/>
What?
What?
<br/>
You need to spend
more time together.
What?
<br/>
So that's why l've come up
with a new program
<br/>
that's going to reward you
for spending time together.
<br/>
l'm calling it
(lMlTATES FANFARE)
<br/>
"Mom Bucks."
<br/>
You're paying us
with fake money?
Yeah.
<br/>
Okay, now, for every hour
that you spend together
without fighting,
<br/>
for example, let's say
you give Greg
a drum lesson,
<br/>
you each earn
a Mom Buck,
<br/>
which you can
then trade in
for one real dollar.
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
So, to start you off,
l'm giving you
each five Mom Bucks.
<br/>
Now, if you're smart,
you'll save up
your Mom Bucks. . .
<br/>
Can l cash out now?
<br/>
Well, Rodrick,
if you save. . .
<br/>
But can l cash out?
<br/>
Yes, but. . .
<br/>
l want to cash out.
<br/>
Frank?
l know.
<br/>
(EXHALES)
<br/>
Uh. . . Okay.
Yes, you can.
All right.
<br/>
Okay. All right, great.
We should get going,
<br/>
because you don't want
to be late for school.
All right?
<br/>
Yeah, gotta go.
Let's go.
Okay, all right.
<br/>
This Mom Bucks thing
is a gold mine, muchacho.
<br/>
You better not
ruin it for me.
<br/>
GREG: Most kids hate it
when summer ends,
<br/>
but I have to say, right now,
school is starting to look
pretty good.
<br/>
Welcome back.
<br/>
lt's nice not to be
the new kids this year.
<br/>
l agree.
<br/>
l know. Look at all
the tiny sixth-graders.
<br/>
l'm so glad that's
not me this year.
<br/>
Just a little higher.
Just a little higher.
<br/>
Whoa! Greg !
Look who's in our class.
<br/>
GREG: This was my chance.
If I could sit next to Holly,
<br/>
I'd have the whole year
to show her how great I am.
<br/>
No way, Greg Heffley.
<br/>
This is my seat.
<br/>
No, it's not.
l was here first.
<br/>
PATTY: (GRUNTlNG)
lt's mine!
<br/>
Let go!
<br/>
You know
l'm stronger than you,
Greg Heffley.
<br/>
Don't make me
beat you up again !
<br/>
Let's get
something straight.
<br/>
l was sick that day
and l had something
in my eye.
<br/>
MR. DRAYBlCK: Well !
<br/>
l've never had
students so eager to
start the school year.
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
This is my seat!
This is my seat!
<br/>
(LAUGHS) Okay,
let's start again.
What are your names?
<br/>

<br/>
Greg Heffley.
<br/>
Would you be related
to Rodrick Heffley?
<br/>
(EXHALES)
<br/>
l've got my eye
on you, Heffley.
<br/>
GREG:
There's no way to escape.
<br/>
(RODRlCK LAUGHS EVlLLY)
<br/>
lt's unbelievable!
Even at school,
Rodrick is ruining my life.
<br/>
Shh !

<br/>
Nah. Watch.
<br/>

<br/>
Do you have an amazing talent
that you'd like to share?

Hey! Greg !
Maybe we should. . .
<br/>
Can it,

<br/>
Westmore is absolutely
packed to the roof

<br/>
The top prize is $1 ,000
and, of course,
<br/>
the admiration
of your friends
and neighbors.
<br/>
This is huge.
l gotta call the band.
We gotta practice.
<br/>
This is gonna be
our big break!
<br/>
Uh-uh-uh.
Wait a second.
<br/>
Aren't you forgetting
something?
What?
<br/>
l showered yesterday.
Smell.
<br/>
Okay, okay.
Okay. Okay.
<br/>
We agreed
that you'd give
a drum lesson to Greg.
<br/>
You were serious?
<br/>
SUSAN: Who knows?
<br/>
Maybe you guys
will really like it
<br/>
and we can
form a family band.

(ROCK SONG PLAYlNG)
<br/>
GREG: Rodrick says
he's a professional musician,
<br/>
but as far as I know
the only money he's made,
<br/>
is when Dad gave him
five bucks once
to stop playing.
<br/>
When do we get to
play the real drums?
<br/>
Like l'd ever
let you touch them !
<br/>
Watch and learn,

<br/>
Hey, l was thinking
we should enter
the talent show.
<br/>
l could do my magic act
and you could be
my assistant.
<br/>
Assistant? No way.
<br/>
Doing magic tricks
is bad enough.
<br/>
Assisting the guy
doing the tricks?
<br/>
l'd never make it
to eighth grade.
<br/>
(BEEPS)
<br/>
What?
<br/>
Hey, a cookie.
<br/>
Manny,
what have you done?
<br/>
l'm only three.
<br/>
What's going on?
What did you do to him?
<br/>
Nothing !
He ruined my video game.
<br/>
Oh ! He didn't do
anything on purpose.
Did you, honey?
<br/>
No, l didn't.
No, he didn't.
He's only three.
<br/>
MANNY: l'm only three!
<br/>
Okay, let's go, sweetie.
You want another cookie?
<br/>
GREG: It's so unfair.
<br/>
I have Rodrick
making my life a misery
on one side,
<br/>
and Manny attacking me
from the other.
<br/>
And I'm the only one
who seems to get
blamed for anything.
<br/>
I wonder what it'd be like
to have a family
that actually loves me.
<br/>
Little boy!
<br/>
We're a very rich couple
with no children
and so much love to share.
<br/>
Won't you come be
part of our family?
<br/>
Finally!
Someone l can
leave my billions to.

<br/>
lndia? Why would
you go there?
<br/>
lndia is fascinating.
lt's the jewel of

My father has business
to take care of,
<br/>
so he's taking
the whole family.

Wow. Holly Hills

And he's an all-star!
<br/>
Well, l'm sure
your soccer skills
<br/>

<br/>
Go strike while
the iron is hot.
<br/>
You'll see.
<br/>
When you come back
from lndia,
<br/>
she'll be
hanging out with me.
<br/>
CHlRAG:
l would love for that
to be true, Gregory.
<br/>
lt would provide hope
for smaller boys
everywhere,
<br/>
but girls like that
just don't hang out
with guys like us.
<br/>
So, listen, you don't
have to worry about being
in my magic show anymore,

<br/>
What's this?
<br/>
lt's a gift from Manny.
<br/>
He made it for you
because he wanted
to say he was sorry
<br/>
for breaking
your video game.
lsn't that cute?
<br/>
lt looks dangerous.
What if l sat
on that thing?
<br/>
Greg !
What are you doing?
<br/>
(SOFTLY) Tell Manny
you love his gift.
<br/>
You're so lucky
you don't have
any brothers.
<br/>
You're kind of
like my brother.
<br/>
And shouldn't we
be looking up things

She's famous,

<br/>
Oh.

Now, do it again.

Rodrick tells me that you're

<br/>
So that means
that you earn enough

<br/>
Oh, yeah ! Yeah.
<br/>
Well, enough if you live

lt doesn't sound

No.
<br/>
Why don't you
tell Rodrick?
<br/>
Give him a picture
of just how challenging
it can really be.
<br/>
No, it's really hard.
<br/>
First of all,
there's no home-cooked
meals like this.
<br/>
What? Really?
<br/>
Yeah, yeah !
No, on the road,
it's all
<br/>
burgers and fries
and pizza.
<br/>
Then you got to
deal with the fans,
especially the girls.
<br/>
No, it's definitely
not for everyone.
<br/>
But. . .
<br/>
lf you like rocking
deep into the night
and partying hard all day
<br/>
then it might be
the life for you.
lt's definitely for me.
<br/>
ROWLEY:
lt does sound fun.
<br/>
But what if
you don't play

<br/>
Löded Diper

<br/>
(SHRlLL SCREAM)
<br/>
(GROANS)
<br/>
You know, you really need
to cut your toenails.
<br/>
What was that?
<br/>
(SCREAMS)
<br/>
Turn it off!
Turn it off!
<br/>
GREG: Okay. Only
'cause you're scared.
<br/>
(BOTH PANTlNG)
<br/>
Let's just go to sleep.
<br/>
ROWLEY:
l wish we had watched
Andy's Magic Cushion.
<br/>
l love this movie, Frank.
Don't you just
love this movie?
<br/>
He picked the housekeeper
over the supermodel?
<br/>
(SNlCKERlNG)
<br/>
l know.
<br/>
(ROWLEY SCREAMlNG)
<br/>
lt's got me!
The foot has got me!
<br/>
(BOTH SCREAMlNG)
<br/>
Greg, is there something
you want to say to
Rowley and his father?
<br/>
l'm sorry for choosing
an inappropriate movie
for the sleepover.
<br/>
At least nobody
got hurt this time.
<br/>
l'm a little birdy.
l'm a little birdy!
<br/>
(CRASHlNG)
<br/>
(GRUNTlNG)
My knee bone.
<br/>
What?
<br/>
Mommy, look.
<br/>
Mommy is looking.
Mommy's looked
a thousand times!
<br/>
Mommy just needs
to go to the potty
for one minute, okay?
<br/>
No! No!
<br/>
SUSAN: What the heck?
Where's the lock?
<br/>
Wait.
<br/>
SUSAN:
Rodrick, could you
come here, please?
<br/>
What happened
to the lock?
<br/>
l don't know what
you're talking about.
<br/>
There was a lock
on this door.
<br/>
Um. . . (LAUGHS)
<br/>
l don't think so.
<br/>
Rodrick,
l've lived in this house
for 1 0 years.
<br/>
l've locked that door
1 0,000 times
<br/>
because sometimes
it's my only moment
of privacy of the day.
<br/>
l know there was
a lock on that door.
<br/>
There wasn't.
Trust me.
<br/>
Greg has walked in
on me a million times.
<br/>
And if there was a lock,
l would use it.
<br/>
ln fact, maybe
you should put one on.
<br/>
So that's your story.
<br/>
There was never a lock
and you have no idea
what l'm talking about.
<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
Fine. l'll just
go ask your brother
the same thing.
<br/>
(WHlMPERS)
<br/>
Greg? Two words.
<br/>
Bathroom door.
<br/>
lt was Rodrick!
He made me!
lt was his idea.
<br/>
He had the party!
Someone wrote on the door,
so we had to change it!
<br/>
l knew it. l knew it.
<br/>
No, Mom, wait!
l was exaggerating
a little bit.
<br/>
lt wasn't a party.
lt was a band rehearsal
<br/>
for the talent show.
That's all it was.
<br/>
We said nobody
could come over.
He knew the rules.
<br/>
Yeah, but, Mom,
if you punish him,
<br/>
Rodrick's gonna know
l told on him.
<br/>
We really had
a good time this weekend.
But if you do this,
<br/>
Rodrick and l will never,
ever be friends again.
<br/>
The idea that one day
my kids won't get to know
their Uncle Rodrick?
<br/>
Or have any
family holidays?
<br/>
You two really
have been getting along
better this week, haven't you?
<br/>
Yeah. We really have.
<br/>
(SlGHS)
<br/>
(EXCLAlMS)
<br/>
Okay, if. . .
<br/>
lf l let this slide,
<br/>
and be our little secret
for the sake of the family,
<br/>
and for your relationship
with your brother,
<br/>
do you swear to be
on your best behavior
and get along?
<br/>
l swear. l swear.
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
(SlGHS lN RELlEF)
<br/>
You didn't buckle.
<br/>
Deny, deny,
deny, right?
<br/>
You know. . .
<br/>
You may not be half as lame
as l thought you were.
<br/>
GREG:
I couldn't believe it!
<br/>
Rodrick was actually
trying to be nice to me.
<br/>
Wow!
You're a Mom Bucks
millionaire!
<br/>
Where'd you get these?
Thrift shops.
<br/>
There's enough in here
to last me until l'm 30.
<br/>
(GROANS)
<br/>
lt's about time, little bro,
that you learn the secrets
to an easy life.
<br/>
Rule number one,
<br/>
don't be good at something
you don't want to do.
<br/>
Guys!
Use clean rags, not. . .
<br/>
Just give me that!
l'll do it myself.
<br/>
Rule number two,
always lower Mom
and Dad's expectations.
<br/>
Hey, l took
a math test today
<br/>
and l'm pretty sure
l flunked it.
<br/>
Oh, Greg !
<br/>
But l got it back,
and look!
<br/>
l got a C minus.
<br/>
Well, at least
you didn't fail.
<br/>
Rule number three,
never do something
<br/>
when someone else
can do it for you.
<br/>
(EXCLAlMS)
<br/>
"1 00 Years Ago."
l remember that
assignment.
<br/>
Why write a new one
<br/>
when there's
a perfectly good paper
<br/>
already written
by your brother?
<br/>
lsn't that cheating?
<br/>
lsn't Mr. Draybick
cheating
<br/>
by handing out
the same assignment
every year?
<br/>
New binder.
Teachers dig binders.
<br/>
GREG: The thing was,
<br/>
Rodrick had managed
to get my dad to do
<br/>
all his homework
for the past five years.
<br/>
Which one's
the space bar again?
<br/>
Just let me do it,
okay? Okay.
<br/>
I would never actually
hand in a paper
Rodrick wrote.
<br/>
But my dad?
That's a different story.
<br/>
So that's just
three of the things
Rodrick has taught me.
<br/>
He has a lot
of cool tips.
<br/>
l'm not sure Rodrick's tips
are really that cool.
<br/>
Okay, so the
invisible Chirag joke
is still going,
<br/>
and the whole school
is in on it.
<br/>
But it looks like Chirag's
discovered our weakness.
<br/>
Hello, Greg, Rowley.
<br/>
Still pretending
l'm invisible,
l presume.
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
l don't know
if l can do this.
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
Stay strong.
<br/>
What is this?
A corn dog.
<br/>
Rowley's all-time
favorite lunch delicacy.
<br/>
lf you say you
can see me, Rowley,
it is all yours.
<br/>
Mmm. Smell that
buttermilk batter.
<br/>
GlRL 1 :
You got him, Chirag.
(ROWLEY GRUNTlNG)
<br/>
GlRL 1 : Resist it.
<br/>
GlRL 2:
Don't do it, Rowley.
<br/>
Hey, everyone, look!
There's a floating
corn dog.
<br/>
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
I don't want to
get ahead of myself
or anything,
<br/>
but I think I may have
Class Clown in the bag
for dreaming this one up.
<br/>
(HONKlNG)
<br/>
ln conclusion,
without last century's
technological advances,
<br/>
there would be no computers,
cell phones,
or modern medical miracles.
<br/>
And so for that,
we salute and thank
our ancestors
<br/>
from 1 00 years ago.
<br/>
Thank you, Holly.
That was excellent work.
<br/>
l think we have time
for one more.
<br/>
l have to say that
when l read this paper
<br/>
l was a bit surprised
by its content.
<br/>
But more than any other,
this one deserves
to be read out loud.
<br/>
Greg?
<br/>
Yay, Greg !
<br/>
Just read it, Greg.
All of it.
<br/>
GREG: Okay.
<br/>
"Sometimes l sit and wonder
about stuff l do not know
<br/>
"Like what the Earth
was like 1 00 years ago
<br/>
"Did cavemen
ride on dinosaurs?
Did flowers even grow?
<br/>
"Did spiders rule the Earth?
Were deserts filled with snow?
<br/>
"There were no
books or humans, so
How were we to know
<br/>
"What life was
like 1 00 years ago?"
<br/>
Loser.
<br/>
Now, Greg, when we talk
about how important
it is to recycle,
<br/>
we don't mean turning in
your brother's old papers.
<br/>
l thought Dad helped
you with this paper.
<br/>
Well, actually,
<br/>
Dad started
writing my papers
because of that paper.
<br/>
l looked like an idiot!
<br/>
And the girl
from the roller rink?
She laughed at me.
<br/>
Ouch !
<br/>
Just do something
that changes
her opinion of you.
<br/>
Like, set a firecracker
off in the classroom.
Boom !
<br/>
Chicks dig bad boys.
<br/>
Well, actually
l was thinking about
writing her a note.
<br/>
You mean like one
with words on it?
<br/>
l've got it
all figured out.
<br/>
I'm gonna pass her a note
with a question on it,
but it'll be anonymous.
<br/>
She'll be like,
"I have to know
who wrote this."
<br/>
Then later,
I'll walk up to her
<br/>
and ask her
the exact same question.
<br/>
It'll blow her mind.
<br/>
(WHlSPERS) A note?
<br/>
Do you want me
to spell check it?
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
Just pass it to Holly.
<br/>
To Holly.
<br/>
(SlGHS)
<br/>
(MOUTHlNG)
Thank you.
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
lt's from Greg.
<br/>
What's going on?
<br/>
Greg Heffley is
passing me notes!
<br/>
No, l wasn't.
<br/>
"How do you get your hair
to smell so beautiful?"
<br/>
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
(SNlFFS)
<br/>
GREG: Okay.
The note was
a minor setback,
<br/>
but at least things
are still going well
with Rodrick.
<br/>
It's amazing but
I'm actually enjoying
<br/>
watching Löded Diper rehearse
for the talent show.
<br/>
Bill's taken the band
to a whole new level.
<br/>
(ECHOlNG)
Somebody farted.
<br/>
l got one. l got one.
l got a good one.
l got a good one.
<br/>
(ECHOlNG)
Somebody farted.
<br/>
My dad should be happy
that I'm hanging out
with Rodrick.
<br/>
But I don't think
he really likes Bill.
<br/>
I think
what he's worried about is
l'll turn out like Rodrick,
<br/>
Manny'll turn out like me,
and, eventually,
we'll all turn out like Bill.
<br/>
Rock and roll !
<br/>
Rock on.
Yeah.
<br/>
HOLLY: Dear Greg,
meet me in the art room
before lunch.
<br/>
There's something
I want to ask you.
Kiss, kiss. Holly.
<br/>
Hi, Holly!
l was glad to
get your note.
<br/>
l've been wanting
a chance to talk to you.
<br/>
And, hey, you like to paint.
l'm kind of an artist myself.
<br/>
Holly?
<br/>
Ha!
<br/>
(GASPS) Chirag?
<br/>
You see me now, don't you?
Game, set and match
to Chirag Gupta!
<br/>
(PANTlNG)
<br/>
Hi, Holly.
Hi, Fregley.
<br/>
She thinks
l'm Fregley?
<br/>
That's got to hurt.
<br/>
(SlGHS)
<br/>
(CHATTERlNG)
<br/>
Want to see
my secret freckle?
<br/>
BOTH: Ew!
<br/>
(LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
So the note to the girl
didn't work out?
<br/>
All right. Let's go.
Little bro,
l am taking you out.
<br/>
And here are
my other men.
<br/>
Greg, Rodrick,
l'd like you to
meet my editors,
<br/>
Mr. Salz and Mrs. Kohan.
<br/>
Hey. Hello.
Nice to meet you.
Hello.
<br/>
Where you boys off to?
<br/>
Just taking
the little brother out
<br/>
for the evening.
He could use a good time.
<br/>
Okay, well, be safe.
And be home by 9:00.
<br/>
Yeah. See you !
<br/>
Bye.
Bye. Have fun !
<br/>
Good night.
<br/>
Now that is impressive.
<br/>
My older boy
wants nothing to do
with his younger brothers.
<br/>
MRS. KOHAN: You certainly
practice what you preach.
<br/>
l think every mother in town
should read your column.
<br/>
Thanks.
<br/>
Mom would kill us
if she saw us eating this.
<br/>
(BOTH MOANlNG)
<br/>
(SLURPlNG)
<br/>
(GROANlNG)
<br/>
Brain freeze!
Brain freeze!
<br/>
All l can say is,
get ready to have
your mind blown.
<br/>
We are going to
have an epic night.
<br/>
(GROANlNG)
<br/>
Are you okay?
<br/>
(RETCHlNG)
<br/>
(LAUGHS) Fake vomit.
You can't beat
the classics.
<br/>
Yeah.
<br/>
Here we go.
Here we go.
Here he comes.
<br/>
(SCREAMS)
<br/>
(PANTlNG)
<br/>
Okay. Very funny!
Very funny.
<br/>
GREG: This is sweet!
<br/>
l told you.
<br/>
(EXCLAlMS lN DlSGUST)
<br/>
(SCREAMS)
<br/>
So, you know that girl
who l sent the note to?
<br/>
Yeah?
<br/>
She thinks l'm Fregley.
<br/>
(LAUGHlNG) Oh, man !
<br/>
l mean, hey,
don't take it hard.
<br/>
Girls act like
they're not into you
when they really are.
<br/>
l mean, tons of girls
act like they're not
into me, but they are.
<br/>
l know they are.
l bet she really
likes you.
<br/>
(FOOTSTEPS)
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
Check it out.
Check it out.
<br/>
Whoa!
<br/>
(RODRlCK LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
Who's out there?
<br/>
No way.
<br/>
Coach Malone?
<br/>
Real funny, yeah?
Oh, yeah !
<br/>
Well, you just messed
with the wrong athlete!
<br/>
Move. Move!
<br/>
MALONE: Show yourself!
Go, go!
<br/>
You want to take me on? Yeah?
You want to take me on?
<br/>
You better bring your A game,
'cause l am a competitor!
<br/>
Come on !
MALONE:
You will come out!
<br/>
You know l'm going
to find you !
<br/>
Help!
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
Something tickles.
<br/>
(SCREAMlNG)
<br/>
RODRlCK: Come on.
Come on. Come on.
<br/>
(YELLS)
<br/>
(GREG WHlMPERlNG)
<br/>

You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!
<br/>
RODRlCK:
Go, go, go, go!
<br/>
MALONE:
Everywhere you go,
it's me!
<br/>
(RODRlCK SHRlEKS)
(MALONE GRUNTlNG)
<br/>
Stupid carbs!
<br/>
There's the mall !
Come on.
<br/>
l can't go
much further!
<br/>
(GREG PANTlNG)
<br/>
(PANTlNG)
<br/>
(GROWLS)
<br/>
Got you !
<br/>
(PEOPLE MURMURlNG)
<br/>
WOMAN: Coach Malone?
<br/>
"You can't outrun me!
l'm a superstar!"
<br/>
"Everywhere you go,
it's me!"
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
Oh, you boys
are five minutes early.
Did you have a good time?
<br/>
A great time.
<br/>
That is so sweet.
<br/>
l just can't
get over how well
your boys get along.
<br/>
Well, Larry,
we run a pretty tight ship
around here.
<br/>
lt's all about
boundaries, rules.
<br/>
Anyway,
let me show you some of those
Civil War re-enactment photos
<br/>
l was telling you about.
<br/>
So, what did
you boys do?
<br/>
(STUTTERS)
Just hung out
at the mall.
<br/>
And talked about life.
Nothing special.
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
Rodrick?
<br/>
Can you explain
what you're doing
in this photo?
<br/>
That's not me.
<br/>
That's not you?
<br/>
Nope.
<br/>
Okay. How about these?
<br/>
l can't believe
that you had a party!
<br/>
Greg, you told me
it was a couple of kids,
a band rehearsal !
<br/>
Wait, Susan,
you knew about this?
<br/>
SUSAN: Yes.
<br/>
Yes, l knew.
<br/>
You told Mom?
<br/>
l knew they
had a party!
<br/>
lt slipped out,
but l took it back!
<br/>
My instincts told me
you weren't being honest!
<br/>
l should've
trusted my instincts.
FRANK: Wait!
<br/>
You knew about this,
but you didn't
tell me about it?
<br/>
l still protected you !
<br/>
l threw Mom
off your scent!
<br/>
Great job.
She has no idea!
<br/>
We are supposed
to be a team
against them !
<br/>
They were getting
along so well
<br/>
l let it blind me
to the truth !
<br/>
Why were you
taking pictures?
<br/>
lt was so crazy that morning,
l forgot we took the pictures.
<br/>
So l let it slide.
And l am so sorry.
<br/>
Oh, God.
lt feels so good
to get that out.
<br/>
l haven't been able to look
at that bathroom door
for two weeks!
<br/>
l knew that door
had a lock on it!
<br/>
And everybody was
trying to make me feel
like l was losing my mind !
<br/>
We're just gonna
let ourselves out.
<br/>
l wouldn't write
a column about this.
<br/>
(DOOR CLOSES)
<br/>
l'm going upstairs!
<br/>
To a bathroom
that has a lock on it
<br/>
and no one can tell me
that it doesn't.
<br/>
l have to go talk
to your father.
<br/>
l will deal with
you boys later.
<br/>
Rodrick, l really
didn't tell her!
<br/>
l mean maybe, sort of,
but l made a deal with her,
<br/>
and we had a really
good time, and. . .
<br/>
You're my brother,
<br/>
but you'll never
be my friend.
<br/>
(SUSAN BREATHES DEEPLY)
<br/>
Your father and l have talked
and we've decided
on your punishment.
<br/>
Greg, you're grounded
for two weeks.
<br/>
Also, no video games
for two weeks.
<br/>
Rodrick, you may only
drive to and from school
for the next month.
<br/>
As the ringleader,
you are also grounded
for a month.
<br/>
Mom, l'm sorry,
and l won't do it again.
<br/>
l know you won't.
<br/>
And to make sure
<br/>
we're also
not allowing you to
perform in the talent show.
<br/>
What? No.
You can't do that.
<br/>
Ground me for a year,
l don't care,
<br/>
but you have to let me
play in that show.
<br/>
This could be
my big break.
l'm sorry.
<br/>
Dad? Come on. This isn't fair.
l just got Bill in the band !
<br/>
Actually, Rodrick,
that doesn't
help your case.
<br/>
Bill's kind of a jerk.
<br/>
Our decision is final.
<br/>
(WHlSPERS)
You are so dead !
<br/>
GREG: Things have
never been worse.
<br/>
Our parents are
super mad at us,
<br/>
so we have to
spend the weekend
<br/>
at my grandpa's
boring retirement community.
<br/>
Holly Hills thinks
I'm Fregley,
<br/>
and my relationship
with Rodrick
is at an all-time low.
<br/>
So he's made it his mission
to ruin my life.
<br/>
Quit it!
<br/>
Why don't you tell Mom?
You're good at that.
<br/>
Grandpa doesn't like TV.
<br/>
lnstead,
he prefers to watch the lobby
on the security channel.
<br/>
l should be
rehearsing right now.
<br/>
Please, Grandpa.
Please, can we watch
a real TV show now?
<br/>
TV is just
a bunch of fakers.
<br/>
This is real life.
<br/>
lt's real life.
You can't beat it.
<br/>
(SlGHS)
<br/>
How's about we all go down
to the games room?
<br/>
You boys like games,
don't you?
<br/>
GREG: The games room
sounds fun
<br/>
until you realize that
all the games in there
are from, like, the 1 800s.
<br/>
My grandpa's favorite
is a really old board game
called Gutbusters.
<br/>
Now, remember,
the object of the game
is to read the joke card
<br/>
and all the other players
have to try not to laugh.
<br/>
(SNlCKERS) Good luck!
There are some real
rib-ticklers in there!
<br/>
Yeah.
<br/>
You go first.
<br/>
"Putting economic policy
before fiscal responsibility
<br/>
"is like putting the cart
before the horse."
<br/>
(LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
That is hilarious, Grandpa!
Read another one, Greg.
<br/>
l'm going to go
change my shirt.
<br/>
Hi !
<br/>
Oh, hi, Holly.
What are you
doing here?
<br/>
l'm visiting my grandma.
She just moved here.
<br/>
l'm on Grandpa duty.
<br/>
Listen, Greg,
l'm really sorry for calling
you Fregley the other day.
<br/>
l don't know
what happened.
<br/>
l think
it's the Greg and Freg part,
my brain just flipped.
<br/>
You called me Fregley?
l had no idea.
<br/>
Really?
<br/>
Not really.
<br/>
l heard it.
lt was pretty rough.
<br/>
But don't worry,
l have the rest of
middle school to get over it.
<br/>
What happened
to your shirt?
<br/>
Oh, my brother
spit milk on me.
<br/>
Let me guess,
he was pretending
to laugh
<br/>
at something that
wasn't actually funny.
<br/>
How did you know?
<br/>
lt's in the
Older Sibling
Handbook.
<br/>
Last week, my older sister
put hair remover
in my shampoo.
<br/>
lf l hadn't smelled something,
l'd be completely bald by now!
<br/>
Why would she do that?
<br/>
Duh ! 'Cause
she's my sister.
<br/>
lt's part of the deal.
You fight and then
you get over it.
<br/>
Not my brother.
He hates me
<br/>
and he'll never
get over it.
<br/>
Of course he will.
He has to.
He's your brother.
<br/>
l also have a little sister
who's spoiled rotten.
<br/>
Tell me about it!
My little brother
ruins all my stuff,
<br/>
and somehow l'm the one
who ends up getting
in trouble for it.
<br/>

RODRlCK: Hey, Greg !
<br/>
What's new? Huh?
<br/>
GREG: Well, my life
is officially over.
<br/>
Now that Rodrick
has that tape of me
<br/>
running around
in my underwear,
<br/>
he basically owns me.
<br/>
(GREG GROANlNG)
<br/>
The day of
the talent show
came around
<br/>
and Mom and Dad
made us both go.
<br/>
Something about supporting
the community, or whatever.
<br/>
ROWLEY: Scotty!
<br/>
Come on !
<br/>
Scotty! Come on !
<br/>
You don't wanna let
the magic fans down,
do you?
<br/>
SCOTTY: Go away!
<br/>
Rowley, what's wrong?
<br/>
My assistant, Scotty,
got stage fright
<br/>
and now he doesn't
want to do the show.
<br/>
Maybe Greg would help out.
He can be your assistant.
<br/>
What? No way!
<br/>
What? Rowley is
your best friend.
<br/>
This is important to him.
You need to do this.
<br/>
lt's okay,
Mrs. Heffley.
<br/>
Greg is just afraid
that Holly Hills
will think less of him.
<br/>
GREG: Rowley.
<br/>
Mom, can we
talk in private?
Sure.
<br/>
Scotty, please.
<br/>
Look. . .
Who's this Holly Hills?
<br/>
ls she your girlfriend?
No!
<br/>
She's just some girl
who happens to be a friend
<br/>
who l don't want
to be humiliated
in front of.
<br/>
l see your point.
<br/>
So is this Holly
in your class?
<br/>
Mom !
<br/>
Okay.
<br/>
Here we go.
<br/>
So, are you going
to make me do it?
<br/>
ROWLEY:
Please, Scotty.
<br/>
No. No, l get it.
l get it.
<br/>
Can you at least
point her out to me?
<br/>
Okay, okay, l'll stop.
<br/>
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,
<br/>

Wow, she's really good.

I remember the time

I knew

<br/>
Let the memory live again

Touch me

It's so easy to leave me

All alone with the memory

Of my days in the sun

If you touch me...

Don't you think. . .
(BLATHERlNG)
<br/>
(SUSAN GASPS)
<br/>
Greg ! Where have you been?
l've been looking
all over for you.
<br/>
Mom, you need to
let Rodrick play in
the talent show tonight.
<br/>
Greg, we've been over this.
He needs to learn a lesson.
<br/>
His band is
playing without him,
and it's not fair.
<br/>
And l'm sure that's
very hard on him,
<br/>
but l can't go back
on the punishment.
<br/>
Mom.
Yes?
<br/>
You let Rodrick play
in the talent show,
<br/>
l'll. . .
<br/>
. . .do the magic thing
with Rowley.
<br/>
Really?
You'd do that?
<br/>
You'll be Rowley's partner,
even though you said
<br/>
it's totally embarrassing
and humiliating?
<br/>
You're willing to do that
just so your brother can play?
<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
Come here.
<br/>
l mean,
how bad can it be?
<br/>
(ALL EXCLAlMlNG)
<br/>
(AUDlENCE MURMURlNG)
<br/>
ROWLEY: (WHlSPERS)
Scotty was right.
<br/>
There's a lot of
people out there.
<br/>
Just start with
your opening trick,
like you rehearsed at home.
<br/>
Forget about
all the people. Go.
<br/>
(EXHALES)
<br/>
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.
<br/>
l am the Remarkable Rowley,

And joining me onstage is

<br/>
Greg !

Maybe he needs a scarf.
<br/>
(ALL LAUGHlNG)

Ew! Don't put them on me!

<br/>
(ALL LAUGHlNG)
<br/>
