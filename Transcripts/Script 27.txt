'Cause there's nothing to finagle
<i>And no one to finesse</i>

Pure and perfect
Sublime and shining
Every cloud has a silver lining
Everyone's full of good cheer
<i>It's so heavenly here</i>
Charlie: <i>They're all so saintly</i>
I just can't relate
There's gotta be an exit
Through that pearly gate
Behold, the canine who's been cut down in his prime
I may have done the crime,
<i>But I can't do the time</i>
'Cause it's too heavenly here
All "Hallelujah's" and "Hosanna's"
It could drive anyone <i>bananas</i>
I'm going out of my head
This joint is deader than <i>dead</i>
I'll give you 8 to 3

01:11:48 Let me sleep on it.
01:11:52 I don't have that kind of time.
