<i>(After the MGM logo and opening credits, we fade in on an outdoor shot of 1940s Indiana.)</i>
<i>(We crossfade to an exterior shot of downtown as the credits continue.)</i>
<i>Sights we see and hear include: a marching band playing "Jingle Bells," one of Santa's helpers standing by a store window ringing a bell, carolers singing "Go Tell It on the Mountain," and Ralphie and friends running toward the Higbee's window.</i>
<i>(The music changes as Ralphie walks toward a very specific item in the window and begins staring longingly at it.)</i>
<i>(We now see Ralphie, sitting at home in his and Randy [Ian Petrella]'s bedroom. Ralphie stares off into the distance, holding a magazine turned to the Red Ryder ad, while Randy plays with a toy airplane.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie runs off, and we get our first look at the Old Man (Darren McGavin). He approaches the table with a newspaper in his hand.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie eventually comes down and approaches the kitchen table.)</i>
<i>(As the conversation continues, the scene pans across to Ralphie, pondering.)</i>
<i>The rest of the family Parker just looks at him disconcertingly.</i>
<i>(Randy whines.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie leans on his hand.)</i>
<i>(The first fantasy sequence of the movie begins as a gang of bandits, dressed like bank robbers, crowd around the house. Ralphie, now dressed in a sparkly cowboy outfit, barges in through the kitchen door, Red Ryder in hand. His family is all crowded underneath the table, wearing Western attire.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie approaches the window and aims his rifle out, frightening the bandits.)</i>
<i>In rapid motion, Ralphie starts shooting down bandits.</i>
<i>(Ralphie continues to shoot at the bandits, until finally, Black Bart surrenders.)</i>
<i>Black Bart's horse appears, and he jumps onto it, riding off. Ralphie spits again.</i>
<i>(The Old Man barges back in, donning his hat and coat, and starts heading for the kitchen sink.)</i>
<i>(Mrs. Parker outfits Randy into his layers and layers of winter wear.)</i>
<i>(Mrs. Parker's dressing up continues. Ralphie, on the other hand, has less of an issue, seeing how he has less layers on him.)</i>
<i>Mrs. Parker tries, but under the weight of his coat, they keep rising.</i>
<i>We pan down from the Parkers' house, as the Old Man continues to struggle with the furnace, and Ralphie and Randy walk out.</i>
<i>Schwartz [R.D. Robb] comes out of his house and approaches the boys.</i>
<i>(Lagging behind the trio is Randy, still struggling from his overdone winter wear.)</i>
<i>(We pan over to an exterior shot of Warren G. Harding Elementary School. Cut inside, where the kids quickly grab false teeth.)</i>
<i>As they run to their desks, in walks Miss Shields [Tedde Moore].</i>
<i>(Some kids start laughing, and Miss Shields takes notice. The kids, disappointed, start turning in the false teeth. She opens a drawer inside her desk, full of other prank items like chattering teeth and a fake rat, and drops them there.)</i>
<i>(Recess. Pan down the American flag to the entire class, crowded around the pole.)</i>
<i>(He pushes the other kids out of the way and walks right to the pole. The music gets suspenseful, and the kids get tense. Naturally, so does Flick.)</i>
<i>(Flick sticks out his tongue and lunges right for the pole.)</i>
<i>(He screams again, and we cut to a concerned Miss Shields.)</i>
<i>(The class runs over to the window as well, except for Ralphie and Schwartz. They all watch Flick struggle to get away from the pole, and Miss Shields runs out to get help. Not too terribly long later, a fire truck drives by.)</i>
<i>Afterwards, a police car comes into view.</i>
<i>(Ralphie looks down As he buries his head in his arms</i> <i>A fireman and two police officers help get Flick's tongue off the pole. When they do so, the spectators clap.</i>
<i>(Miss Shields walks Flick, bandaged tongue and everything, back into class.)</i>
<i>(The scene irises out.)</i>
<i>(We iris back in on a pair of approaching feet, behind a wooden fence. Pan over to the Parker brothers, Flick, and Schwartz on their walk back home from school.)</i>
<i>(Just then, they hear sinister laughter and turn the other way. Then we see the head of an older kid [Zack Ward], poking out from behind the fence.)</i>
<i>(The kids scream and run for the dumpster. Just then, out pops another kid (Yano Anaya), in a brown coat and dark gray cap, scaring the kids even more.)</i>
<i>(They run off screaming, with Ralphie remembering to help Randy up, and Scut and Grover laugh. It continues into them politely slugging one another, before Scut gives Grover a hard punch in the arm.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie is in his bedroom, going over his finished theme and reading from it.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie then notices something from the off. He leans toward his window and opens up. The Old Man is in the driveway, excited.)</i>
<i>(Alas, he is being harassed by a gaggle of dogs.)</i>
<i>(Mrs. Parker shrugs and heads off to make dinner.)</i>
<i>(The Parker family is now seated at the dinner table. Randy picks at his food, and at one point, throws a gob of mashed potatoes onto his plate.)</i>
<i>(The Old Man looks away from his paper.)</i>
<i>(And sure enough, Randy dives his face into the plate, oinking and chomping away at his dinner. Both of them are having fun with it Ralphie and the old man look on disgusted..)</i>
<i>(Suddenly, all activity at the dinner table is stopped by a knock on the door. The Old Man puts his paper down.)</i>
<i>(Everyone starts for the door, and the Old Man opens it.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie tries feeling it up again, but his mom pushes him away. Then they go off to set it up. The first time the Old Man plugs it in, we see a spark, and the power goes out due to a fuse overload. He removes the plug, and the lights go back on.)</i>
<i>(The Old Man rushes outside, wanting to see his prized possession from a distance.)</i>
<i>(Back inside...)</i>
<i>(The theme to the </i>Little Orphan Annie<i> radio show begins.)</i>
<i>The Old Man knocks on the door.</i>
<i>(He just shrugs it off and walks away.)</i>
<i>(The next day, our heroes are being chased by Scut Farkus and Grover Dill again. And once again, Randy falls behind.)</i>
<i>(In Miss Shields' class, everyone is turning in their themes. This includes Ralphie.)</i>
<i>(We begin our next fantasy sequence: an overworked Miss Shields, dressed fancily, laboring over themes.)</i>
<i>(The kids start cheering Ralphie on for his effort, and Miss Shields continues to write "+"s on the chalkboard - and even on the classroom walls. We go back to reality, with Ralphie still daydreaming.)</i>
<i>Ralphie snaps out of it, and the kids laugh at him.</i>
<i>(Which he does.)</i>
<i>(On the return trip home, it's another getaway from Scut and Grover. Then we cut to the Parker family at night, preparing to leave.)</i>
<i>(We then cut to a Christmas tree lot.)</i>
<i>(Inside the car, the family except for the Old Man is singing "Jingle Bells." At the end, they blow raspberries and laugh it off. Suddenly...)</i>
<i>The car stops.</i>
<i>(Ralphie gets out all the way.)</i>
<i>(Beat.)</i>
<i>(Back inside the car, Ralphie continues to look sad.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie can only nod, mildly. After the spare tire is put on, the Old Man checks his watch and groans. He gets back inside, and checks the time with his wife.)</i>
<i>(Suddenly, Ralphie is sitting in the bathroom, with a bar of soap in his mouth. A stern Mrs. Parker stands over him.)</i>
<i>(In bed, Ralphie weeps softly to himself over what had just happened.)</i>
<i>(Fantasy sequence #3 begins: a blind Ralphie walks toward the door, using his cane to knock. His mom opens.)</i>
<i>(Which he does. And before long, his parents notice.)</i>
<i>(They are suddenly surprised as Ralphie holds out a mug for change. Randy comes downstairs and joins in on it.)</i>
<i>(The parents cry and latch onto Ralphie.)</i>
<i>(As they continue sobbing, Ralphie smiles over his payback. Fade back into the real world, and iris out to the next scene.)</i>
<i>(The next day, en route to school, it's business as usual: Ralphie, Flick, and Schwartz being chased by Scut and Grover, with Randy falling behind. Cut to Miss Shields' class, where students give her fruits as a token of their appreciation. Ralphie goes overboard, bringing a whole basket with him. He sets it on her desk. She pushes it aside, and sees her student.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie flashes a signal at her.)</i>
<i>(Business as usual on the way home. Much like a few days ago, Ralphie runs up to the mailbox in anticipation.)</i>
<i>(He excitedly runs inside. Later that night, he's at his desk, reading the enclosed letter.)</i>
<i>Ralphie turns on the radio, where a pirate serial is in progress.</i>
<i>(The yelling continues for another few seconds, and then...)</i>
<i>(The code continues as Ralphie writes each number down.)</i>
<i>(Ralphie excitedly hurries to the family bathroom, pen, paper, and decoder pin in hand. He sets himself up to decode the message.)</i>
<i>(Randy walks into the bathroom and puts the toilet seat up.)</i>
<i>(In the kitchen, Randy takes the lid off a pot on the stove, investigating what his mom's cooking.)</i>
<i>Mrs. Parker, having just finished filling her watering cup, goes off to the living room.</i>
<i>(We hear a crashing sound. The Old Man, struggling with the furnace once again, comes out of the furnace room, steamed and covered in smoke.) no</i>
<i>Distraught, the Old Man appears ready to strangle his wife at first. But instead, he takes off his gloves and snatches what remained of his major award.</i>
<i>(He runs outside, and we see the leg, fully rebuilt. And just as the Old Man is about to add the finishing touch - the lampshade - it cracks under the pressure. He looks at his wife, trying to hide her schadenfreude.)</i>
<i>(The next day, at school...)</i>
<i>(Suddenly, all three are startled by none other than Scut Farkus, hanging down from the climbing dome. The kids run off, and in comes Grover Dill.)</i>
<i>Schwartz willingly submits.</i>
<i>(In Miss Shields' class, she's returning the students' themes Flick enters with a black eye.)</i>
<i>(A miserable Ralphie sadly trudges on home. That is, until he's stopped by a snowball to the face. He removes his glasses, and looks up to see the bully and his toady, laughing at him.)</i>
<i>(Scut drops down.)</i>
<i>(Finally, Ralphie just can't take it anymore - and pins Scut down to the ground, launching a violent assault on him. Grover takes notice.)</i>
<i>(Grover runs off, and the other kids stop to watch as Ralphie beats Scut senseless some more.)</i>
<i>(The screaming continues, and eventually, Randy corrals his mom over to the scene. Mrs. Parker runs over to Ralphie, still enraged.)</i>
<i>(Scut, suffering a visible nosebleed, gets up. He wipes it.)</i>
<i>(That night, Ralphie and his mother go off to the bathroom sink.)</i>
...
<i>Ralphie is lying on his bed.</i>
<i>Outside, the Old Man is being harassed by the Bumpus Hounds again.</i>
<i>Ralphie trudges downstairs, all the way to the dinner table. He takes his seat next to his old man, who is reading the paper.</i>
<i>Cut to Ralphie in his bed.</i>
<i>Crossfade to the big Christmas Eve parade outside Higbee's. A marching band plays "Jingle Bells," and we see a lot of characters from </i>The Wizard of Oz<i>, mostly flying monkeys.</i>
<i>The parade continues, and the band goes into "Deck the Halls."</i>
<i>The parade goes on.</i>
<i>Cut to Mickey Mouse in the parade, dancing with </i>Wizard of Oz<i> characters.</i>
<i>Passing by is Santa himself, in a giant snow-covered roof.</i>
<i>They all make their way inside, and we get our first glimpse at Higbee's Santa.</i>
<i>The Parker boys stop at the stairs, and are themselves stopped.</i>
<i>The boys are now at the very end of the line. A version of "Jingle Bells" plays over the PA, and a kid cries.</i>
<i>Just then, a creepy kid in aviator goggles (David Svoboda) turns to Ralphie.</i>
<i>Then we see Santa (Jeff Gillen) on his throne.</i>
<i>Back down, a Wicked Witch cosplayer (Helen E. Kaider) sweeps the aisle.</i>
<i>The Witch leaves.</i>
<i>Ralphie just turns to the kid, concerned.</i>
<i>Finally, Ralphie and Randy make their way up the stairs. Suddenly, the PA catches Ralphie's attention.</i>
<i>Santa tangles with another kid, who starts screaming. The elf sends her down as well. Randy eventually has his turn with Santa, and then another elf (Patty Johnson) trudges up the stairs.</i>
<i>She starts dragging Ralphie up.</i>
<i>Finally, Ralphie winds up in Santa's lap. The camera spins all around.</i>
<i>Ralphie ands in a pile of snow. We then see the other Parkers with </i>Oz<i> characters.</i>
<i>The parents pick up their kids.</i>
<i>They start making their way out of the store.</i>
<i>Iris out.</i>
<i>Iris back in to the Parker residence. The Old Man is busy fumbling with the tree.</i>
<i>The Old Man fumbles and fixes it. Then he notices something else.</i>
<i>The bulb is attached, and the blue lights come on. And then we see a spark, and the lights go out. Everyone screams.</i>
<i>The lights go back on, and the parents admire the tree. Randy yawns, inspiring Mrs. Parker to check her watch.</i>
<i>Ralphie and Randy fumble and fight on their way upstairs.</i>
<i>The next day, we pan over to Ralphie's face. He wakes up, and opens his window.</i>
<i>Outside, we see a beautiful vision of snow-covered Indiana. Ralphie turns to Randy.</i>
<i>The kids excitedly race downstairs. They admire their presents.</i>
<i>They run down and start playing with their presents.</i>
<i>Just then, the parents walk down.</i>
<i>The Parkers start tearing into their presents.</i>
...
...
<i>Ralphie opens his present from Aunt Clara, revealing it to be a pink bunny outfit.</i>
<i>Ralphie runs upstairs.</i>
<i>Down comes Ralphie, clad in the bunny suit.</i>
<i>In the aftermath of Christmas, Randy lies asleep, sitting around a zeppelin and a Frankenstein mask. We pan up to the rest of the family.</i>
<i>Ralphie gets up, and starts walking toward the box. His excited parents watch as he tears off the wrapping paper to reveal what he wanted all along: an official Red Ryder carbine action 200-shot range model air rifle.</i>
<i>He takes the rifle out of the box to admire it.</i>
<i>Ralphie makes his way out the kitchen door, and his parents follow.</i>
<i>Outside, Ralphie prepares to take his first shot.</i>
<i>He aims at a target, planted right upon a metal sign. Just then, Ralphie fires, and the bullet ricochets off of the sign, knocking him to the ground.</i>
<i>Back inside, the Old Man tries to sneak off some turkey, until his wife comes in.</i>
<i>The Old Man runs off, and back outside, Ralphie saunters through the snow. We hear a crack, and he lifts his boot up to reveal he stepped on his glasses.</i>
<i>Ralphie starts crying, and his mom stops cutting the turkey.</i>
<i>She runs outside, and finds Ralphie crying in the snow.</i>
<i>Inside, the Old Man cuts at the turkey.</i>
<i>The Old Man slams his knife on the table, then sneaks off a piece of turkey.</i>
<i>Mrs. Parker takes her son inside, and off to the bathroom, where she ails his wound with some rubbing alcohol.</i>
<i>Cut to the Old Man on his easy chair, reading the newspaper</i>
<i>And with an open door comes unthinkable disaster, as dogs start walking into the house. Not just any hounds, but the Bumpuses. They knock down the table with the turkey on it, barking and setting off the Parkers. The Old Man gets up.</i>
<i>Unfortunately for him, the dogs had already gobbled up the whole dinner. The Old Man chases them out.</i>
<i>He walks back inside, and Mrs. Parker starts weeping. The Old Man then picks up a piece of turkey.</i>
<i>Mrs. Parker still cries until Ralphie hands her the washcloth. The Old Man has an idea...</i>
<i>The Parkers are now at a Chinese restaurant. Three singing waiters stand around the Parkers' table.</i>
<i>The chef brings out a big roasted duck with its' head intact. Mrs. Parker shrieks and starts giggling.</i>
<i>They laugh it off, and the father cuts the "head" off, scaring Mrs. Parker momentarily before laughing loudly. Ralphie watches the whole thing in amazement, trying not to laugh. Then they all applaud.</i>
<i>Iris out.</i>
<i>Iris back in to the Parker house that night. Mrs. Parker walks down the stairs, watching the light show with her husband.</i>
<i>We then cut to the boys in bed, Randy with his zeppelin and Ralphie with his rifle.</i>
<i>Crossfade to outside the house, where the end credits roll. Fade out.</i>
