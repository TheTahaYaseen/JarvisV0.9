DIMITRI: (whispers to Vlad) Hey, Vlad, Vlad tickets! (to Anya)Ah sure would like to … in fact, oddly enough, we’re going to Paris ourselves.
(Vlad pulls the tickets out of his pocket, we see that they are Moscow Circus tickets. He hands them to Dimitri anyway.)
DIMITRI (CONT’D): … Ah, ah, and I’ve got three AW … well, this one is, but I’ve got tickets here …
(Anya tries to grab the tickets.)
ANYA: oh I
DIMITRI (CONT’D): … Eh, Unfortunately the third one is for her, Anastasia.
(He gestures to Anastasia’s portrait in the frieze. Anya looks up.)
ANYA: Oh.
(The two men take Anya by the arm leading her to a portrait of Marie.)
VLADIMIR: We are going to reunite the Grand Duchess Anastasia with her grandmother.
DIMITRI (setting her up): You do kind of resemble her.
VLADIMIR: The same blue eyes.
DIMITRI: The Romanov eyes.
VLADIMIR: Nicholas’ smile.
DIMITRI: Alexandra’s chin.
(Vladimir takes her by the hand.)
VLADIMIR: Oh, look she even has the grandmother’s hands!
(ANGLE on Anya as she pulls her hand away)
DIMITRI: She’s the same age, the same physical type.
ANYA: Are you trying to tell me that you think that I am Anastasia?
DIMITRI: All I’m trying to tell you is that I’ve seen thousands of girls all over the country and not one of them looks as much like the Grand Duchess as you do. I mean look at the portrait.
ANYA (To Dimitri): I knew you were crazy from the beginning, but now I think you are both mad. HMM.
(Anya walks away.)
DIMITRI: Why? You don’t remember what happened to you…
VLAD: No one knows what happened to her.
DIMITRI: You’re looking for family in Paris.
VLAD: And her only family is in Paris.
DIMITRI: Ever thought about the possibility?
ANYA: That I could be royalty?
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: MmmHmm
(They both nod.)
ANYA: Well I don’t know … it’s kind of hard to think of yourself as a Duchess when you’re sleeping on a damp floor. But sure, yeah, I guess every lonely girl would hope she’s a Princess.
<br/>
(Anya, caught up in the fantasy is now right next to them. Dimitri then turns and walks away.)
VLADIMIR: And somewhere … One little girl is. After all, the name Anastasia means "she will rise again".
(Dimitri, exasperated that Vladimir is still talking to her, turns and walks back to them to retrieve Vlad.)
DIMITRI: Really wish we could help, but the third ticket is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia.
ANYA: Sigh!
DIMITRI: Good luck.
(Dimitri and Vlad start walking down the stairs.)
VLADIMIR: Why didn’t you tell her about our brilliant plan?
DIMITRI: All she wants to do is go to Paris. Why give away a third of the reward money.
CUT TO: 
UNDERSCORE: "THE MUSIC BOX THEME"
(Anya, alone on the landing, looks at the frieze of Marie and young Anastasia.)
CUT TO: 
(Dimitri and Vladirnir.)
VLADIMIR: (whispered) I’m telling you … We’re walking away too soon …
DIMITRI (whispered): Not to worry, I got it all under control, All right… but walk a little slower. 
CUT TO:
(Anya as she fiddles with the key then touches the portrait She looks up at Marie’s face.)
CUT TO:
ANYA: Hmm...
(Dlmitri and Vladimir walking down the steps)
DIMITRI (silently): Three … Two … One.
ANYA: Dimitri!
(Dimitri smiles.)
VLADIMIR: Ha, right in the palm of our hand.
(Dimitri turns and looks back at Anya on the stairs.)
ANYA: (shouts) Dimitri, wait!
DIMITRI (innocent): Di … Did you call me?
ANYA: if I don’t remember who I am, then who’s to say I’m not a princess or a duchess or a whatever she is … Right?
DIMITRI: Hmm … Go on.
ANYA: Yeah, and if I’m not Anastasia, the Empress will certainly know right away … and it’s all just an honest mistake.
DIMITRI: Sounds plausible.
VLADIMIR: But if you are the princess, then you’ll finally know who you are and have your family back.
DIMITRI: (both laughing): You know, you know he’s right! Either way, it gets you to Paris.
(Anya puts her hand out for a handshake. Dimitri, a little taken aback, shakes it’. She gives him a solid shake. He grabs his hand in pain.)
ANYA: Right!
DIMITRI: OW!

INT. RANSACKED PALACE RAFTERS
(DOWNSHOT Bartok’s POV of Dimitri, Vladimir and Anya. )
DIMITRI: May I present her Royal Highness the Grand Duchess Anastasia.

ANYA: Pooka we are going to Paris!
DIMITRI: The dog stays.
ANYA: What are you talking about, the dog goes.
DIMITRI: The dog does not go.
ANYA: I say he’s going.
DIMITRI: I’m allergic to dogs.
(TILT UP as a breeze seems to carry the ECHO up to the rafters. The Reliquary glows behind Bartok, unnoticed as he looks down at the trio below. SMOKE wisps ominously from its top.)
BARTOK: Anastasia. Yeah, just one problem there fella, Anastasia’s dead. All the Romanovs are dead. They’re dead, dead, dead, dead …
(A Minion emerges from the Reliquary, hovering beside Bartok.)
BARTOK (CONT’D): (to Minion) … Am I right my friend. I mean, how could that be Ana … (realizing whom he’s talking to)
BARTOK: Aah … YAAAAGH!!!
(Minions pour forth from the Reliquary, eagerly reaching toward Anya but disappearing in a puff of smoke inches from their unearthly home…)
BARTOK: Oh, come on now. Am I supposed to believe that thing woke up after all these years just because some guy claims she’s a Romanov?
(The Reliquary glows bright, shaking violently.)
BARTOK: (spooked) Okay! Okay! I get-the message! Enough already with glowing and the smoke people!
(He takes another look at Anya, far below.)
BARTOK: (amazed) If that things come back to life it must mean Anastasia’s alive.
DIMITRI: Just leave the dog.
ANYA: I am not leaving the dog.
BARTOK (CONT’D): … and that’s her.
VLADIMIR: Come we’ve got a train to catch.
(The Reliquary takes off like a rocket, dragging Bartok with it’ They dive straight-for the floor, Bartokcovers his eyes as he crashes through the floor.)
BARTOK: Whoah! ! !
(The Reliquary pulls him down into the icy water pulling him further and further down. He hits the bottom of the lake and is now in the soil under the water, continuing to do down.)
(He continues to go down further into the earth at a tremendous speed.)
BARTOK: Mayday, Mayday. Hey I ooh, ooh,,ooh, waah, ooh yuck, yuck, wow, help, oh,,oh, oh, oh, hot it,s hot, aah, oh oh … wow …
INT. RASPUTIN’S CHAMBER - THE NETHER WORLD

(Rasputin, in a rage, grips Bartok in one fist. He doesn’t even know he’s holding the bat as he squeezes for emphasis.)
RASPUTIN: That’s why …
BARTOK: Wow, wow …
RASPUTIN (CONT’D): … I’m stuck here in limbo!
(He raises Bartok for the final blow. Bartok SQUEAKS in terror. Rasputin finally realizes he’s about to crush Bartok.)
RASPUTIN (CONT’D): My curse is unfulfilled.
(He flings his hand. His hand still gripping Bartok, disconnects and hits the wall. He stops, realizing his hand is gone.)
(Bartok carries Rasputin’s hand, over to him. collapsed onto his bed, filled with-self-pity.)
BARTOK: Wow, Ooh, Oh … (HUMMING AND GRUNTING AS HE CARRIES THE HAND)
RASPUTIN: (Crying) Look at me. I’m falling apart. I’m a wreck.
BARTOK: Actually, considering how long you’ve been dead you look pretty good.
RASPUTIN: (Crying)
BARTOK: Sir, you do, you do
RASPUTIN: (Truly flattered) Really?
BARTOK: Sir is this the face of a bat who would lie to you? Come on, for a minute there, you had your old spark back.
RASPUTIN: If only I hadn’t lost the gift from the dark forces, the key to my powers.
(Bartok picks up the Reliquary from the rubble.)
BARTOK: What? You mean this Re1iquary?
(Rasputin’s eyes widen.)
RASPUTIN: Oh, Where did you get that?
BARTOK: Oh, I found it …
RASPUTIN: ( Interrupts) GIVE IT TO ME!
(He grabs the Reliquary.)
BARTOK: Alright, Alright, Don’t get so grabby.

DIMITRI: No! No! Yaaaaa!
(With Anya’s help he yanks himself up just as the shrapnel whips by, shattering a tree. They land in near embrace, and catch their breath. Their eyes meet, stirring some distant feeling. Dimitri snaps out of it first, glancing back to the shattered tree receding it the distance.)

RASPUTIN: Screams. (In agony) Noooooooo!!
BARTOK: Wow, hey take it easy there. You know, sir, really you should watch your blood pressure. My nephew Izzie just keeled over one day, mid-mango. Stress. it’s a killer sir. And he’s a fruit bat, no meat, no blood even.
(Rasputin stares blankly at Bartok for a beat, then)
RASPUTIN: HOW COULD THEY LET HER ESCAPE?!
BARTOK: Ha wow … Ah, you’re right. It’s very upsetting sir. (PICKS UP RELIQUARY) Eh, I guess this Reliquary thing’s broken.
(Bartok tosses the Reliquary over his shoulder- It flies through the air. Rasputin’s eyes go wide in terror as he leaps to catch it.)
RASPUTIN : You idiot!
(As he skids across the floor he flings his own hand ahead.)

BARTOK: Anastasia, sir. Just wishing I could do the job for you -- Sir, I’d give her a Ha then a hi ya and then a woowah and I’d kick her, sir.
(Bartok mimes karate chops with his wings. He gets tangled up in his own wings, tripping himself. Rasputin watches disgusted.)

(On descending from the mountains, spring is in the air. The crocus’ are peeking their heads thru patches of snow. Vladimir is in a feverish excitement over meeting an old flame in Paris.)
ANYA: Are we going to walk to Paris?
DIMITRI: We’ll take a boat in Germany
ANYA: Oh. Then we’re walking to Germany?
DIMITRI: No, your grace. We’re taking a bus.
ANYA: A bus! That’s nice.
VLADIMIR: (calling out) Sophie, my dear, Vlady’s on his way!
ANYA: Who’s Sophie?
VLADIMIR: (lost in warm memories) Who is Sophie? … She’s a tender little morsel.
DIMITRI: Vlad.
VLADIMIR (CONT’D): The cup of hot chocolate after a long walk in the snow.
DIMITRI: Vlad, Xnay on the offesay
VLADIMIR: She’s a decadent pastry filled with whipped cream and laughter …
ANYA: Is this a person or a cream puff?
VLADIMIR: She is the Empress’ ravishing first cousin. (Humming)
ANYA: But I thought we were going to see the Empress herself. Why are we going to see her 
cousin? Dlmitri!!
DIMITRI: Well, nobody gets near the Dowager Empress without convincing Sophie first.
(Vladimir hums and gathers flowers in the background.)
ANYA: Oh no, not me, no. Nobody ever told me I had to -prove I was the Grand Duchess.
D’MITRI: Look, I . . .
ANYA: Show up. Yes. Look nice. Fine. But lie?
(She fiddles with her necklace.)
DIMITRI: You don’t know it’s a lie. What if it’s true? OK, so there’s one more stop on the road to finding out who you are. I just thought this was something you had to see through to the end no matter what.
ANYA: (sighs) But look at me, Dimitri! I am not exactly Grand Duchess material here, Aah.
(Anya stomps off.)
CROSS DISSOLVE TO:
(To bridge where Anya joins Vladimir. He directs her attention to the water.)
VLADIMIR: Tell me, child, what do you see?
(She looks at her reflection, face smudged and wearing boy’s clothes.)
ANYA: I see a skinny little nobody, with no past and no future.
VLADIMIR: I see a engaging and fiery young woman … who on a number of occasions has shown a regal command equal to any royal in the world. And I have known my share of royalty. You see my dear, I was a member of the imperial Court.
ANYA: Hmm (Sigh)
(Dlmitri’s face shows up reflected in the pond next to theirs.)
DIMITRI: So, are you ready to become the Grand Duchess Anastasia?
(Anya is still annoyed at Dimitri for not being honest with her. Vladimir gives Dimitri a look.)
DIMITRI: What?!
VLADIMIR: There’s nothing left for you back there my dear. Everything is in Paris.
(Beat, She decides.)
ANYA: Gentlemen, start your teaching.
MUSICAL NUMBER BEGINS
VLADIMIR: I remember it well.
LEARN TO DO IT
VLADIMIR: YOU WERE BORN 
IN A PALACE BY THE SEA
ANYA: A PALACE BY THE SEA. COULD IT BE?
VLADIMIR: YES, THAT’S RIGHT.

DIMITRI AND VLADIMIR: WE’VE LOTS AND LOTS TO TEACH YOU AND THE TIME IS GOING FAST!
VLADIMIR: NOW, SHOULDERS BACK AND STAND UP TALL
DIMITRI: AND DO NOT WALK, BUT TRY TO FLOAT.

ANYA: I FEEL A LITTLE FOOLISH 
AM I FLOATING?
VLADIMIR: LIKE A LITTLE BOAT!
DIMITRI: YOU GIVE A BOW.
ANYA: WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
(Anya curtsies, placing her hand in Dimitris)
VLADIMIR: YOUR HAND RECEIVES A KISS!
(Anya and Dimitri pull away, embarrassed)
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: MOST OF ALL REMEMBER THIS:
VLADIMIR: IF I CAN LEARN TO DO IT. 
YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT.
DIMITRI: SOMETHING IN YOU KNOWS IT—
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: THERE’S NOTHING TO IT!
VLADIMIR: FOLLOW IN MY FOOTSTEPS, SHOE BY SHOE!
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT TOO!
VLADIMIR.: NOW, ELBOW IN AND SIT UP STRAIGHT
DIMITRI: AND NEVER SLURP THE STROGANOFF
ANYA: I NEVER CARED FOR STROGANOFF
VLADIMIR: SHE SAID THAT LIKE A ROMANOV!
DIMITRI: THE SAMOVAR
VLADIMIR: THE CAVIAR
ANYA: DESSERT AND THEN GOODNIGHT!
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: NOT UNTIL YOU GET THIS RIGHT!
VLADIMIR: IF I CAN LEARN TO DO IT! YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT! PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER
DIMITRI: IF HE CAN LEARN TO DO IT YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: AND YOU’LL PULL THROUGH IT!
VLADIMIR: TELL YOURSELF IT’S EASY
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: AND IT’S TRUE! 
YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT TOO!
DIMITRI: (yells) YA-AH! ! !
(From nowhere, Vlad produces a huge chart- the family tree)
VLADIMIR: Next, you must memorize the names of all the royalty.
VLADIMIR: AND HERE WE, HAVE KROPOTKIN
DIMITRI: SHOT POTEMKIN
VLADIMIR: IN THE BOTKIN
ANYA: OH!
VLADIMIR: AND DEAR OLD UNCLE VANYA LOVED HIS VODKA
D’MITRI: GOT IT ANYA?

DIMITRI: SHORT!
VLADIMIR: COUNT ANATOLY
ANYA: HAD A …
VLADIMIR: WART!
D’MITRI: COUNT SERGEI 
WORE A FEATHERED HAT.
VLADIMIR: I HEAR HE’S GOTTEN VERY FAT.
ANYA: AND I RECALL HIS YELLOW CAT …
VLADIMIR: I DON’T BELIEVE WE TOLD HER THAT …
(Vlad and Dimitri exchange a baffled glance)
ANYA: (Proudly) IF YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT, I CAN LEARN TO DO IT!
VLADIMIR: DON’T KNOW HOW YOU KNEW IT.
ANYA: I SIMPLY KNEW IT! SUDDENLY I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE NEW IT!
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI : ANYA, YOU’RE A DREAM COME TRUE!
VLADIMIR:: IF I CAN LEARN TO DO IT! YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT! PULL YOURSELF 
TOGETHER
DIMITRI: IF HE CAN LEARN TO DO IT YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT
ALL THREE: AND YOU’LL PULL THROUGH IT! TELL YOURSELF IT’S EASY. AND IT’S TRUE—
VLAD &amp; DIMITRI: YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT.
ANYA: NOTHING TO IT!
ALL: YOU CAN LEARN TO DO IT TOO!

INT. 
HALLWAY OF THE SHIP DAY
(Dimitri hands a dress to Anya. It is several sizes too large.)
DIMITRI: Here. I bought you a dress 
ANYA: (holding it up, laughing) You bought me a tent.
(Pooka snickers as Anya pokes her head inside it.)
DIMITRI: What’re you looking for?
ANYA: (examining dress) The Russian Circus - I think it’s still in here.
(Dimitri doesn’t laugh.)
DIMITRI: Come on, just put it on. He walks away in a huff up the stairs,
DIMITRI: Agh.
(We see Anya holding up the dress, very pleased)
ANYA (excited): Hmm.
CROSS-DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DECK OF SHIP – NIGHT
Dimitri and Vlad are playing chess when Anya appears on deck wearing her new dress all fixed up. Vlad’s jaw drops.

VLADIMIR: Wonderkul! Marvelous! And now you are you’re dressed for a 
ball, you will learn to dance for one as well. Dimitri.
(Dimitri sees Anya’s incredible transformation.)
DIMITRI: But I’m not very good at it…
(Anya puts out her arms to dance. He awkwardly positions himself to dance with her. 
Vladimir counts off them into the waltz and then steps back to watch.)
VLADIMIR: And… one- two- three. One- two- three… No, no, Anya. You don’t lead. Let him.
(Waltz Music begins. Dimitri is nervous. They dance.)
DIMITRI: That dress is really beautiful.
ANYA: Do you think so?
DIMITRI: Yes. I mean it was nice on the hanger but it looks even better on you. Yo… you should wear it.
ANYA: I am wearing it.
DIMITRI: Oh, right of course, of course, you are. I’m just trying to give you’a…
ANYA: Compliment? 
DIMITRI: Of course, yes.
(She smiles. They swirl into the dance, at first awkward, but little by little gaining in grace. Vladimir watches them.)
(The sun is setting and it’s a glorious evening)
VLADIMIR: IT’S ONE-TWO-THREE 
AND SUDDENLY 
I SEE IT AT A GLANCE-- 
SHE’S RADIANT AND CONFIDENT AND BORN TO TAKE THIS CHANCE 
I TAUGHT HER WELL ‘ 
I PLANNED IT ALL! 
I JUST FORGOT … 
ROMANCE! 
VLAD, HOW COULD YOU DO THIS? HOW WILL WE GET THROUGH THIS? I NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET 
THEM DANCE!
(Anya and Dimitri gradually slow their dancing.)
ANYA: I’m feeling a little dizzy.
DIMITRI: Kind of light headed?
ANYA: Yeah.
DIMITRI: Me too. Probably from the spinning
(They’ve stopped dancing by now.)
DIMITRI: Maybe we should stop.
ANYA: We have stopped.
(Dimitri and Anya begin to fall into a kiss.)
DIMITRI: Anya, I …
ANYA: Yes … ?
(Pooka starts barking at Dimitri, breaking the spell.)
DIMITRI: You’re doing fine.
(Dimitri exits.)
(Anya watches him go, confused.)
CUT TO: 
INT. SHIP – NIGHT
Anya, Dimitri, Vladimir and Pooka are in a cabin. Dimitri is sound asleep, his backpack beside him on the floor. Anya is wrapped in a blanket. Vladimir is braced against the ship’s beams, not weathering the storm well.
ANYA: (whispering to Vladimir) Oh … are you all right?
VLADIMIR: Fine, fine. Just riddled with envy., Look at him, (INDICATING DIMITRI). He can sleep through anything.
(The ship tilts, timbers groaning. Pooka-climbs inside of Dimitri’s backpack knocking it over and The MUSIC BOX slides out of it and stops near Anya. She picks up the Music Box. Anya immediately has a sharp recollection, a shock. She cradles the box lovingly.)
ANYA: Gasp!
VLADIMIR: Pretty jewelry box, isn’t it?
ANYA: Jewelry box? Are you sure that’s what it is?
VLADIMIR: What else could it be?
ANYA: oh well, something else … Something special … something to do with a secret. (LAUGHS) Is that possible?
(ANGEL on Pooka, licking Anyals feet, wanting attention.)
(Vladimir climbs into his berth.)
(Anya laughs.)
VLADIMIR: Anything’s possible. You taught Dimitri how to waltz, didn’t you? …
(She secures the Music Box in the backpack.)
(Pooka begs at feet of Anya to be picked up. She picks him up. She climbs into her berth, Pooka climbs up on her tummy.)
VLADIMTR (CONT’D): … Sleep well, your majesty.
(Vladimir’s large body traps Pooka between him and Anya. Anya uses her foot to move Vlad so that Pooka can move. Pooka snuggles next to Anya.)
ANYA:Sweet dreams, Pooka.
EXT. UNDERWORLD 
CUT TO: NIGHT
(Rasputin and Bartok gaze at the image of Anastasia falling asleep.)
BARTOK: There she is master, sound asleep in her little bed.
RASPUTIN: And pleasant dreams to you, Princess. I’ll get inside your mind, where you can’t escape me. (As he says this , SMOKY IMAGES begin to collect around the Reliquary, images of faces, trees, a lake all blur together.)
(Rasputin chuckles with delight. He blows at the cloud of images sending them shooting skyward.)
CROSS DISSOLVE TO: 
SHIP’S CABIN – NIGHT
(From under the door SMOKY IMAGES silently slither. They move over toward Dimitri sleeping on the floor. Recognizing that he is not the right person they float across the cabin to her shoes then up over her berth and swirl around Anya.)
(CLOSE on Anya’s closed eyes as the Smoky Images wait for the opportunity to enter her mouth when she yawns. She smiles as Rasputin’s dream begins. Images of Butterflies appear and circle around her face.)

EXT. 
FOREST - DAY - IN HER DREAM

CUT TO: 
SHIP’S CABIN - REALITY

DIMITRI (OS CONT’D): Anya, stop!
(He grabs on to a rope line and swings out to rescue Anya about to leap to her death.)
EXT. FOREST - IN HER DREAM
(CLOSE on Anya in her dream. Nicholas waves for her to jump into the clear pond and join them. Anya nods and moves to jump in. Just as she is about to jump, Nicholas, face turns HIDEOUS AND FRIGHTENING, suddenly becoming Rasputin.)
DIMITRI: Anya, NO!
RASPUTIN: YES JUMP!!
(Rasputin continues to grow into an evil god-like figure as the dwarfed Anya rises on a column of skulls. Flying bat-like Minions swarm in a circle around Anya. She reacts in fear. A giant Rasputin towers over her on the column of skulls. His harpy-like Minions are grabbing at her, encouraging her to jump.)

DIMITRI: It was a nightmare. It’s all right, you’re safe now.
CUT TO: EXT. UNDERWORLD – NIGHT
(Rasputin watches the image-of Anya and Dlmitri’s embrace, seething. He moans, grasping his head in frustration, his fingers actually sinking into his skull. Rasputin’s neck is stretching and starting to tear as he pulls on his own head.)
(Bartok backs away from the impending explosion.)
RASPUTIN: (Screaming) No, Not again!
BARTOK: Easy, Master, wow… This is no time to loose your,head.
(Rasputin exerts a monumental effort to control himself.)
RASPUTIN: You’re right. (A SOOTHING MANTRA) I am calm. I am heartless. I have no feelings whatsoever.
BARTOK: Sir.
(Rasputin opens his eyes, suddenly smiling.)
RASPUTIN: I feel a sudden onset of clarity, Bartok. I’ll have to kill her myself. In person.
BARTOK: (amazed) What, you mean -- physically?
RASPUTIN” You know what they say. If you want something done right…
BARTOK: But that means … going topside?!
RASPUTIN: Exactly. I have so many fond memories of Paris and killing the last of the Romanovs with my own hands, will be so dee… licous. Well, time to go.
BARTOK: But you’re dead! You’re falling apart! Sir, how do you expect to get to Paris in one piece?
RASPUTIN: I thought we’d take the train. (LAUGHTER)

SOPHIE: Oh, oh dear now, you have to leave now, yes? Good-bye.
MARIE: (quietly) No more. No more…
(Sophie and the Tillie waddle back to Marie’s side. Sophie busies herself with a lavish preparation of tea.)
SOPHIE (CONT’D): Oh, oh… I must say I’m so sorry. I thought that one surely was real. Well, she was real I mean, she was human of course but not our real.
(She indicates a photo of Anastasia on the desk, then sets the tea cup down for the cat. Tillie sniffs the tea then turns up her nose.)
SOPHIE (CONT’D): … But we won’t be fooled next time! No, I’m going to think of really hard questions.
(She adds another lump of sugar to the cat’s tea. Satisfied, the cat drinks.)

CUT TO: 
INT. SOPHIE’S DRAWING ROOM
SOPHIE: Finally you’ll most likely find this an impertinent question, but indulge me. How did you escape during the siege of the palace?
(Dimitri and Vladimir exchange a nervous look. It’s obvious they never briefed Anya on this one. Anya is silent for a moment, then:
ANYA: There was a boy, a boy who worked in the palace. He opened a wall -- (realizes what she’s said) I’m sorry, that’s crazy -- (on a lighter note, trying to recover) 
walls opening…
(Dimitri is shocked. He knows this is Anastasia Romanov and he can’t believe it. He wanders outside. Anya does not see him.)
VLADIMIR: So… Is she a Romanov?
SOPHIE: Oh well, she answered every question…
(Anya’s face lights up.)
VLADIMIR: You hear that, child… You did it!
(Anya hugs Vlad. Sophie smiles.)
VLADIMIR: So, when do we go and see the Empress?
SOPHIE: I’m afraid you don’t.
VLADIMIR: Come again, my pet.
SOPHIE: The Empress simply won’t allow it.
VLADIMIR: Now Sophie, my bright diamond. Surely you can think of some way to arrange a brief interview with the Dowanger. I refuse to budge till an answer occurs to you.
VLADIMIR: Please.
(Sophie thinks - then:)
SOPHIE: Do you like the Russian ballet? I believe they’re performing in Paris tonight - the Dowanger Empress and I love the Russian Ballet - we never miss it.

(Dimitri turns to him, still dumbfounded, and desperately repeats a line he’s said man time without meaning.)
DIMITRI: But Vlad, Vlad, Vlad she is the princess.
(Of course, Vlad thinks he means that Anya just did well.)
VLADIMIR: Anya was extraordinary. I almost believed her and Sophie.

(Anya is very nervous, she watches Marie instead of the Ballet. She tears up her program. Dimitri reaches over and takes her hand.)
DIMITRI: Everything’s gonna be fine.
INTERMISSION
(The lights come up, Dimitri turns to Anya.)
DIMITRI: (bittersweet) Come on. I guess it’s time. 
Relax you’re gonna be great.
(Anya goes to turn away.)
DIMITRI: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey take a deep breath everything’s gonna be fine.
CROSS DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MEZZANINE -- MINUTES LATER
(They approach Marie’s private balcony.)
DIMITRI: Wait here just a moment. I’ll go in and announce you properly.
(Anya stops him.)
ANYA: Dimitri.
DIMITRI: Yes?
ANYA: Look, we’ve been through a lot together…
DIMITRI: Uh-huh.
ANYA (CONT’D): … and I just wanted to…
DIMITRI: Yes?
ANYA: …well, thank you I guess. Yes, thank you for everythiing.
(Dimitri takes his leave, then turns back.)
DIMITRI: Anya, I…
ANYA: Yes?
DIMITRI: I’m... I... Um...
ANYA: Yes?
DIMITRI: I wanted to wish you good luck…… Well… here goes.

INT. PRIVATE BALCONY
(Dimitri approaches Sophie.)
DIMITRI: Please inform her majesty, The Dowanger Empress, that I have found her granddaughter…
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE BALCONY, Anya listening to Dimitri from the other side of the door, near bursting.
DIMITRI (OS CONT’D): … the Grand Duchess Anastasia. She’s waiting to see her just outside the door.
CUT TO: 
INT. PRIVATE BALCONY
SOPHIE: I’m very sorry young man but the Dowanger Empress, she will see no one.
(Overhearing this, Marie turns around and faces Dimitri. Rage burns in her face.)
MARIE: You may tell that impertinent young man that I have seen enough Grand Duchess Anastasias to last me a lifetime.
(Sophie has second thoughts and wants Dimitri to leave.)
SOPHIE: Um, you better go.
DIMITRI: Please, let me just…
MARIE: Now if you’ll excuse me I wish to live the remainder of my lonely life in peace.
SOPHIE: Come, I’ll see you to the door. Come, come now, come to the door.
(Sophie closes the curtain that accesses Marie, but Dimitri ducks through it and sits himself down in a chair NEXT TO THE DOWANGER.)
DIMITRI: Your majesty, I intend you no harm. My name is Dimitri… I used to work at the palace.
MARIE: Well, that’s one I haven’t heard, I must say.
(She rises to go.)
DIMITRI: Wait, don’t go please if you’ll just hear me out.
MARIE: I know what you’re after. I’ve seen it before! Men who train young women in the royal ways.
(Marie pulls on a velvet rope summoning the guards.)
DIMITRI: But if your highess will… just listen.
MARIE: (interrupts) Haven’t you been listening? I’ve had enough. I don’t care how much you have fashioned this girl to look like her, sound like her or act like her. In the end, it never is her!
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE BALCONY - Anya, who can’t believe what she is hearing.
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE BALCONY
DIMITRI: This time it is her!
MARIE: Dimitri, I’ve heard of you. You’re that con man from St. Petersburg, who was holding auditions to find an Anastasia look-a-like.
ANYA: Gasp!
DIMITRI: But your grace, we’ve come all the way from Russia just to see you…
MARIE: And others have come from Timbuktu.
DIMITRI: No, it’s not that, it’s not what you think.
MARIE: (to guards) How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money?
CUT TO: 
OUTSIDE THE BALCONY
(Anya horrified and ashamed as she realizes the truth about Dimitri and herself.)
MARIE (OS CONT’D): Remove him at once!
CUT TO: 
INSIDE THE BALCONY
DIMITRI: But she is Anastasia, I’m telling you, she’s the Grand Duchess. If you’ll only speak to her, you’ll see!
(Dimitri is thrown out of the box and lands at Anya’s feet, who stares at him with agonizing realization.)
ANYA: (devastated) It was all a lie, wasn’t it?
DIMITRI: No, no…
ANYA: You used me… I, I was just a part of your con to get her money!
DIMITRI: No, no, no, no.... look it may have started out that way but everything’s different now, because you really are Anastasia, you are.
ANYA: No… Stop it! From the very beginning you lied… and I not only believed you, I, I actually… Argh!
DIMITRI: Anya, please. When you spoke of the hidden door of the wall opening and the little boy… listen to me that was…
ANYA: NO! I don’t want to hear about anything I said or remembered! You just leave me alone!
(Dimitri grabs Anya’s arm and she slaps him… then she turns and runs off, Dimitri follows her, but gets caught up in the crowd.)
DIMITRI: Anya please. You have to know the truth.
CROSS DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PARIS OPERA
(Long shot Paris Opera House. Marie coming out the door down the steps. Dimitri is still standing on the steps when he sees her.)
(Dimitri’s POV as Marie is walking toward the car. A very proper CHAUFFER helps Marie in.)
(Dimitri slides into the drivers seat and roars away, the stunned Chauffer left standing in the dust.)
CHAUFFER: Your majesty!!
INT. CAR
(Marie is jolted by the fast motion of the car.)
CHAUFFER: Stop right now! Come back here!
MARIE: Ilya! Slow down!
(Dimitri turns from the front seat and looks at her.)
DIMITRI: I’m not Ilya and I won’t slow down. Not until you listen.
MARIE: (recognizing Dimitri) You! How dare you?! Stop this car immediately! Stop this car!
(The car slams to a stop in front of Sophie’s House. Dimitri gets out of the car and goes around to Marie’s door and opens it.)
DIMITRI: You have to talk to her! Just look at her. Please.
MARIE: I won’t be badgered by you a moment longer.
DIMITRI: Do you reconize this?
(Dimitri thrusts the MUSIC BOX into her hands. Marie is taken aback. Dimitri has her attention. Marie holds the music box against her chest tightly. She gasps.)
MARIE: Oh, where did you get this?
DIMITRI: (softer) I know you’ve been hurt. But it’s just possible that she’s been as lost and alone as you.
MARIE: You’ll stop at nothing will you?
DIMITRI: I’m probably about as stubborn as you are.
CUT TO: 
INT. SOPHIE’S HOUSE - A MOMENT LATER
(Anya is packing to leave Paris. There is a knocking at the door.)
ANYA: (angrily packing): Go away, Dimitri…
(We hear the door open. Anya turns to see Marie.)
ANYA (CONT’D): Oh, I’m sorry. I… I thought you were…
MARIE: I know very well who you thought I was. Who exactly are you?
ANYA: Eh… I … I was hoping you could tell me.
MARIE: (sighs) My dear, I’m old and I’m tired of being conned and tricked.
ANYA: I don’t want to trick you.
MARIE: And I suppose the money doesn’t interest you either?
ANYA: I just want to know who I am whether or not I belong to a family, your family.
(Marie stands.)
MARIE: You’re a very good actress. The best yet, in fact. But I’ve had enough.
(Marie sweeps past Anya. Anya catches a scent of something.)
ANYA: Peppermint…
(Marie pauses. Still suspicious.)
MARIE: An oil for my hands.
(Anya closes her eyes, the memories flooding back.)
ANYA: Yes… I spilled a bottle… The carpet was soaked. And it forever smelled of peppermint. (LOOKS AT MARIE) Like you
(Marie is staring at Anya, stopped dead. Anya continues, surprising even herself.)
ANYA: I used to lie there on the rug and oh how I missed you when you went away… When you came here. To Paris.
(Marie notices Anya playing with a key around her neck.)
MARIE: What is that?
ANYA: This well, I’ve always had it… Ever since before I can remember.
UNDERSCORE: "THE MUSIC BOX"
MARIE: May I?
(Marie holds out her hands as Anya takes off the key and hands it to her. Marie takes the Music Box from her evening bag.)
MARIE (CONT’D): (through tears) It was our secret. My Anastasia’s and mine…
(Anya begins humming the lullaby, then the music box begins to play. Marie is surprised that Anya knows how it works - is is Anastasia!)
ANYA (CONT’D): (singing, broken with emotion) (THE WORDS TO THE LULLABY FROM THE PROLOGUE)
(Tears stream down Marie’s face as she joins Anya in the lullaby.)
ANYA &amp; MARIE: Here this song and remember 
soon you’ll be home with me 
Once Upon a December
(Their cracking voices trail off as they look at each other and know that their search is finally over. Anya and Marie throw their arms around each other in an emotional embrace.)
MARIE: Oh Anastasia! My Anastasia!
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARIS STREET OUTSIDE SOPHIE’S HOUSE - SAME NIGHT
PAN DOWN to Dimitri on street looking up at the window, he blows a kiss and turns to walk away.
CUT TO: 
INT. CLOCK TOWER IN THE CITY OF PARIS
(Bartok is sitting on a table. Rasputin walking down the stairs, walking, excited.)
RASPUTIN: Bartok! Get me a comb… find some cologne! I want to look my best.
BARTOK: That might take some work, sir.
RASPUTIN: Then snap to it. We’re going to a party.
BARTOK: A party in Paris?
RASPUTIN: That’s right.
(Bartok is so excited he starts moving his hips to the music.)
BARTOK: Ooh, I could teach you all the latest dance steps. It starts with, like a wooh, then you get really crazy with the hips sir. It’s fun.
RASPUTIN: (ignoring him) We’ll let the Grand Duchess Anastasia have her moment.
BARTOK: (carefree) But who cares?
RASPUTIN: And then we’ll kill her!
BARTOK: Right, and then, Kill Her? (CONFUSED) Sir, what happened to the party idea?
RASPUTIN: That’s where we’re going to kill her. Crush her at the height of her glory.
BARTOK: (miserably) And we’re back to the crushing. (ON HIS KNEES) Sir, I’m begging you please…. pleeeaze: Forget the girl, and get a life.
RASPUTIN: Oh, I’ll get a life, Bartok. HERS!
CUT TO: 
INT MARIE’S STUDY - NIGHT
(The music box is on Marie’s desk beside an unopened jewelry box. Marie sits on a sofa, a large simple wooden box open beside her. Anya sits on a hammock at her feet, looking at an informal photograph of her family, touching the faces slowly with her fingertips, tears welling up in her eyes. Marie gently takes the picture from behind her, stroking her hair.)
ANYA: I remember now, how much I loved them.
MARIE: They would not want us to live in the past, not now that we have found each other. Oh look here -- (taking a water color from the box) The drawings you gave me -- Remember?
ANYA: (taking the picture) Yes! Olga made me so mad -- she said it looked like a pig riding a donkey! She was right!
(Her voice bubbles with laughter.)
MARIE: In your laughter, once again I hear my Nicky, your dear father…
(She stands and leads Anya to the jewel box, opening it. Displayed in rich velvet is a dazzling array of jewelry. Anya gasps.
MARIE (CONT’D): But you have the beauty of your mother, Alexandra, Empress of all Russia.
(Marie takes the exquisite tiara from the box and places it on ANYA’s head, turning her to look in the mirror. Wide-eyed, ANYA sees that she looks like a princess indeed. From her C.U.:
CROSS DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ANYA’S BEDROOM IN SOPHIE’S HOUSE -- DAY
(The same crown, the same wide-eyed expression, but now as we pull back from the reflection in this mirror, Sophie and a SEAMSTRESS are just stepping back, rapturous, making final adjustments, and revealing Anya in her exquisite gown. Anya turns slightly, watching herself, touching the gown in wonder.)
CUT TO: 
INT. MARIE’S STUDY - DAY
(Dimitri stands before Marie and an open valise filled with the reward money.)
DIMITRI: You sent for me, your Grace?
MARIE: Ten million rubles… As promised, with my gratitude.
DIMITRI: I accept your gratitude. Your Highness. But I don’t want the money.
(Marie smiles.)
MARIE: (a bit suspicious) What do you want, then?
DIMITRI: Unfortunately nothing you can give (BOWS)
(He starts to leave, Marie is puzzled and intrigued.)
MARIE: Young man. (HE STOPS) Where did you get that music box?
(Dimitri doesn’t answer. She crosses to him.)
MARIE (CONT’D): You were the boy, weren’t you? The servant boy who got us out. You saved her life, and mine. Then you restored her to me, yet you want no reward?
DIMITRI: Not anymore.
MARIE: Why the change of mind?
DIMITRI: It was more a change of heart. (ALMOST FLEEING) I must go.
(Dimitri bows and leaves quickly. Marie is left wondering.)
CROSS DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HALLWAY OF MARIE’S HOUSE - DAY
(Anya sees Dimitri coming down the steps. She draws herself to full regal height. He stops when he sees her.)
ANYA: (distantly) Hello, Dimitri.
DIMITRI: Hello.
ANYA: Did you collect your reward?
DIMITRI: My business is complete.
MAJOR DOMO: Eh, young man you will bow and address the Princess as "Your Highness."
ANYA: No, that’s not nec…
(Dimitri raises his hand to stop her. He BOWS.)
DIMITRI: Please, your Highness. I’m glad you found what you were looking for.
ANYA: Yes, I’m glad you did too.
DIMITRI: Well, then… Goodbye. (ADDING) Your Highness.
(He bows and exits. Anya stares after him for a moment.)
ANYA: (softly, to herself.) Goodbye…
CUT TO: 
INT. MARIE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON
(Vladimir is looking in the mirror admiring himself. He is in full fancy dress for the coronation. Pooka enters in full fancy dress wearing a crown, a medal and a sword. Vladimir sees that Pooka looks and feels miserable.)
VLADIMIR: (to Pooka, re: the dog’s clothes) You look fabulous. Oh, do you mind?
(Vladimir steals the medal from around Pooka’s neck and pins it on his own chest.)
VLADIMIR (CONT’D): No, of course not, you’re a wonderful dog.
(Dimitri enters and picks up his travel bag. Vlad sees his reflection in the mirror and turns.)
DIMITRI: Well if you’re ever in St. Petersburg again look me up. So long, Vlad.
(Vladimir hugs Dimitri.)
VLADIMIR: Oh, my boy, you’re making a mistake.
DIMITRI: Trust me, this is the one thing I’m doing right.
(Forcing a smile, Dimitri cuts Vlad off, shaking his hand and patting him on the shoulder. Pooka understands that Dimitri is leaving, he whimpers. Dimitri scratches his nose.)
DIMITRI: So long mutt.
(Pooka licks Dimitri’s hand)
DIMITRI: I can’t stay. I don’t belong here.
(Dimitri exits.)
CUT TO: 
INT. GRAND PALAIS - NIGHT
(Couples in splendor, waltz on the floor while guests whisper excitedly about Anastasia appearing. Many of them were at the opening ball in St. Petersburg. An ORNATE CHIR sits alone on an empty stage - waiting for the Princess.)
CUT TO: 
INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
(Anya looks through the curtaiin at the dancing crowd, looking for Dimitri, knowing he’s not there. Marie watches Anya.)
MARIE: He’s not there.
ANYA: Oh, I know he’s not, he --
(She’s caught. She tries to cover, badly.)
ANYA (CONT’D): Who’s not there, Grandmama?…
MARIE: A remarkable young man who found a music box…
ANYA: No he’s probably too busy spending his reward money as fast as he can.
MARIE: Look at them dance! You were born to this world of glittering jewels and fine titles, but I wonder if this is what you really want.
ANYA: Of course, of course it is. I found what I was looking for. I found out who I am. I found you.
(She doesn’t sound happy. She turns to Marie, and now her voice is filled with real warmth.)
MARIE (CONT’D): Yes you did find me, and you’ll always have me. But is it enough?
(They embrace.)
MARIE: My darling ---
(For a moment Marie just holds her. There are tears in her eyes. She knows she has to tell Anya the truth. She pulls away, looks at Anya, and sighs.)
MARIE (CONT’D): … he didn’t take the money.
(Anya looks at her in shock.)
ANYA: He… didn’t?…
MARIE (CONT’D): Knowing that you are alive, seeing the woman you have become, brings me joy I never thought I could feel again.
(Anya embraces her again, resting her head on Marie’s shoulder. Marie turns Anya gently, pulling back the curtain to look OUT AT THE CROWD.)
MARIE (CONT’D): Whatever you choose, we will always have each other.
ANYA: (turning agin) Grandmama, can’t you tell me --
(But Marie is gone. Anya looks at the CROWD. She straightens her shoulders, pushes the curtain a little farther back -- but suddenly she hears Pooka’s HYSTERICAL BARKING. She turns to see him just disappearing through the terrace doors.
ANYA (CONT’D): Pooka?
(She hurries out to the Terrace.)
CUT TO: 
EXT. TULERIES GARDEN DOOR - NIGHT
(A shadow moves through the garden door. Slithering into the darkness like the crafty Serpent of Eden.)
ANOTHER ANGLE: 
Pooka barks in the darkness. He edges her further out into the topiary garden. Towering hedges in the shape of horses, elephants and giraffes suurpind him.He disappears.
ANOTHER ANGLE: 
Anya appears in the doorway, worried A beat. Pooka BARKS (OS). Confused, she hikes up her gown and heads after him.
ANOTHER ANGLE: Anya submerges herself deeper and deeper into the darkness, leaving the light and cheer of the party behind. The BARKING continues into the distance (OS).
ANYA: (worried) Pooka? Pooka?….
(As she wanders further into the topiary garden we notice something odd: the SHADOWS are moving in her wake!)
CUT TO: 
INT. TRAIN STATION - SAME TIME
(Dimitri is next in the ticket time. He fishes in his pocket for money, comes up with the FLOWER.)
(CLOSE on Dimitri staring at the flower. Thinking of Anya.)
VOICE (OS): You’re next.
(Dimitri turns to the TICKET WOMAN, tormented with indescision.)
CUT TO: 
EXT. GARDEN - SAME TIME
(Moving shadows. Anya’s silhouette passes through a moonbeam. She is no longer worried. She is scared. For a moment, Pooka’s barking stops (OS). Ticking silence. Anya is lost in the topiary garden. Alone. She senses a presence. A bark! Anya spins in circles, desprearley trying to orient herself. She sees Pooka! Barking at the bushes around him.)
ANYA: Pooka? … Here boy!
(Pooka keeps barking! Anya whirls about to face -- A TOPIARY BUSH. Blocking her way out. She frowns: it wasn’t there before!)
ANYA (CONT’D): There you are.
(She spins: ANOTHER TOPIARY BUSH blocks her path. It wasn’t there before! Pooka barks wildly!)
(She whirls around: the Topiary Bushes have moved again. Pooka barks.)
(ANOTHER ANGLE: Anya spins! -- The Topiary Bushes are rearranged, casting long shadows across her face like groping fingers. She is trapped, boxed in. Pooka barks as the green creatures seem ready to spring at her.)
RASPUTIN (OS): An-a-sta-sia… Anastasia
(Anya gulps, her eyes wide. Who said that? She firmly grabs her gown and makes a run for it through a small opening. Pooka follows, barking at all sides.)
(She pushes through to come upon…)
THE BRIDGE
(Where they come to a top)
EXT. TUILERIES GARDEN - NIGHT
(ANYA in the garden.)
RASPUTIN (OS): Anastasia.
(She turns to face…)
(Rasputin. A silhouette in the moonlight. Hunched over. Atrophied. Holding the glowing Reliquary. He steps closer. Rasputin bows cynically, cruelly.)
RASPUTIN: Your Imperial Highness. Look what ten years has done to us: you a beautiful young flower and me a rotting corpse.
ANYA: That face!
RASPUTIN: Last seen at a party like this one.
ANYA: A curse….
(He ominously raises the Reliquary. Bartok peeks out from Rasputin’s beard, then hides.)
RASPUTIN: Followed by a tragic night on the ice. REMEMBER?! 
(WHOOSH! -- Rasputin fires a stream of crackling smoke from the Reliquary! It ices over the bridge and everyhing around it! The stone CHERUB faces twist horribly, they grow fangs, ears are pointed, they become devilish imps!)
(Anya is thrown to the ground by the blast. She picks herself up. Now she remembers.)
ANYA: Rasputin!
RASPUTIN: (imitating, mocking) "Rasputin!" Destroyed by your despicable family! But what goes around comes around!
(He bursts out in laughter as he raises the Reliquary. Anya stands frozen in terror, unsure of what comes next. Smoke billows out.)
(Minions take shape from the smoke! They swarm toward Anya like a pack of locusts as we hear the flapping of thousands of wings, They taunt her, poke her, tear her dress, steal her crown! Spinning in circles!)
RASPUTIN (CONT’D): And around! And around! And around! And around!
ANYA: Stop no, get away. No, no…
(Rasputin laughs gleefully. Her terror brings him joy. The Minions begin to push Anya toward the bridge. Her back arches against the side, about to tip over. Pooka’s eyes are huge.)
(Anya bats her arms, fighting them, hitting them. The Minions squawk like the cowards they are and suddenly dissipate back into smoke. Gone, disappeared.)
(Bartok flies up to the Pegasus and perches there safely.)
BARTOK: You’re on your own, Sir. This can only end in tears.
(Anya locks her eyes onto Rasputin’s. She takes a step forward, facing him in all his horror. Rasputin smiles but cannot betray a hint of surprise.)
ANYA: I’m not afraid of you.
RASPUTIN: I can fix that! Care for a little swim under the ice?
(WHOOSH! -- Smoke shoots from the Reliquary. Cracks race across the bridge like lightning bolts.)
(WHOOSH! -- The bridge creaks and moans hideously!)
(WHOOSH! -- A blast of snow and ice slams into Anya like a fist, throwing her backwards as she slides down the side! Rasputin laughs.)
RASPUTIN (CONT’D): Say your prayers, Anastasia! NO ONE CAN SAVE YOU!
DIMITRI (OS): WANNA BET?!?
(Rasputin spins to see Dimitri charging him. Dimitri punches him in the face. Rasputin spins and the Reliquary shoots again, blasting the bridge. Anya falls further downward as pieces of the bridge crumble. Dimitri leaps over the side after her. Rasputin looks over the side at them.)
(Anya struggles to grasp his hand. Their eyes meet.)
ANYA: Dimitri! If we live through this remind me to thank you.
(Rasputin stares down at them over the side.)
DIMITRI: You can thank me later.
RASPUTIN: How enchanting, "together again", for the last TIME!
(Rasputin fires his Reliquary! A swarm of Minions blast Dmitri into the air, higher and higher and right onto the PEGASUS!)
RASPUTIN (CONT’D): You’ll get a kick out of this!
(The Pegasus springs to life and majestically leaps off it’s column with Dimitri on it!)
ANYA: Noo…
(It bucks Dimitri off it’s back, sending him through the air. Dimitri lands on the bridge. The Pegasus attacks him, rearing and neighing. Dimitri struggles to roll away.)
(Meanwhile, Anya climbs up the bridge. Dimitri glances down to see her.)
DIMITRI: Wow!
ANYA: Dimitri!
RASPUTIN: Taha!
DIMITRI: Anya, Watch Out!
(The Pegasus chases Dimitri until he falls to a ledge.)
(Meanwhile, Anya has climbed to the edge. She sees Dimitri. Rasputin suddenly grabs her.)
RASPUTIN: Dasvidanya, your Highness.
(He throws her down, sending her back over the edge. She struggles to hang on with both hands.)
DIMITRI: Hold on!
RASPUTIN: Finally, the last Romanov death!
(Rasputin laughs as Anya looks side ward to see another way up. Suddenly Pooka bites Rasputin;s ankle! Rasputin screeches! He turns back to see Anya gone and assumes she has fallen. He blasts the Reliquary over the side for good measure.)
RASPUTIN: Ya, ha, ha!
DIMITRI: No! ANYA!
(Dimitri leaps off the bridge after Anya. The Pegasus charges after him. Dimitri grabs its reigns and hangs on in mid-air as it carries him aloft.)
(Rasputin looks down to see nothing but a cloud of ice and smoke.)
RASPUTIN: Long live the Romanovs!
(Anya steps through the smoke!!)
ANYA: Right, I couldn’t have said it better myself!
(Anya lunges at Rasputin, butting him head-on! They fall to the ground and struggle t grasp the Reliquary, which rolls across the bridge. Rasputin grabs it and shoots a stream of Minions at Anya. She tumbles backwards. Suddenly Pooka leaps up and grabs the Reliquary in his mouth. The Minions around Anya dissipate into smoke!)
RASPUTIN: AAAAGGGHHH!
(Pooka leaps away with it, trips, and the Reliquary falls right at Anya’s foot. Rasputin cowers. His power is gone.)
(Anya hears a horse whinny and looks over to see Dimitri lying still, perhaps dead, beneath the horse. She is furious!
ANYA: This is for Dimitri… Ah…
RASPUTIN: Give it back!
ANYA: This is for my family!
RASPUTIN: I’ll tear you to pieces!!
(She stomps the Reliquary!)
(Cracks form. The Pegasus suddenly crumbles to pieces! Rasputin screams as she strikes it again! He leaps for it. It is too late; Anya whacks it again with her foot!)
ANYA: And this, this is for you!
RASPUTIN: No!
(Anya, smashes the Reliquary to bits.)
ANYA (CONT’D): Dosvidanya!
<b>Rasputin</b>: AAAGGGHHH!!!
(KABOOM! -- IT EXPLODES! Anya leaps back as a green light sprays into Rasputin, beginning with his fingers a coursing into him like an electric current. Like a beacon in the night. A lighthouse attracting the denizens of hell, who arrive, wings beating him down… enveloping him… circling him.)
(His skin glows. It shimmers. Then it starts to melt off him! Leaving nothing but a rattling, screaming skeleton! The skeleton cracks, unhinges, the skull keeps screaming! The bones fall apart and crumble to dust as the Minions fly away, and the dust starts blowing away in the wind.)
CUT TO:
(Anya hurries over to Dimitri, who lies there, still as death. She gently strokes his hair.)
<b>Anya</b>: Ooh… Oh no… Dimitri…
(Suddenly he growns!)
<b>Anya (upon hearing Dimitri)</b>: (Gasps!)
<b>Dimitri</b>: Ouch!
<b>Anya</b>: Dimitri! Oh!
<b>Dimitri</b>: Ow, ow, ow, ow… Oh no let go. Let go, easy.
<b>Anya</b>: Sorry!
(Dimitri picks himself up as Anya pulls back. He smiles.)
<b>Dimitri</b>: Yeah, I know. I know. All men are babies!
(Suddenly their faces move closer together. Both are so happy the other is alive that their love can’t help but sputter out…)
<b>Anya</b>: I thought you were going to St. Peter……
<b>Dimitri</b>: I was…
<b>Anya</b>: You didn’t take the…
<b>Dimitri</b>: I couldn’t.
<b>Anya</b>: Why?
<b>Dimitri</b>: Because… I…
(Their lips are about to meet when Pooka barks (OS). The romantic spell is broken.)
(They pull apart to see Pooka with the crown in his mouth. Dimitri takes it and hands it to Anya.)
<b>Dimitri</b>: Oh… they’re waiting for you.
(Anya looks at him, at the crown. At him. The crown.)
INT. GRAND PALAIS GREEN ROOM - NIGHT
(A hat box sits opened on a table. The crown sits next to it. Sophie cries tears of joy as she stares at the note that came with it.)
<b>Anya (OS)</b>: Dear Grandmama, wish me luck. We’ll be together in Paris again soon. A bientot.
<b>Sophie</b>: They’ve eloped. Isn’t it romantic. It’s a perfect ending.
(Vlad enters the room. Marie, regal and wise, stares out a window at a distant boat on the Seine.)
<b>Marie</b>: No it’s a perfect beginning.
(Marie wipes away a tear before Sophie can see it. She gives the boat one last look: happy and sad, then turns to go.
CUT TO:
EXT. RIVERBOAT - NIGHT
(Dimitri and Anya are dancing on the riverboat.)
<b>Anya</b>: (Laughter)
(Finally, Anya and Dimitri kiss. Pooka blushes.)
(PAN UP to see BARTOK imitating their dancing. Suddenly a female bat flies down and joins him. He’s shy. She takes the upper hand and kisses him.)
<b>Bartok</b>: Ah hello. (<i>Kiss</i>) Wow! I tell you what WOW (<i>giggles</i>) So long everybody! Ah ah!!!!
(<i>As Bartok says his line, he pulls the shade down.</i>)
FADE OUT: THE END
