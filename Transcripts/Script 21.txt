(<i>In a nighttime street, the peddler slides off his camel and addresses us)</i>
[camel panting]
Peddler: Ah, salaam, and good evening to you, worthy friend. Please, please, come closer. (<i>Camera zooms in hitting peddler in face</i>) Too close. A little too close. (<i>Pulls his face just a little further from the camera</i>) There. Welcome to Agrabah, city of mystery, of enchantment, (<i>Opens the pouch on his camel which transforms into a bazaar stall)</i> and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today. Come on down. Heh, heh. Look at this. Yes. Combination hookah and coffeemaker. Also makes julienne fries. Will not break. (<i>taps it on table</i>) will not… (<i>it falls apart</i>) It broke. Ohh! Look at this. (<i>Pulls out Tupperware</i>) I have never seen one of these intact before. This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen. (<i>Pries it open, makes raspberry sound.</i>) Ah, still good. (<i>Camera begins to pan to right. The peddler hurries to catch it.</i>) Wait, don’t go! (<i>Stop pan.</i>) I can see that you’re only interested in the exceptionally rare. I think, then, you would be most rewarded to consider this. (<i>The peddler pulls the iconic magic lamp out from his sleeve.</i>) Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance. Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts. (<i>Another pan, this one slower to left. Again, the peddler rushes to catch up.</i>) This is no ordinary lamp! It once changed the course of a young man’s life. A young man who, liked this lamp, was more than what he seemed. A diamond in the rough. Perhaps you would like to hear the tale? (<i>The peddler pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand</i><small><i>.</i></small>) It begins on a dark night… (<i>The peddler throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.</i>) where a dark man waits with a dark purpose.
<i>(Camera tilts down to find Jafar sitting on his horse and Iago on his shoulder. Gazeem comes riding up to the pair.)</i>
[horse nickers]
Jafar: You are late.
Gazeem: A thousand apologies, O Patient One.
Jafar: You have it then?
Gazeem: I had to slit a few throats, but I got it. (<i>Pulls out half of the medallion. Jafar reaches out for it, but Gazeem yanks it back.</i>) Ah-ah-ahhh. The treasure. (<i>Iago squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.</i>) Ow!
Jafar: Trust me, my pungent friend. You'll get what's coming to you.
Iago: What's coming to you. Awk!
<i>(Jafar pulls out the second half of the medallion. He connects them, forming a golden scarab. It comes to life and flies away.)</i>
Jafar: Quickly! Follow the trail!
<i>(On horseback, the trio chase the medallion across the moonlit desert)</i>
Faster!
(<i>The creature splits in two, each half lodging into a sand dune. A towering tiger's head rises from the dune. The pieces of the scarab form its glowing eyes. The men's horses rear on their hind legs, throwing their riders off. Jafar grins as the tiger head opens it cavernous mouth.)</i>
[horse neighs]
[wind howling]
Jafar: At last, after all my years of searching, the Cave of Wonders.
Iago: Awk. Cave of Wonders!
Gazeem: (<i>whispering</i>) By Allah...
Jafar: Now, remember. Bring me the lamp! The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp... is mine. [chuckles]
(<i>Gazeem starts to approach the lion’s mouth, which forms the entrance to the cave. He chuckles as he goes.</i>)
Iago: Awk, the lamp. Awk, the lamp. (<i>Now that Iago and Jafar are alone, Iago opens up in normal English.</i>) Jeez, where'd ya dig this bozo up?
(<i>Jafar puts his finger to his lips and shushes him. Gazeem creeps towards the oral entrance of the cave. He peers inside of the mouth as its tongue morphs into a staircase. He tip toes around one of the tiger's fangs, but is blown away by the roar of the cave’s speaking.</i>)
Cave: [echoing rumble] <b>Who disturbs my slumber?</b>
Gazeem: [thief gasps] It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.
Cave: <b>Know this. Only one may enter here... one whose worth lies far within. A diamond in the rough.</b>
(<i>Gazeem turns to Jafar with a questioning look.</i>)
Jafar: What are you waiting for? Go on.
[beast sighing]
(<i>Gazeem hesitates, then moves one foot inside the cave. With great apprehension, he plants his foot down. Nothing happens. Relieved, he begins his trek again. Then another roar comes. He turns back, but the lion’s mouth slams shut and the dune collapses back to normal. All that are left are Jafar, Iago, and the 2 separated halves of the medallion.</i>)
Jafar: NOOOOOOO!
Cave: Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.
Iago: [coughing] I can't believe it. I just don't believe it! We're never gonna get a hold of that stupid lamp! Just forget it! Look at this. Look at this. I'm so tickled off that I'm molting. (<i>He flies up to Jafar's shoulder.</i>)
Jafar: Patience, Iago. Patience. Gazeem was obviously less than worthy.
Iago: (<i>extremely sarcastic)</i> Oh, there's a big surprise. That's an incredi- I think I'm gonna have a heart attack and die from <i>that</i> surprise. What are we gonna do? We got a big problem here, a big- (<i>Jafar pinches his beak shut.</i>)
Jafar: Yes. Only one may enter. I must find this one, this... diamond in the rough.
(<i>Cut to a rooftop, where Aladdin rushes up to the edge, carrying a loaf of bread. He almost drops it over the edge.</i>)
Razoul: Stop! Thief! I'll have your hands for a trophy, street rat!
Aladdin: (<i>Looks back, then down, then at the bread.</i>) All this for a loaf of bread? Whoooaa!
(<i>He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them. He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes. Finally, he’s nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed. Aladdin slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.

Aladdin: Morning, ladies.
Woman 1: Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we, Aladdin?
Aladdin: Trouble? No way. You're only in trouble if you get caught.

Razoul: Gotcha!
Aladdin: I'm in trouble.
Razoul: And this time... (<i>A screeching sound from Abu, then the guard’s turban is pulled down over his eyes. Abu points on the guard’s head, laughing.</i>)

Abu: Ah, don’t. Huh?
(ABU sees ALADDIN walking into the daylight, where there is a parade <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">going on.ALADDIN peers over the shoulders of people. He sees </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">PRINCE ACHMED riding on a horse.)</span>
BYSTANDER 1: On his way to the palace, I suppose.
BYSTANDER 2: Another suitor for the princess.

ACHMED: Oh--I teach you some manners!

ALADDIN: Look at that, Abu. It’s not every day you see a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">horse with two rear ends!</span>

ACHMED: Good luck marrying her off.
SULTAN: Oh, Jasmine. Jasmine! Jasmine! (The SULTAN goes <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">off into the garden looking for his daughter.

JASMINE: Oh, father. Rajah was just playing with him,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> weren’t you Rajah. (RAJAH comes over and allows</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> JASMINE to pet and hug him.)

SULTAN: Dearest, you’ve got to stop rejecting every suitor <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">that comes to call. The law says you…</span>
BOTH: …must be married to a prince.
(They walk over to a dove cage.)
SULTAN: By your next birthday.
JASMINE: The law is wrong.
SULTAN: You’ve only got three more days!
JASMINE: Father, I hate being forced into this. (She takes <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">a dove out of the cage and pets it.) If I do marry, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">I want it to be for love.</span>
SULTAN: Jasmine, it’s not only this law. (She hands him<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the dove, and he puts it back in the cage.) I’m not</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> going to be around forever, and I just want to make </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">sure you’re taken care of, provided for.</span>
JASMINE: Please try to understand. I’ve never done a thing on my own. (She swirls her finger in the water of the pond, petting the fish.) I’ve never had any real friends. (RAJAH looks up at her and growls.) Except you, Rajah. (Satisfied, he goes back to sleep.) I’ve never even been outside the palace walls.
SULTAN: But Jasmine, you’re a princess.
JASMINE: Then maybe I don’t want to be a princess anymore. (She <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">splashes the water.)</span>
SULTAN: Oooohhh! Allah forbid you should have any <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">daughters!</span>
(RAJAH looks up and thinks for a second. JASMINE goes to the dove <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">cage and yanks open the door. The birds fly off into freedom. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">She watches them go. Cut to int. of SULTAN’s chambers.)</span>
SULTAN: I don’t know where she gets it from. Her mother wasn’t nearly so picky. (A shadow falls over him. He looks up startled and sees JAFAR.) Ooh, oh. Ah, Jafar--my most trusted advisor. I am in desperate need of your wisdom.
JAFAR: My life is but to serve you, my lord. (He bows.)
SULTAN: It’s this suitor business. Jasmine refuses to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">choose a husband. I’m at my wit’s-end.</span>
IAGO: (In the parrot voice) Awk! Wit’s-end.
SULTAN: Oh, ha ha. Have a cracker, pretty Polly! (He pulls a cracker out from his pocket. IAGO looks terrified. Then the SULTAN stuffs it in Iago's mouth. IAGO grimaces as he tries to eat it. JAFAR and the SULTAN both laugh.)
JAFAR: Your majesty certainly has a way with dumb animals. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">(IAGO glares at him.) Now then, perhaps I can </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">divine a solution to this thorny problem.</span>
SULTAN: If anyone can help, it’s you.
JAFAR: Ah, but it would require the use of the mystic blue <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">diamond.</span>
SULTAN: Uh, my ring? But it’s been in the family for <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">years.</span>
JAFAR: It is necessary to find the princess a suitor. (JAFAR says the word ‘princess’ with the accent on the second syllable, "cess." He turns his staff with a cobra head towards the SULTAN. The eyes of the staff begin to glow. The room darkens, JAFAR’s voice slows down and deepens. The SULTAN’s eyes get a hypnotized look.) Don’t worry. Everything will be fine.
SULTAN: Everything…will be…fine.
JAFAR: The diamond.
SULTAN: Here, Jafar. Whatever you need will be fine.
(The SULTAN removes his ring and hands it to JAFAR. The room returns <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to normal as JAFAR pulls back the staff.)</span>
JAFAR: You are most gracious, my liege. Now run along and <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">play with your little toys.</span>
SULTAN: (Still hypnotized) Yes…that’ll be…pretty good.
(JAFAR and IAGO exit. We follow them. When they’re out of the room, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the parrot spits out the cracker.)</span>
IAGO: I can’t take it anymore! If I gotta choke down on <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">one more of those moldy, disgusting crackers…bam! </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Whack!</span>
(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.)
JAFAR: Calm yourself, Iago.
IAGO: Then I’d grab him around the head. Whack! Whack!
JAFAR: (Speaking over IAGO.) Soon, I will be sultan, not <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">that addlepated twit.</span>
IAGO: And then I stuff the crackers down his throat! Ha <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ha!</span>
(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut. Diss. to ext. gardens<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> at night. A shadowy figure walks through. We see it is JASMINE</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> in disguise.

JASMINE: Oh, I’m sorry, Rajah. But I can’t stay here and<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> have my life lived for me. I’ll miss you.

ALADDIN: Okay, Abu. Go!
(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.)
PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd) Try this, your taste buds <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">will dance and sing.

ABU: Blah blah blah!
PROPRIETOR: Why, you. Get away from here, you filthy ape.
(He grabs the melon away from ABU. But in the foreground, ALADDIN <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.)</span>
ABU: Bye bye.
(He zings back up. The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">where he places it on top of a stack. He looks confused, like </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">he has just done this.)</span>
ALADDIN: Nice goin’ Abu. Breakfast is served.
(ALADDIN and ABU on the roof break open the melon and eat. We see J<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ASMINE walking through the street.)</span>
SHOPKEEPER 1: Pretty lady, buy a pot. No finer pot in brass <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">or silver.</span>
SHOPKEEPER 2: Sugar dates, sugar dates and figs! Sugar <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">dates and pistachios!</span>
SHOPKEEPER 3: Would the lady like a necklace. A pretty <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">necklace for a pretty lady.</span>
(She is charmed by the action, but is startled by a fish thrust <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">into her face.)</span>
SHOPKEEPER 4: Fresh fish! We catch ‘em, you buy ‘em!
JASMINE: I don’t think so. (She backs away, but bumps into <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">a fire eater, who is startled into swallowing his </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">fire.) Oh, excuse me. (He gulps, then belches </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">fire from his mouth. JASMINE is disgusted. He is </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">pleased and taps his stomach. ALADDIN sees her, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and a strange look comes over his face.) I’m </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">really very sorry.</span>
ALADDIN: (He’s obviously deeply in love with her.) Wow.
(She pulls the hood of her cloak over her head. ABU sees him and <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">jumps up on his shoulder, waving his hand in front of ALADDIN’s </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">face.)</span>
ABU: Uh oh. Hello? Hello?
(JASMINE stops at the fruit stand and sees a young homeless child <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">reaching for a piece of fruit. She picks one up and gives it to </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">him.)</span>
JASMINE: Oh, you must be hungry. Here you go. (The <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">boy runs off.)</span>
PROPRIETOR: You’d better be able to pay for that.
JASMINE: (Mystified) Pay?
PROPRIETOR: No one steals from my cart.
JASMINE: Oh, I’m sorry sir. I don’t have any money.
PROPRIETOR: Thief.
JASMINE: Please, if you let me go to the palace, I can <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">get some from the Sultan.</span>
PROPRIETOR: Do you know what the penalty is for stealing?
(He takes her hand and pins it down on the table, intending to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">chop it off.)</span>
JASMINE: No, no please.
(The sword drops, but his hand is stopped by ALADDIN’s.)
ALADDIN: Thank you kind sir. I’m so glad you’ve found <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">her. I’ve been looking all over for you.</span>
JASMINE: (whispering) What are you doing?
ALADDIN: (whispering back) Just play along.
PROPRIETOR: You know this girl?
ALADDIN: Sadly, yes. She is my sister. She’s a little <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">crazy. (He circles his finger around his ear. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">She is shocked. The PROPRIETOR grabs him by </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the vest.)</span>
PROPRIETOR: She said she knows the Sultan.
ALADDIN: She thinks the monkey is the Sultan.
(ABU is picking a pocket. He hears this, then straightens up. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">JASMINE, playing along, kneels and bows to ABU.)</span>
JASMINE: Oh, wise Sultan. How may I serve you?
ABU: Well, blah blah blah blah.
ALADDIN: Tragic, isn’t it? (He leans forward, picking<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> up another apple from the cart with his</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> foot.) But, no harm done. (Walks over to</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Jasmine.) Now come along sis. Time to see the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> doctor.</span>
JASMINE: (To a camel standing nearby) Oh, hello doctor. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">How are you?</span>
ALADDIN: No, no, no. Not that one. (To ABU, whose <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">pockets are bulging.) Come on, Sultan.</span>
(ABU bows to the crowd and everything he’s stolen from the cart falls <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">out.)</span>
PROPRIETOR: Huh? What is it? (ABU picks up what he can <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">carry, and the trio run off.) Come back here, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">you little thieves!</span>
(Cut to int. of JAFAR’s lab. IAGO is running on a gear in a bizarre <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">contraption. At the top of the contraption is a storm brewing.)</span>
[explosion]
IAGO: (huffing and puffing) With all due respect, Your <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Rottenness, couldn’t we just wait for a real storm?</span>
JAFAR: Save your breath, Iago. Faster. (He places the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">SULTAN’s ring in the contraption.)</span>
IAGO: Yes, O mighty Evil One. [panting]
(IAGO runs faster. A lightning bolt streaks through the ring, passing into an hourglass below. The sands begin to swirl.)
JAFAR: Part, sands of time. Reveal to me the one who can <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">enter the cave. (The sand in top forms the Cave of </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Wonders. It falls through into a storm, but it </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">shows ALADDIN climbing up a ladder, followed by </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">JASMINE who is covered in her cloak.) Yes... Yes! </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">There he is. My diamond in the rough.</span>
IAGO: That’s him? That’s the clown we’ve been <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">waitin’ for? (IAGO loses his footing and is sucked </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">into the gears.)</span>
JAFAR: Let’s have the guards extend him an invitation to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the palace, shall we?</span>
(IAGO goes flying past and slams into the wall upside down.)
IAGO: Swell. [coughs]
(JAFAR laughs hideously, and the camera zooms in on the sandstorm with <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN in it. Finally, we dissolve into the real ALADDIN climbing </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to the top of the ladder, followed by JASMINE.)</span>
[sinister laughter]
ALADDIN: Almost there.
(JASMINE climbs over the top, but trips and falls into ALADDIN’s arms. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">She stands up.)</span>
JASMINE: I want to thank you for stopping that man.
ALADDIN: Uh, forget it. (He grabs a pole.) So, uh, this is <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">your first time in the marketplace, huh?</span>
(ALADDIN pole vaults to the next building, leaving JASMINE behind.)
JASMINE: Is it that obvious?
ALADDIN: Well, you do kinda stand out. (He stares at her, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">still in love. She returns the look. But he </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">realizes what he is doing, and returns to normal.) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">I mean, uh, you don’t seem to know how dangerous </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Agrabah can be. (He lays a plank between the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">buildings for her to walk over, but as he is leaned </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">down, she vaults over his head. He looks back in </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">surprise. She tosses the pole to him. Both </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN’s and ABU’s eyes bulge.)</span>
JASMINE: I’m a fast learner.
ALADDIN: Right. C’mon, this way. (They go inside the roof <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">of a building, dodging planks and beams as they </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">go.) Whoa. Watch your head there. Be careful.</span>
JASMINE: Is this where you live?
ALADDIN: Yep. Just me and Abu. Come and go as we please.
JASMINE: Fabulous.
ALADDIN: Well, it’s not much, (he pulls back the curtain and <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">exposes the palace) but it’s got a great view. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Palace looks pretty amazing, huh?</span>
JASMINE: Oh, it’s wonderful.
ALADDIN: I wonder what it would be like to live there, to have servants and valets…
JASMINE: Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.
ALADDIN: It’s better than here. Always scraping for food and ducking the guards.
JASMINE: You’re not free to make your own choices.
ALADDIN: Sometimes you feel so--
JASMINE: You’re just--
BOTH: (in unison) --trapped.
(They look at each other, realizing that they’re perfect for one <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">another. But ALADDIN then realizes where he is, and breaks the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">look. He takes the apple out of ABU’s hand and rolls it down his </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">arm into the hand of JASMINE.)</span>
ALADDIN: So, uh, where’re you from?
JASMINE: What does it matter? I ran away, and I am not going back.
ALADDIN: Really? How come? (He takes a bite from the apple in his <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">hand, then hands it to ABU, who has a disgusted </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">look on his face.)</span>
ABU: Why you...!
(ALADDIN walks over and sits next to JASMINE.)
JASMINE: My father’s forcing me to get married.
ALADDIN: That’s--that’s awful. (ABU appears from behind the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">princess and tries to steal the apple.) Abu!</span>
(ABU races up to a higher point, chattering and cursing as he goes.)
JASMINE: What?
ALADDIN: Abu says that--uh--that’s not fair.
ABU: What?
JASMINE: Oh did he?
ALADDIN: Yeah, of course.
JASMINE: And does Abu have anything else to say?
ALADDIN: Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to help.</span>
ABU: Oh, boy!
JASMINE: Hmm... tell him that’s very... sweet.
(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN leans in to kiss her. He is interrupted, however, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">by the GUARDS, who have found them.)</span>
GUARD: Here you are!
ALADDIN and JASMINE: They’re after me! (To each other) They’re <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">after you?</span>
JASMINE: My father must have sent them--
ALADDIN: Do you trust me?
JASMINE: What?
ALADDIN: Do you trust me? (He extends his hand)
JASMINE: Yes. (She takes it.)
ALADDIN: Then jump!
(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt. They <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.)</span>
GUARD: We just keep running into each other, don’t we, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">street rat?</span>
(Again, the Guard’s turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">here and block the exit. The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">throws him in a vase. Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.)</span>
GUARD: It’s the dungeon for you, boy.
ALADDIN: Hey, get off of me!
JASMINE: Let go of him.
GUARD: (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">have here, men--a street mouse. (He throws her </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">down.)</span>
JASMINE: (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Unhand him, by order of the princess!</span>
(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.)
GUARD: Princess Jasmine.
ALADDIN: The princess?
ABU: (peeking out from the vase) The princess?
GUARD: What are you doing outside the palace? And with <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">this street rat?</span>
JASMINE: That’s not your concern. Do as I command. Release <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">him!</span>
GUARD: Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Jafar. You’ll have to take it up with him.</span>
(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.)
JASMINE: (getting a very fed-up look) Believe me, I will.
(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers. He <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">in before he is finished. He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the door frame.)</span>
JASMINE: Jafar?
JAFAR: Oh, uh, princess.
IAGO: Awk! Jafar, I’m stuck!
JAFAR: How may I be of service to you? (He spreads out his cape, hiding the door.)
JASMINE: The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.
JAFAR: Your father’s charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.
JASMINE: What was the crime?
IAGO: I can’t breathe, Jafar.
JAFAR: Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.
IAGO: If you could just--(JAFAR kicks him back inside the door and it slams shut)--wow, that hurt!
JASMINE: He didn’t kidnap me! I ran away!
JAFAR: (Walking away as if shocked) Oh, dear! Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known.
JASMINE: What do you mean?
JAFAR: Sadly, the boy’s sentence has already been carried out.
JASMINE: What sentence?
JAFAR: (with a sinister tone) Death. (JASMINE gasps.) By beheading.
JASMINE: No! (She collapses to the floor.)
JAFAR: I am exceedingly sorry, princess.
JASMINE: How could you? (She runs from the room crying.)
(IAGO finally makes it out through the door. He flies up and lands on JAFAR’s shoulder, coughing.)
IAGO: So, how did it go?
JAFAR: I think she took it... rather well. (They both get a sinister smile on their faces.)
(Diss. to JASMINE at night, crying at the edge of the fountain. RAJAH comes over to comfort her. She pets him.)
JASMINE: It’s all my fault, Rajah. I didn’t even know his name.
(Cut to int. of dungeon. Rats scurry by, and we descend until we see ALADDIN chained to the wall.)
ALADDIN: (to himself) She was the princess. I can’t believe it. I must have sounded so stupid to her!
ABU: (from a distance) Yoo-hoo! Aladdin? Hello!
(ABU appears at the window at the top of the dungeon.)
ALADDIN: Abu! Down here! Hey, c’mon--help me outta these.
(ABU stops, then begins chattering wildly, dropping to the ground. He <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wraps a cloth around his head and makes his eyes big in an </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">imitation of the princess.)</span>
ALADDIN: Hey, she was in trouble. Ah, she was worth it.
(ABU jumps up on ALADDIN’s shoulders and pulls a small set of tools <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">out of his pocket, then frees ALADDIN.)</span>
ABU: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
ALADDIN: Don’t worry, Abu. I’ll never see her again. I’m a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">street rat, remember, and there’s a law. She’s </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">gotta marry a prince. She deserves a prince.</span>
(ABU finally frees ALADDIN’s hands.)
ABU: Ta-da!
ALADDIN: (Rubbing his wrists) I’m a… I’m a fool.
OLD MAN: You’re only a fool if you give up, boy.
(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">have seen before.)</span>
ALADDIN: Who are you?
OLD MAN: A lowly prisoner like yourself. But together, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">perhaps we can be more.</span>
ALADDIN: I’m listening.
OLD MAN: There is a cave, boy... a Cave of Wonders, filled <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I’d </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wager.</span>
(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">’princess’ as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">of "PRIN-cess." The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">his head out of JAFAR’s "old man" disguise.)</span>
IAGO: Jafar, can ya hurry up? I’m dyin’ in here. [squawking]
ALADDIN: But the law says that only a prince can…
OLD MAN: You’ve heard of the golden rule, haven’t you?<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Whoever has the gold makes the rules. (He grins, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">showing a hideously bad mouth.) [wheezing laugh]</span>
ALADDIN: So why would you share all this wonderful <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">treasure with me?</span>
OLD MAN: I need a young pair of legs and a strong <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">back to go in after it.</span>
ALADDIN: Uh, one problem. It’s out there. We’re in here.
(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.)
OLD MAN: Mm-mm-mm. Things aren’t always what they <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">seem. So… do we have a deal?</span>
(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.)
ABU: Oh, I don’t know.
(Cut to desert scene. We see ALADDIN leading a horse with the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">OLD MAN and ABU on it. Diss. to Cave of Wonders.)</span>
[thunder crashing]
CAVE: Who disturbs my slumber?
ALADDIN: Uh, it is I, Aladdin.
CAVE: Proceed. Touch nothing but the lamp.
(The cave opens up with a roar, and a staircase appears in front of <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN. )</span>
OLD MAN: Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp, and then <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">you shall have your reward.</span>
ALADDIN: Come on, Abu. (to ABU hiding under the shoulder of <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">his vest.)</span>
[squeaking]
(ALADDIN begins to descend the staircase. He reaches the bottom <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and enters a golden chamber filled with treasure.)</span>
ALADDIN: Would you look at that?
ABU: [whimpering] Uh oh.
ALADDIN: Just a handful of this stuff would make me richer <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">than the Sultan.</span>
(ABU peeks out, sees the treasure, then bolts for it.)
ALADDIN: Abu.
[whines]
(ABU stops in mid run, hovering over a rug on the floor.)
ALADDIN: Don’t… touch… anything. We gotta find that lamp.
(They begin to make their way through the room when the CARPET rises <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">off the floor and begins following them. ABU gets the feeling </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">they’re being followed.)</span>
ABU: Huh?
(He turns, and the CARPET lies flat on the floor. He continues, and <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the CARPET begins to follow again. Again, ABU turns back, but the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">CARPET is rolled up and leaning against a pile of treasure. ABU </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">runs to ALADDIN and tugs his pant leg.)</span>
ABU: Aladdin, Aladdin.
ALADDIN: Abu, will you knock it off?
(Again the CARPET follows, but this time, when ABU turns, the carpet <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">jumps to the other side. It reaches down with a tassel and pulls </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ABU’s tail. When ABU jumps around, CARPET again goes to the other </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">side. This time, ABU lands in a karate stance. CARPET reaches </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">down and plucks ABU’s hat off, then puts it on himself. ABU sits </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">thinking for a second, until CARPET waves a tassel in front of his </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">face. ABU and CARPET both jump scared, and run away. ABU tackles </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN and turns his head to look at the CARPET.)</span>
[screeches]
ALADDIN: Abu, what are you, crazy?
(The CARPET peeks out from behind a pile of treasure.)
ALADDIN: A magic carpet. Come on. Come on out. I'm not gonna <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">hurt you.</span>
(The CARPET slowly comes out, shyly, then picks up ABU’s hat and dusts <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">it off. It flies over to ALADDIN and hands the hat to ABU next to </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">him. ABU screeches, and jumps onto ALADDIN’s shoulder.)</span>
[screeches]
ALADDIN: Hey, take it easy, Abu. He’s not gonna bite. Thanks.
(The CARPET again picks up ABU’s hat and hands it to him. ABU shakes <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">his fist and screeches at it. CARPET begins to walk away, "sadly.")</span>
[squeaking]
ALADDIN: Hey. Wait a minute. Don’t go. Maybe you can help <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">us. (CARPET looks back, excited. It then flies </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">over and wraps around the pair.) Hey, whoa. You </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">see, we’re trying to find this lamp. (CARPET </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">motions for them to follow it.) I think he knows </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">where it is.</span>
ABU: [squeaks excitedly] [echoes]
(They pass through a long cave, until they emerge in a giant <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">underground cavern. In the center of the room is a tall pillar, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">with a staircase going up to it. It is surrounded by water </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">with unevenly placed stones forming a bridge. At the top of </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the pillar is a beam of light. ALADDIN begins to cross the bridge.)</span>
ALADDIN: [whispers] Wait here.
ABU: [moaning] Oh. Huh? Oh!
(ABU sees a shrine with a golden monkey. The outstretched paws hold a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">giant ruby. ABU is hypnotically drawn to it. ALADDIN climbs the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">stairs quickly. CARPET sees ABU and grabs his tail trying in vain </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to hold him back. ALADDIN finally reaches the MAGIC LAMP.)</span>
ALADDIN: This is it? This is what we came all the way down <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">here to… (He looks down and sees ABU break free </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">of CARPET’s hold and lunge toward the jewel.) Abu! No</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">w</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">!</span>
(ABU grabs the jewel. There is a rumbling and the room begins to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">shake.)</span>
CAVE VOICE: Infidels!
ABU: Uh oh.
CAVE VOICE: You have touched the forbidden treasure! (ABU <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">places the jewel back into the paw, but the jewel </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and the shrine melt into lava.) Now you </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">will never again see the light of day!</span>
ALADDIN: Whoa!
(ALADDIN races down the steps, but they flatten into a ramp, and he <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">skies down until he flies into the air. The water has turned into </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">lava. He is falling toward it, when all of a sudden CARPET appears </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and catches him. ABU is standing on one of the rocks of the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">bridge. He looks left and right and sees rocks exploding into lava. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Then CARPET races over and ALADDIN grabs him, just as the last rock </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">is exploding.)</span>
ABU: Help, help, help!
ALADDIN: Gotcha! Whoa, Carpet, let’s move!
(Together, they race back through the caves dodging walls and falling <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">debris. ABU grabs ALADDIN’s head and covers his eyes.)</span>
ALADDIN: Abu! Abu, this is no time to panic! (He pulls ABU off <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">his head and sees they are flying into a wall.) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Start panicking!</span>
[Abu panting] [thunder cracks] [roaring]
(CARPET goes into a dive, then through another cave. Finally, they <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">emerge through the internal entrance. Outside, the cave begins to </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">growl and close. CARPET and company are almost to the top when a </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">boulder drops on carpet, with a clip of THX Optimizer, sending it to the floor. ALADDIN grabs </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">onto the rock wall and holds on. He sees the OLD MAN at the top, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">within reach.)</span>
ALADDIN: Help me out!
OLD MAN: Throw me the lamp!
ALADDIN: I can’t hold on. Give me your hand!
OLD MAN: First give me the lamp!
(ALADDIN reaches in and pulls out the MAGIC LAMP. He hands it up, a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">nd the OLD MAN raises it above his head.)</span>
OLD MAN: [laughing] Yes! At last! [puts the lamp in]
[Aladdin struggles]
(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU. But the OLD <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN’s wrist.)</span>
ALADDIN: What are you doing?
OLD MAN: Giving you your reward! (JAFAR returns to his<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> normal voice.) Your eternal reward. [screaming]</span>
(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ABU bites him on the wrist. He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">who falls into the cave. OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> well. The clip ends from THX Optimizer, falling down. CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> boulder. It struggles to break free, then does. It races</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> times, and is unconscious. On the surface, the cave roars one</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> final time, then sinks back into the sand. JAFAR pulls off</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> his disguise.) [yelling]</span>
[roaring]
JAFAR: It’s mine! It’s all mine! I-- (He can’t <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">find it in his pocket) Where is it? No! No...!</span>
(Kiss fade to JASMINE’s bedroom. She is sitting on her bed, next <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.)</span>
SULTAN: Jasmine? Oh, dearest. What’s wrong?
JASMINE: Jafar…has…done something… terrible. (She <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">looks as if she’s been crying.) </span>
SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we’ll set it right. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Now, tell me everything.</span>
(Cut to int. of cave. ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ABU tries to wake him.)</span>
ABU: Oh, oh. Aladdin? Wake up. Aladdin.
(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up. He awakes slowly.)
ALADDIN: Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">We’re trapped. (Angry, shaking his fists at the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal! (Calmer) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Whoever he was, he’s long gone with that lamp.</span>
ABU: Aha!
(ABU pulls out the MAGIC LAMP.)
ALADDIN: Heh! Why, you hairy little thief! Looks like such a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">beat-up, worthless piece of junk. Hey, I think </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">there’s something written here, but it’s hard to </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">make out.</span>
(He rubs the LAMP. Suddenly smoke comes out of the hole, the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">LAMP begins to shake and glow, but ALADDIN holds onto the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">LAMP, and our wonderful friend, the GENIE comes out.)</span>
GENIE: Aaaaahhhhh! OY! Ten-thousand years will give ya <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">such a crick in the neck! (He hangs ALADDIN on a </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">nearby rock. Then he pulls his head off and spins </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">it around, yelling as he does so. CARPET pulls a </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN down.) Whoa! Does it feel good to be </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">outta there! (GENIE uses the lamp end of himself as</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> a microphone.) Nice to be back, ladies and </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">gentlemen. Hi, where ya from? (Sticks the mic in </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN’s face.) What’s your name?</span>
ALADDIN: Uh, Al--uh--Aladdin.
GENIE: (Says his name as if he’s discovered something <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">major) Aladdin! (A neon sign lights up with </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">ALADDIN’s name on it, circled by chase lights. The </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">sign changes to reflect the GENIE’s upcoming line.) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Hello, Aladdin. Nice to have you on the show. Can </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">we call you ‘Al?’ Or maybe just ‘Din?’ Or how </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">bout ‘Laddi?’ (GENIE disappears, then a dog </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wrapped in plaid jumps in.) Sounds like ‘Here, boy! </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">C’mon, Laddi!’</span>
ALADDIN: (Shaking his head) I must have hit my head harder <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">than I thought.</span>
GENIE: (Still a dog) Do you smoke? Mind if I do? (Dog <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">poofs into smoke, then back to the GENIE. ABU </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">screeches wildly.) Oh, sorry Cheetah--hope I </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">didn’t singe the fur! Yo, Rugman! Haven’t seen</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> you in a few millennia! Slap me some tassel! Yo! </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Yeah! (CARPET flies over and high fives the GENIE. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">GENIE looks at ALADDIN.) Say, you’re a lot smaller </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">than my last master. (Lifts his beer-gut.) Either </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">that or I’m gettin’ bigger. Look at me from the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">side--do I look different to you?</span>
ALADDIN: Wait a minute! I’m--your master?
GENIE: (Slaps a diploma in ALADDIN’s hand and a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">mortarboard on his head.) That’s right! He can </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">be taught!! What would you wish of me, (as <a href="/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger">Arnold</a> </span><a href="/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger" title="Arnold Schwarzenegger"><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Schwarzenegger</span></a><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">) the ever impressive, (inside a </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">cube) the long contained, (as a ventriloquist with </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">a dummy) often imitated, (tosses the dummy aside) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">but never duplicated-- </span>(He multiplies into multiple GENIES who surround him.) DUP.
GENIES: Duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">duplicated, duplicated, duplicated, </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">duplicated, duplicated, duplicated</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">.</span>
GENIE: (Says it like a ring announcer at a boxing match.) <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Genie Of The Lamp! (Goes into Ed </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Sullivan) Right here direct from the lamp, right </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">here for your enjoyment wish fulfillment. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Thank you! </span>
ALADDIN: Whoa! Wish fulfillment?
GENIE: Three wishes to be exact. And ix-nay on the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wishing for more wishes. (Turns into a slot </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">machine, arm pulls down and three G</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">enie</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">s appear in</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the windows.) That’s it--three. (Three GENIE</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> caballeros come out of the slot.) Uno, dos, tres.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (Changes into b/w Groucho Marx.) No</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> substitutions, exchanges or refunds. (The duck</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> drops with the secret word "Refunds.’</span>
ALADDIN: (To ABU) Now I know I’m dreaming.
<i>(GENIE produces 40 thieves who surround ALADDIN with swords. GENIE appears in his vest, then sticks his arms out and boxes the thieves into submission.)</i>
<i>(Boxing ring appears, ALADDIN in the corner, being massaged by GENIE. Then GENIE turns into a pile of fireworks and explodes and fire at one of our heroes. Then GENIE appears inside lamp and grabs ALADDIN’s hand and rubs lamp with it.)</i>
<i>(GENIE produces a table and chairs, then writes down things on a note pad, like a waiter. )</i>
<i>(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN. Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.)</i>
<i>(The Genies give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?) surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women. The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.)</i>
<i>(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top. He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE. He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase. A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out. The mini GENIE does a little dance with the Genie's two giant hands. At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.)</i>
<i>(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball. He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base. He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit. The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN. Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.)</i>
<i>(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN. GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN’s ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.)</i>
<i>(The dancing HAREM GIRLS reappear, and ALADDIN leans in to kiss one. She turns into the GENIE, who zaps four dancing elephants into existence. To the other direction, he zaps in four dancing camels, and a grand finale dancing number ensues, as well our Heroes dancing along as well. ABU grabs as much gold as he can, but the GENIE wraps everything up in a cyclone and zaps it away until they’re all back in the cave. GENIE has a neon "APPLAUSE" sign on his back. ABU turns his hat over and sees that is is empty.)</i>
GENIE: So what’ll it be, master?
ALADDIN: You’re gonna grant me any three wishes I want?
GENIE: (As William F. Buckley) Ah, almost. There are a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">few provisos, a couple of quid pro quos</span>
ALADDIN: Like?
GENIE: Ah, rule number one: I can’t kill anybody. (He slices his head off with his finger.) So don’t ask. Rule two: I can’t make anyone fall in love with anyone else. (Head turns into a big pair of lips which kiss ALADDIN.) You little punim, there. (Lies flat, then gets up and transforms into a zombie.) Rule three: I can’t bring people back from the dead. It’s not a pretty picture, (He grabs ALADDIN and shakes him) I don’t like doing it! (He poofs back to normal.) Other than that, you got it!
ALADDIN: (Looks at ABU as if plotting) Ah, provisos? You mean limitations? On wishes? (To ABU) Some all powerful genie--can’t even bring people back from the dead. I don’t know, Abu--he probably can’t even get us out of this cave. Looks like we’re gonna have to find a way out of here--
(They start to leave, but a big blue foot stomps down in front of <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">them.)</span>
GENIE: Excuse me? Are you lookin’ at me? Did you rub my lamp? Did you wake me up, did you bring me here? And all of a sudden, you’re walkin’ out on me? (Gets madder and madder) I don’t think so, not right now. You’re getting your wishes, so sit down! (They all get on CARPET. GENIE takes the form of a stewardess, with lots of arms pointing out the exits.) In case of emergency, the exits are here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, anywhere! Keep your hands and arms inside the carpet. Weeee’rrrrrreee…outta here..
(The CARPET and passengers fly out of the sand in the desert and off<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> into the distance. Cut to int. of Sultan's chamber. JAFAR is </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">there with IAGO, JASMINE and the SULTAN.)</span>
SULTAN: Jafar, this is an outrage. If it weren’t for all<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> your years of loyal service… From now on,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> you are to discuss sentencing of prisoners with me,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> before they are beheaded.</span>
JAFAR: I assure you, your highness, it won’t happen again.
SULTAN: Jasmine, Jafar, now let’s put this whole messy business behind us. Please?
JAFAR: My most abject and humblest apologies to you as <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">well, princess. (He takes her hand to kiss it, but </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">she yanks it away.)</span>
JASMINE: At least some good will come of my being forced to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">marry. When I am queen, I will have the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">power to get rid of you.</span>
SULTAN: That’s nice. All settled, then. Now, Jasmine,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> getting back to this suitor business, (he </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">looks and sees Jasmine walking out) Jasmine?</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Jasmine! (He runs after her.)</span>
JAFAR: If only I had gotten that lamp!
IAGO: (As JASMINE) I will have the power to get rid of<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> you! D’oh! To think--we gotta keep kissing </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">up to that chump, and his chump daughter for the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> rest of our lives…</span>
JAFAR: No, Iago. Only until she finds a chump husband. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Then she’ll have us banished--or beheaded!</span>
BOTH: Eeewww!
IAGO: (Has an idea) Oh! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Jafar? What if you were the chump husband?</span>
JAFAR: (He looks at IAGO in insult) What?
IAGO: Okay, you marry the princess, all right? Then, uh, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">you become sultan!</span>
JAFAR: Oh! Marry the shrew? I become sultan. The idea has<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> merit!</span>
IAGO: Yes, merit! Yes! And then we drop papa-in-law and<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the little woman off a cliff! (Dive bombs into the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">floor) Kersplat!</span>
JAFAR: Iago, I love the way your foul little mind works!
(Both laugh as we cut to an oasis in the desert, where CARPET is <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">coming in for a landing.)</span>
GENIE: (Still as stewardess) Thank you for choosing Magic<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Carpet for all your travel needs. Don’t stand </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">until the rug has come to a complete stop. (As</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ALADDIN and ABU get off down the stairway formed by</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> CARPET) Thank you. Good bye, good bye! Thank you!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Good bye! (Back to normal) Well, now. How about </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">that, Mr. doubting mustafa?</span>
ALADDIN: Oh, you sure showed me. Now about my three wishes-
GENIE: Dost mine ears deceive me? Three? You are down by<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ONE, boy!</span>
ALADDIN: Ah, no--I never actually wished to get out of the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> cave. You did that on your own.</span>
(GENIE thinks for a second, then his jaw drops. He turns into a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">sheep.)</span>
GENIE: Well, don’t I feel just sheepish? All right, you <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">baaaaad boy, but no more freebies.</span>
ALADDIN: Fair deal. So, three wishes. I want them to be<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> good. (To GENIE) What would you wish for?</span>
(GENIE is hanging like a hammock between two trees.)
GENIE: Me? No one’s ever asked me that before. Well, in<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> my case, ah, forget it.</span>
ALADDIN: What? No, tell me.
GENIE: Freedom.
ALADDIN: You’re a prisoner?
GENIE: It’s all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">(Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> powers! (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Itty bitty living space</span>
ALADDIN: Genie, that’s terrible.
GENIE: (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free. Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?" To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all the world! But what am I talking about, here? Let’s get real here. It’s not gonna happen. Genie, wake up and  smell the hummus.
ALADDIN: Why not?
GENIE: The only way I get outta this is if my master <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wishes me out. So you can guess how often that’s </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">happened.</span>
ALADDIN: I’ll do it. I’ll set you free.
GENIE: (Head turns into Pinocchio’s with a long nose) Uh <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">huh, right. Whoop!</span>
ALADDIN: No, really, I promise. (He pushes the nose back in <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and Genie’s head returns to normal.) After make my</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> first two wishes, I’ll use my third wish to set you</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> free. (He holds out his hand)</span>
GENIE: Well, here’s hopin’. (Shakes ALADDIN’s hand.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> All right. Let’s make some magic. (Turns into a</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> magician.) So how ‘bout it. What is it you want </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">most?</span>
ALADDIN: Well, there’s this girl.
GENIE: Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and Genie's chest shows a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> heart with a cross through it.) Wrong. I can’t</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> make anybody fall in love, remember?</span>
ALADDIN: Oh, but, Genie, she’s smart and fun and…
GENIE: Pretty?
ALADDIN: Beautiful. She’s got these eyes that just… and<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> this hair. Wow. And her smile… [sighs]</span>
GENIE: (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> </span><i>Ami.</i><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> </span><i>C’est l’amour.</i>
ALADDIN: But she’s the princess. To even have a chance, I’d<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> have to be… Hey, can you make me a prince?</span>
GENIE: Let’s see here. (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Chicken à la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head) Nope. Alaskan king crab. (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "<a href="/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid" title="The Little Mermaid">The Little Mermaid</a>" clamped on.) Ow. I hate it when they do that. Caesar’s salad? Ah! (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) <i>Et Tu,</i> Brute? No. Aha. "To make a prince." (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.) Is that an official wish? Say the words.
ALADDIN: Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince!
GENIE: All right! Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.) First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar? No! Let’s work with me here. (He takes Aladdin's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.) I like it, muy macho! Now, still needs something. What does it say to me? It says mode of transportation. Excuse me, monkey boy! Aqui, over here!
(ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.)
ABU: Uh oh!
GENIE: Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.) And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel! Watch out, it spits! (A door bearing the Genie's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel. He spits out the side of his mouth on cue. But the Genie’s not sure.) Mmm, not enough. (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough. Let’s see. What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into: a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a ‘57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1." (That one’s a guess, I don’t know cars, but judging by the tail fins, ‘nuff said.) Finally, he’s returned to normal.) Yes!! Esalalumbo, shimin <a href="/wiki/Dumbo" title="Dumbo">dumbo</a>! Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, <a href="/wiki/Dumbo" title="Dumbo">Dumbo</a>, ABU turns into an elephant. CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU’s size 46 feet.) Talk about your trunk space, check this action out!
(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree.<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.)</span>
ALADDIN: Abu, you look good.
GENIE: He’s got the outfit, he’s got the elephant, but<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> we’re not through yet. Hang on to your turban,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> kid, cause we’re gonna make you a star!</span>
(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">begin to explode outward. Cut to a stack of a pile of toys. </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">(Look for the BEAST here.) We tilt up and see the SULTAN</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> balancing them. He carefully balances the last piece on top,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> then sits back and sighs. JAFAR storms in, though, and the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> pile collapses.)</span>
JAFAR: Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">your daughter.</span>
IAGO: Awk! The problem with your daughter!
SULTAN: Oh, really?
JAFAR: (Unrolling a scroll) Right here. "If the princess<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> has not chosen a husband by the appointed time,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> then the sultan shall choose for her."</span>
SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors! (He tries to<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> stuff a cracker into Iago's mouth. IAGO backs</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> away. The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> back.) How could I choose someone she hates?</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> cracker in his mouth.)</span>
JAFAR: Not to worry, my liege. There is more. If, in the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> must then be wed to…hmm…interesting.</span>
SULTAN: What? Who?
JAFAR: The royal vizier! Why, that would be…me!
SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> marry a princess, I’m quite sure.</span>
JAFAR: Desperate times call for desperate measures, my<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> lord. (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> SULTAN with it.)</span>
SULTAN: Yes…desperate measures…
JAFAR: You will order the princess to marry me.
SULTAN: I…will order…the princess…to…(the spell<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> breaks momentarily)…but you’re so old!</span>
JAFAR: (Holds the staff closer) The princess <i>will</i> marry <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">me!</span>
SULTAN: The princess will marry…(the spell is again<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Ali".) What? What is that? That music! Ha ha ha.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Jafar, you must come and see this!</span>
(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">human form as a MAJOR.)</span>
MARCHERS: Make way for Prince Ali!
SWORDSMEN: Say hey! It’s Prince Ali!
MAJOR: Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Hey you, let us through, it’s a bright new star,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Oh, come, be the first on your block to meet his eye!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Make way, here he comes,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Ring bells, bang the drums.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> You’re gonna love this guy</span>
(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Genuflect, show some respect </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Down on one knee</span>
(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Now try your best to stay calm</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Brush up your Sunday Salaam</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> And come and meet his spectacular coterie.</span>
(IAGO is dancing to the music until JAFAR glares at him. The<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> MAJOR "wheelbarrows" six men up onto ABU’s trunk. They stand</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> on each other’s shoulders as ALI shakes hands.)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Prince Ali, mighty is he, Ali Ababwa!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Strong as ten regular men, definitely</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> He faced the galloping hordes</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> A hundred bad guys with swords</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Who sent those goons to their lords, why Prince Ali!</span>
(The pile collapses on ALI, but a GENIE (TM) brand lightning bolt<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> zaps the pile and he ends up holding them all up in an acrobatic</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> wheel formation. The GENIE turns into an old man, then a child </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and speaks the last two lines to the crowd.)</span>
CHORUS OF MEN: (Carrying the camels) He’s got 75 golden camels!
(In pops a typical parade commentator)
HARRY: Don’t they look lovely, June?
CHORUS OF WOMEN: (On a float) Purple peacocks, he’s got 53!
(In comes another commentator.)
JUNE: (Mary Hart’s voice) Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.
GENIE: (GENIE is off screen, a giant balloon ape proceeds down <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">the parade)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> When it comes to exotic-type mammals</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Has he got a zoo I’m telling you</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> It’s a world-class menagerie!</span>
(GENIE pops in as a leopard, then a goat, and speaks the last two<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> lines to the two children from earlier. We cut to a balcony,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> where three HAREM GIRLS are joined by the HAREM GENIE.)</span>
<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">GENIE: (with ETHEL MERMAN’s voice)</span>
<span style="font-weight:400;background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">GIRLS: (in counterpoint, hearts beating)</span>

(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace. She<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> humphs it off.)</span>
CHORUS: He’s got 95 white Persian monkeys!
(He’s got the monkeys, let’s see the monkeys!)
And to view them, he charges no fee!
(He’s generous, so generous)
He’s got slaves, he’s got servants and flunkies!
(Proud to work for him)
They bow to his whim, love serving him
They’re just lousy with loyalty to Ali! Prince Ali!
(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them. ABU, ALADDIN and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside. The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU and ALADDIN leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.)
CHORUS and GENIE: Prince Ali, Amorous he! Ali Ababwa!
GENIE: Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see!
And that, good people, is why
He got dolled up and dropped by
CHORUS: With 60 elephants, llamas galore
With his bears and lions
A brass band and more
With his 40 fakirs, his cooks, his bakers
His birds that warble on key
Make way for Prince Ali!
(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU’s back <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN. JAFAR slams the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">door shut.)</span>
SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous.
ALADDIN: (Takes on a deeper voice.) Ahem. Your majesty, I have <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">journeyed from afar to seek your daughter’s hand.</span>
SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa! Of course. I’m delighted to <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">meet you. (He rushes over and shakes ALI’s hand.) </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">This is my royal vizier, Jafar. He’s delighted </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">too.</span>
JAFAR: (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic. I’m afraid, Prince <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Abooboo--</span>
ALADDIN: --Ababwa!
JAFAR: Whatever. Right. You cannot just parade in here uninvited <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and expect to--</span>
SULTAN: …by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device.<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">mustache.) I don’t suppose I might…</span>
ALADDIN: Why certainly, your majesty. Allow me.
(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down.<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.)</span>
JAFAR: Sire, I must advise against this--
SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar. Learn to have a little fun.
(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away. IAGO, who<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> bopping the staff with his beak as he descends. SULTAN and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> flying under ABU, scaring him. The flight continues in the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> background, while JAFAR and ALI</span> <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">talk in the foreground.)</span>
JAFAR: Just where did you say you were from?
ALADDIN: Oh, much farther than you’ve traveled, I’m sure.<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (He smiles. JAFAR does not.)</span>
JAFAR: Try me. (Iago lands on the staff.)
SULTAN: Look out, Polly!
(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimeters over their<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> heads. CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.)</span>
IAGO: Hey, watch it. Watch it with the dumb rug!
(The CARPET zooms underneath IAGO, who sighs, wipes his brow, and<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> crashes into a pillar. He crashes to the floor, and his head</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> is circled by miniature SULTANS on CARPETS, saying "Have a cracker,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> have a cracker.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">"</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> The real SULTAN begins his final approach.)</span>
SULTAN: Out of the way, I’m coming in to land. Jafar, watch this! (He lands.)
JAFAR: Spectacular, your highness.
SULTAN: Ooh, lovely. Yes, I do seem to have a knack for<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> it. (CARPET walks over to ABU dizzily, then </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">collapses. ABU catches it.) This is a very</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> impressive youth. And a prince as well. (Whispers</span> <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">to JAFAR) If we’re lucky, you won’t have to marry </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Jasmine after all.</span>
JAFAR: I don’t trust him, sire.
SULTAN: Nonsense. One thing I pride myself on Jafar, I’m an excellent judge of character.
IAGO: Oh, excellent judge, yeah, sure…not!!!
(JASMINE walks in quietly.)
SULTAN: Jasmine will like this one!
ALADDIN: And I’m pretty sure I’ll like Princess Jasmine!
JAFAR: Your highness, no. I must intercede on Jasmine’s <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">behalf. (JASMINE hears this and gets mad.) This </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">boy is no different than the others. What makes</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> him think he is worthy of the princess?</span>
ALADDIN: Your majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa! (He pricks<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> JAFAR’s goatee, which springs out in all</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> directions.) Just let her meet me. I will win</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> your daughter!</span>
JASMINE: How dare you! (They all look at her surprised.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> All of you, standing around deciding my future? I</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> am not a prize to be won</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">! (She storms out.)</span>
SULTAN: Oh, dear. Don’t worry, Prince Ali. Just give Jasmine time to cool down. (They exit.)
JAFAR: I think it’s time to say good bye to Prince Abooboo.
(Diss to JASMINE on her balcony at night. We tilt down and find ALADDIN and company in the courtyard.)
ALADDIN: What am I going to do? Jasmine won’t even let me <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">talk to her. I should have known I couldn’t pull</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> off this stupid prince wish. (ABU struggles with</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> his elephant paws to open a banana. He squishes</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> it, and the banana squirts into his eye. He then </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);white-space:pre-wrap;">tosses the banana peel into a heaping pile of the same.)</span>
GENIE: (to carpet, playing chess) So move! (CARPET does, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">knocking a black piece off the board.) Hey.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> That’s a good move. (As <a href="/wiki/Rodney_Dangerfield" title="Rodney Dangerfield">Rodney Dangerfield</a>) I</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> can’t believe it--I’m losing to a rug.</span>
ALADDIN: Genie, I need help.
GENIE: (as <a href="/wiki/Jack_Nicholson" title="Jack Nicholson">Jack Nicholson</a>) All right, sparky, here’s the <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">deal. You wanna court the little lady, you gotta</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> be a straight shooter, do ya follow me?</span>
ALADDIN: What?
GENIE: (Back to normal, wearing a mortarboard. He points<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> out his words on a blackboard) Tell her</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the…TRUTH!!!</span>
ALADDIN: No way! If Jasmine found out I was really some <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">crummy street rat, she’d laugh at me. (He</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> puts on his turban, which lights up as the GENIE.)</span>
GENIE: A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh!<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (ALADDIN pulls the chain turning off the light.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> GENIE comes out holding the real turban.) Al, all</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> joking aside, you really oughta be yourself.</span>
ALADDIN: Hey, that’s the last thing I want to be. Okay,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> I’m gonna go see her. I gotta be smooth, cool,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> confident. How do I look?</span>
GENIE: (Sadly) Like a prince.
(ALADDIN flies up to the balcony on CARPET. Personal Slave Girl JASMINE is on her bed, <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">sighing. RAJAH is by her side.)</span>
ALADDIN: (From a distance) Princess Jasmine?
(RAJAH looks up and growls.)
JASMINE: Who’s there?
ALADDIN: It’s me--Prince Ali. Ahem--(Then he jumps to his<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> deep voice) Prince Ali Ababwa.</span>
JASMINE: I do not want to see you.
ALADDIN: No, no, please princess. Give me a chance.
(RAJAH<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> growls and advances on him.)</span>
JASMINE: Just leave me alone.
ALADDIN: Down kitty!
(Over the edge of the balcony, CARPET is watching with GENIE below.)
GENIE: So how’s our little beau doing?
(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.)
ALADDIN: C'mon, good kitty, take off and go. Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.)
JASMINE: (She looks at him thinking as she has seen him before.) Wait, wait. Do I know you?
ALADDIN: (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no.
JASMINE: You remind me of someone I met in the marketplace.
ALADDIN: The marketplace? (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn’t have been me you met.
JASMINE: (She looks disappointed) No, I guess not.
BEE: (It’s the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her! She’s smart, fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature!
ALADDIN: Um, Princess Jasmine? You’re very…
BEE: Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual!
ALADDIN: Punctual!
JASMINE: Punctual?
BEE: Sorry.
ALADDIN: Beautiful.
BEE: Nice recovery.
JASMINE: Hmm. I’m rich too, you know.
ALADDIN: Yeah!
JASMINE: The daughter of a sultan.
ALADDIN: I know.
JASMINE: A fine prize for any prince to marry.
ALADDIN: Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.
BEE: (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning!
JASMINE: Right, a prince like you. And every other stuffed shirt, swaggering, peacock I’ve met!
BEE: (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday!
JASMINE: Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away)
ALADDIN: What?
BEE: Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her?
ALADDIN: (Swats at bee) Buzz off!
BEE: Okay, fine. But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban)
ALADDIN: Yeah, right!
JASMINE: What!?
ALADDIN: Uh, you’re right. You aren’t just some prize to be won, (He looks disappointed.) You should be free to make your own choice. (Personal Slave Girl JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.) I’ll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.)
JASMINE: No!
ALADDIN: (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What? What?
JASMINE: (Now she’s amazed) How--how are you doing that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.)
ALADDIN: It’s a magic carpet.
JASMINE: It’s lovely. (CARPET takes Jasmine's hand with a tassel.)
ALADDIN: You, uh, you don’t want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world.
JASMINE: Is it safe?
ALADDIN: Sure. Do you trust me?
JASMINE: (She looks at him at the saying of that all-important line) What?
ALADDIN: (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me?
JASMINE: (lets a sly grin on her face) Yes.
(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET. It zooms into the sky,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> knocking them both into sitting positions. The music of "A Whole</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> New World" swells. JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> up at her questioningly. She gasps as they fly over the palace</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> wall and into the sky.)</span>
ALADDIN: I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide?
(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower. It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to Personal Slave Girl JASMINE. She smiles.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> I can open your eyes</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Take you wonder by wonder</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Over, sideways, and under</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> On a magic carpet ride</span>
(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> A whole new world!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> A new fantastic point of view</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> No one to tell us no</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Or where to go</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Or say we’re only dreaming</span>
(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight. CARPET <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">flies in and out of the clouds.)</span>
JASMINE: A whole new world <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">A dazzling place I never knew</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> But when I’m way up here</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> It’s crystal clear </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">That now I’m in a whole new world with you!</span>
ALADDIN: Now I’m in a whole new world with you!
(They each catch a small cloud as CARPET continues the flight. It <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">then circles a pillar of clouds, giving a swirly look to it.)</span>
JASMINE: (as Personal Slave Girl) Unbelievable sights <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Indescribable feeling</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Through an endless diamond sky</span>
(They join a flock of birds in the sky. One of them looks terrified <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">and squawks. CARPET does somersaults and flips, at times putting</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ALADDIN and</span> <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">JASMINE in free-fall, but catching them. They then</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> zoom above the clouds where a starry night awaits them.)</span>
JASMINE: A whole new world!
ALADDIN: Don’t you dare close your eyes
JASMINE: An hundred thousand things to see
ALADDIN: Hold your breath--it gets better!
JASMINE: I’m like a shooting star,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> I’ve come so far</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> I can’t go back to where I used to be!</span>
(They zoom down over a river, apparently the Nile, for beyond the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ship’s sails are the Great Pyramids. They wave at a worker</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> sculpting the complete nose of the Sphinx. He smiles, but</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> chisels too much and breaks off the front section of the nose.)</span>
ALADDIN: A whole new world!
JASMINE: Every turn a surprise
ALADDIN: With new horizons to pursue
JASMINE: Every moment, red-letter
(They fly alongside wild horses running. Personal Slave Girl JASMINE pets one of them.)
BOTH: I’ll chase them anywhere<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> There’s time to spare</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Let me share this whole new world with you</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> A whole new world</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> That’s where we’ll be</span>
(They fly through Greece, where ALADDIN grabs an apple from a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> tree and rolls it down his arm to Personal Slave Girl JASMINE, who is now sure</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> she is dealing with ALADDIN, not PRINCE ALI.)</span>
ALADDIN: A thrilling chase
JASMINE: A wondrous place
BOTH: For you and me!
(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the moon in the lake. Fireworks burst and we see the couple</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.)</span>
JASMINE: It’s all so magical.
ALADDIN: Yeah.
JASMINE: (She looks at him)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> It’s a shame Abu had to miss this.</span>
ALADDIN: Nah. He hates fireworks. (CARPET looks up<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> realizing what is happening.) He doesn’t really</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> That is…oh no!</span>
JASMINE: (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> market! I knew it. Why did you lie to me?</span>
ALADDIN: Jasmine, I’m sorry.
JASMINE: Did you think I was stupid?
ALADDIN: No!
JASMINE: That I wouldn’t figure it out?
ALADDIN: No. I mean, I hoped you wouldn’t. No, that’s not what I meant.
JASMINE: Who are you? Tell me the truth!
ALADDIN: The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> giving up hope.) The truth…the truth is…I</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> pressures of palace life. (CARPET slumps down in</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> defeat.) But I really am a prince! (The feather on</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> his turban falls down over his eyes.)</span>
JASMINE: Why didn’t you just tell me?
ALADDIN: Well, you know, um…royalty going out into the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> city in disguise, it sounds a little strange,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> don’t you think?</span>
JASMINE: Not that strange.
(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him. CARPET puts a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified. Dissolve to ext.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and</span> <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">JASMINE return. CARPET</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> forms a set of steps and she descends. ALADDIN then descends</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> just below the balcony.)</span>
JASMINE: Good night, my handsome prince.
ALADDIN: Sleep well, princess.
(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> kiss sooner than expected. She walks away slowly then turns and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.)</span>
ALADDIN: Yes! (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right.
(He looks up at Jasmine's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.)
ALADDIN: Hey! What? (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu! Abu! (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.)
ABU: Yes?
GUARD: Hold him!
(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands. Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.)
JAFAR: I’m afraid you’ve worn out your welcome, Prince<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Abooboo. (Walks away.) Make sure he’s</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> never found.</span>
(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious. Cut to a <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">cliff, where GUARDS laugh as Aladdin's body drops into the water.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock. The rock</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">out. He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp. However, he</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> loses consciousness and falls to the floor. The lamp, unsettled</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap)</span>
GENIE: Never fails. Get in the bath and there’s a rub at<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the lamp. (Squeaks the duck) Hello. (Sees</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> unconscious ALADDIN) Al? Al! Kid, snap out of it!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> You can’t cheat on this one! I can’t help you</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> unless you make a wish. You have to say "Genie I</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> want you to save my life." Got it? Okay. C’mon</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Aladdin!! (He grabs ALADDIN by the shoulders and </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">shakes him. His head goes up, then falls.) I’ll</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> take that as a yes. (Head turns into a siren.)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Wooga! Wooga! (Turns into a submarine.) Up</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> scope! (He babbles in something that sounds like</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> German. On the surface, a giant water spout</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> emerges, and lands on top of the cliff. ALADDIN</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> reawake</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">n</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">s and coughs the water out of his lungs.)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Don’t you scare me like that!</span>
ALADDIN: Genie, I--uh, I-uh…(He can’t think of how to say<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> it, so they just hug each other.) Thanks, Genie.</span>
GENIE: Oh, Al. I’m gettin’ kind of fond of you, kid. Not<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> that I want to pick out curtains or anything.</span>
(Cut to JASMINE in her room, humming "A Whole New World" and brushing<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> her hair. The SULTAN appears in one of the double doors, hypnotized.)</span>
SULTAN: Jasmine!
JASMINE: Oh, father--I just had the most wonderful time. I’m so happy.
SULTAN: (Still monotone from the hypnosis) You should be, Jasmine. I have chosen a husband for you.
JASMINE: What?
SULTAN: (The other door opens and reveals JAFAR.) You will wed Jafar.
(JASMINE gasps at the sight of him.)
JAFAR: You’re speechless, I see. A fine quality in a wife.
JASMINE: I will never marry you. (She goes to the SULTAN) Father, I choose Prince Ali!
JAFAR: Prince Ali left!
(A quick pan finds ALADDIN standing in the doorway to the balcony.)
ALADDIN: Better check your crystal ball again, Jafar!
JASMINE: Prince Ali!
(JAFAR gasps at the sight of ALADDIN.)
IAGO: How in the he--(back to parrot-ese)--uh, awk!
ALADDIN: Tell them the truth, Jafar. You tried to have me killed!
JAFAR: What? (He goes to the SULTAN) Ridiculous <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">nonsense, Your Highness. He is obviously lying.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (He brings the staff close to the SULTAN’s face.)</span>
SULTAN: Obviously…lying.
(ALADDIN sees the staff with its glowing eyes.)
JASMINE: Father, what’s wrong with you?
ALADDIN: I know what's wrong!
(ALADDIN grabs the staff and smashes it on the floor. JAFAR flinches and the spell is broken for good.)
SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my!
ALADDIN: Your Highness, Jafar’s been controlling you with this! (He advances the staff)
SULTAN: What? Jafar?! You, you traitor!
(The trio advances on JAFAR.)
JAFAR: Your majesty, all of this can be explained.
SULTAN: Guards! Guards!
IAGO: Well, that’s it--we’re dead, forget about it. Just dig a grave for both of us. We’re dead.
(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN’s pocket. He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.)
SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once.
JAFAR: This is not done yet, boy!
(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket. ALADDIN sees this and rushes <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor. A large red cloud </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">appears. When it is gone, so is JAFAR.)</span>
SULTAN: Find him! Search everywhere!
ALADDIN: Jasmine, are you all right?
JASMINE: Yes.
(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.)
SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> me all this time. Just horrible. How will I ever- </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">(He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Can this be true? My daughter has finally chosen a</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> suitor? (She nods) Ha ha! Praise Allah! You</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> brilliant boy, I could kiss you! I won’t--I’ll</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> leave that to my--. You two will be wed at once!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Yes, yes. And you’ll be happy and prosperous, and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> then my boy, you will be sultan!</span>
ALADDIN: Sultan?
SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> person of your unimpeachable moral character is</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> exactly what this kingdom needs! (ALADDIN looks</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> concerned at this.)</span>
(Cut to int. of JAFAR’s chambers. JAFAR and IAGO enter.)
IAGO: We gotta get outta here! We gotta get-- I gotta start packing, your highness. Only essentials (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.) Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself and JAFAR) and how about this picture? I don’t know--I think I’m making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he’s cracked. He’s gone nuts. (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.) Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip!
JAFAR: Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin, Aladdin! He has the lamp, Iago.
IAGO: Why that miserable--
JAFAR: But you are going to relieve him of it!
IAGO: Me?
(Cut to ext. of palace. ALADDIN is looking at the gardens.)
ALADDIN: Sultan? They want me to be sultan?
(GENIE comes out of lamp)
GENIE: Huzzah! Hail the conquering hero! (Turns into a one-man band. He sees ALADDIN walk away with his head hung. He stops, scratches his head, comes up with an idea, then zooms over to ALADDIN. He holds up his hands like a director scoping a picture and we look through them.) Aladdin, you’ve just won the heart of the princess.  What are you gonna do next?  (ALADDIN looks at him, then walks away in sadness to the bed, where he falls on it and sighs  GENIE again is confused, then goes to him and pulls out a script labeled "Aladdin." Whispering:) Psst, your line is, "I’m going to free the genie." Anytime.
ALADDIN: Genie…I can’t.
GENIE: Sure you can. You just go, "Geeeeenie, IIIIIII wiiiiish you<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> free." (He grabs ALADDIN’s head and uses </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">him as a mock ventriloquist’s dummy. ALADDIN pulls away.)</span>
ALADDIN: I’m serious! Look, I’m sorry--I really am. But<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> they want to make me sultan--no! They want to make</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Prince Ali sultan. Without you, I’m just Aladdin.</span>
GENIE: Al, you won!
ALADDIN: Because of you! The only reason anyone thinks I’m worth <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">anything is because of you! What if they find out</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> I’m not really a prince? (Quietly) What if</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Jasmine finds out? I’d lose her. Genie, I-I can’t</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> keep this up on my own. I...I can’t wish you free.</span>
GENIE: (Sarcastically) Fine, I understand. After all,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> you’ve lied to everyone else. Hey, I was beginning</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> to feel left out. Now, if you’ll excuse me,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> master. (He says the last word in disgust, then</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> poofs back into the lamp.)</span>
(ABU and CARPET are watching from the window.)
ABU: Ohhh.
ALADDIN: Genie, I’m really sorry. (A tongue comes out of the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> spout and raspberries him.) Well, fine! (He covers the LAMP with a pillow.) Then just... stay in</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> there! (He looks at ABU and CARPET.) What are you</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> guys lookin' at? (They both leave.) Look, I... I-I’m</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> sorr--A-Abu, I’m sorry. I didn’t... </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">wait. C’mon! (He sighs.) What am I doing?</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Genie’s right. I... I-I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.</span>
JASMINE: (From a distance) Ali, oh Ali--will you come here?
ALADDIN: (Putting on his turban) Well, here goes. (He walks <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">into the garden.) Jasmine? Where are you?</span>
(We see IAGO wearing a beak and standing on stilts next to a FLAMINGO<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> in the pond. He is imitating JASMINE’s voice.)</span>
IAGO: Ahem--In the menagerie, hurry.
ALADDIN: I’m coming.
(We see ALADDIN hurry past, not noticing the birds. IAGO laughs,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> then turns back and looks into the face of a FLAMINGO, who is</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> panting.)</span>
FLAMINGO: D’uh!
IAGO: Ya got a problem, pinky? (He sweeps the bird’s <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">feet out from under it. IAGO runs into the palace</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> and finds the lamp under the pillow.) Boy, Jafar’s</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> gonna be happy to see you! (Stretches his face</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> like JAFAR’s and imitates it.) Good work, Iago!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (Normal) Ah, go on. (JAFAR) No, really--on a scale</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> of one to ten, you are an eleven! (Normal) Ah,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Jafar--you’re too kind. I’m embarrassed, I’m</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> blushing. (He flies away with the lamp.)</span>
(Cut to the palace entrance. The SULTAN is standing on top, making <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">an announcement to the people.)</span>
SULTAN: People of Agrabah, My daughter has finally chosen a<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> suitor!</span>
(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking. ALADDIN <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">appears at the bottom of the stairs.)</span>
ALADDIN: Jasmine?
JASMINE: Ali, where have you been?
ALADDIN: There’s something I’ve got to tell you.
JASMINE: The whole kingdom has turned out for father’s<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> announcement!</span>
ALADDIN: No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please!
JASMINE: Good luck! (She pushes him out onto the platform<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> crowd.)</span>
SULTAN: …Ali Ababwa!
ALADDIN: Oh, boy!
(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.)
IAGO: Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak.
JAFAR: Let them cheer. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">(He lifts the lamp and rubs it. GENIE comes out.)</span>
GENIE: You know Al, I’m getting (turns and sees JAFAR) <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">reallyyyyyy--I don’t think you’re him. (He </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">descends and consults a playbill.) Tonight, the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> sinister ugly man.</span>
JAFAR: I am your master now. (He throws GENIE to the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ground and puts his foot on GENIE’s face.)</span>
GENIE: I was afraid of that.
JAFAR: Genie, grant me my first wish. I wish to rule on <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">high, as sultan!!!</span>
(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle. The castle shakes. <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.)</span>
ALADDIN: Whoa!
SULTAN: Bless my soul. What is this? What is going on?
(His turban lifts off his head. When he grabs it, his whole body <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">shorts. The clothing reappears on JAFAR.)</span>
JAFAR: Heh heh heh!
SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer.
IAGO: That’s Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.
ALADDIN: Oh, yeah? Well, we’ll just see about that! (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty) The lamp!
JAFAR: Finders-keepers, Abooboo.
(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds.. ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE’s head.)
ALADDIN: Genie! No!
GENIE: Sorry, kid--I got a new master now. (He places the palace on top of a mountain.)
SULTAN: Jafar, I order you to stop!
JAFAR: There’s a new order now--my order! Finally, you will bow to me!
(The SULTAN bows, but JASMINE does not.)
JAFAR: We will never bow to you!
IAGO: Why am I not surprised?
JAFAR: If you won't bow before a sultan, then you will cower before a sorcerer! (To GENIE) Genie, my second wish--I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer in the world!
(GENIE extends his finger. ALADDIN tries to stop him, but he cannot,<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> and another GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt strikes JAFAR,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> returning him to his normal look.)</span>
<a href="/wiki/Iago_(Aladdin)" title="Iago (Aladdin)">IAGO</a>: Ladies and gentlemen, a warm Agrabah welcome for <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Sorcerer Jafar!</span>
JAFAR: Now where were we? Ah, yes--abject humiliation!<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> (He zaps JASMINE and the SULTAN with his staff, and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> they both bow to him. JAFAR snickers as RAJAH comes running at him.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> He zaps RAJAH, and the tiger turns into a kitty-</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">cat.) Down, boy! Oh, princess--(lifts her chin </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">with his staff)--there’s someone I’m dying to </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">introduce you to.</span>
ALADDIN: (off-camera) Jafar! Get your hands off her!
(JAFAR zaps ALADDIN. CARPET flies away.)
JAFAR: Prince Ali<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Yes, it is he,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> But not as you know him.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Read my lips and come to grips</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> With reality</span>
(JAFAR brings the two of them closer in the air.) <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">Yes, meet a blast from your past</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Whose lies were too good to last</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Say hello to your precious Prince Ali!</span>
(JAFAR zaps ALI back to ALADDIN.)
IAGO: Or should we say Aladdin?
JASMINE: Ali.
ALADDIN: Jasmine...
JASMINE: What?
Aladdin: I-I tried to tell you, I'm just--
JAFAR: So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Just a con, need I go on?</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Take it from me</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> His personality flaws</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Give me adequate cause </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">To send him packing on a one-way trip</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> So his prospects take a terminal dip</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> His assets frozen, the venue chosen</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Is the ends of the</span> <span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">E</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">arth, whoopeeeeeeeee!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> So looooooooooooong,</span>
<a href="/wiki/Iago_(Aladdin)" title="Iago (Aladdin)">IAGO</a>: Good bye, see ya!
JAFAR: Ex-Priiiiiiiince Aaaaaaaallllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!
(JAFAR has zapped ABU back to normal. He sends the two of them into<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> a tall pillar, then launches it like a rocket, but not before</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> CARPET can get in. F2B, then we see a snowy wasteland, where</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the pillar crashes and rolls. It finally comes to a stop.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ALADDIN emerges, obviously very cold.)</span>
ALADDIN: Abu? Abuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!
(He looks back at a shivering pile of<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> snow.) Oh, this is all my fault--I should have</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> freed the genie when I had the chance. (He digs</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> out ABU and crads him inside his vest.) Abu!</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Are you okay? I’m sorry, Abu. I-I made a mess of</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> everything... somehow. I gotta go back and set</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> things right. (He starts to walk through the snow,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> and he eventually steps on a frozen CARPET.)</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Carpet! (He looks up and sees CARPET is pinned by</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the pillar. He tugs to try and free CARPET. He</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> can’t do it, so he begins to remove snow from the </span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);">base of the pillar.) Abu, start digging! That’s</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> it! (Finally, enough snow has been removed, and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the pillar begins to roll. ALADDIN runs away,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> looks back, then slides into place. The pillar</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> rolls over him, and when it is gone, ALADDIN and</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> ABU are left sitting in the patch of snow made by</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the window of the pillar.) Yeah! All right! (He</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> looks up at his turban, made out of scared ABU.</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> CARPET shakes off the snow and rushes over to pick</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> them up.) Now, back to Agrabah! Let’s go!</span>
(We cut back to ext. long shot of Agrabah, shrouded in red clouds. Cut to int. and slow zoom of throne room. IAGO has the SULTAN tied up like a marionette, and JASMINE is chained next to the throne.)
IAGO: Puppet ruler want a cracker? Here’s your cracker. Shove ‘em all right down your throat. Here, have lots!
(JAFAR pulls the chain, and JASMINE walks up to him holding an apple.)
JASMINE: Stop it! Jafar, leave him alone!
(IAGO stops for a second, then continues.)
JAFAR: It pains me to see you reduced to this, Jasmine. (He takes a bite out of the apple she is holding.) A beautiful desert bloom such as yourself should be on the arm of the most powerful man in the world. (He waves his finger and a crown appears.) What do you say, my dear? Why, with you as my queen…
(She picks up a glass of wine and throws it in his face.)
JASMINE: Never!
JAFAR: I’ll teach you some respect! (She falls back as he raises his hand to slap her. Then he stops.) No. Genie... I have decided to make my final wish. I wish for Princess Jasmine to fall desperately in love with me.
(JASMINE gasps. We see ALADDIN race back into town.)
GENIE: (Again as Buckley) Ah, master-- there are a few addendas, some quid pro quo-
JAFAR: Don’t talk back to me, you stupid blue lout! You will do what I order you to do... slave!
(JASMINE looks up and sees ALADDIN in the window, motioning her to play along.)
JASMINE: (She stands and puts the crown on her head.) Jafar! Hm, I never realized how... incredibly handsome you are.
(The GENIE’s jaw drops.)
JAFAR: That’s better. (He pulls the GENIE’s jaw up like a shade.) Now... pussycat, tell me more about…myself.
JASMINE: You’re... tall... and dark...
JAFAR: Yes?
JASMINE: Well dressed…
(JAFAR walks over to her. ALADDIN jumps down with ABU and GENIE sees them.)
GENIE: Al! Al, little buddy!
ALADDIN: Shh!
GENIE: (Literally zips his mouth shut, then unzips it.)<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> Al, I can’t help you--I work for senor psychopath,</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> now. (His head turns into JAFAR’s, then back.)</span>
ALADDIN: Hey--I’m a street rat, remember? (He rezips GENIE’s mouth.) I’ll improvise.
(He slides down a pile of coins and hides close to JAFAR and JASMINE. JAFAR’s back is to ALADDIN.)
JAFAR: Go on.
JASMINE: And your beard…is so…twisted! (She has her<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> arms around him. She pretends to twist with her</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> finger, but she is actually motioning for ALADDIN</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> to come over. He makes his move. IAGO sees him.)</span>
IAGO: Jaf--mmmmmm! (ABU grabs him and covers his mouth.)
JAFAR: And the street rat?
JASMINE: What street rat?
(They are about to kiss when IAGO manages to knock over a bowl. JAFAR<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> turns to look, but JASMINE grabs him back and kisses him. ALADDIN</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> looks disgusted. IAGO and ABU both look disgusted.)</span>
ABU AND IAGO: Yuck!
JAFAR: That was--(he sees ALADDIN’s reflection in her crown.) You! How many times do I have to kill you, boy?!
(He zaps ALADDIN. JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground. ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.)
ALADDIN: Get the lamp!
(JASMINE runs to it. JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.)
JAFAR: Now! Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up!
ALADDIN: Jasmine!
(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.)
IAGO: Ooh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.)
(ABU rushes for the lamp.)
JAFAR: Don’t toy with me! (He’s zapped into a toy monkey.)
ALADDIN: Abu!
(CARPET rushes in.)
JAFAR: Things are unraveling fast now, boy! (JAFAR laughs as CARPET is zapped and unravels. ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.) Get the point? (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor. JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I’m just getting warmed up! (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.)
ALADDIN: Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake?!
JAFAR: A snake, am I? Perhaps you’d like to see how… snake-like I can be! (He smiles broadly, and we see a snake’s tongue come out from behind his teeth. He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN. The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR. Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing ‘A’ sweaters.)
GENIES: Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake!
JAFAR: You stay out of thissss!
(GENIE waving a tiny pennant with a ‘J’ on it.)
GENIE: (Weakly) Jafar, Jafar, he’s our man. If he can’t do it, GREAT!
(ALADDIN uses the distraction to make a break for the hourglass where JASMINE is trapped. However, JAFAR sees this and blocks the path. ALADDIN is thrown away, and he loses his sword.)
JASMINE: Aladdin!
(ALADDIN jumps on a large gem and slides across the floor, grabbing the sword on his way. He turns a corner, but the pursuing snake cannot, and the front half of JAFAR crashes through a wall and hangs outside the palace. ALADDIN jumps up on the snake’s back and stabs it. JAFAR screams in agony. ALADDIN again tries to free the princess.)
ALADDIN: Jasmine, hang on!
(He is about to hit the glass with his sword when JAFAR grabs him.)
JAFAR: (laughs hideously) You little fool! You thought you could defeat the most powerful being on Earth?!
IAGO: (with GENIE coming up behind him) Squeeze him, Jafar. Squeeze him like a--awk! (GENIE elbows him out of the way)
JAFAR: Without the genie, boy, you’re nothing!
ALADDIN: (Has an idea) The genie. The genie! The genie has more power than you’ll ever have!
JAFAR: What?!
ALADDIN: He gave you your power! He can take it away!
GENIE: Al, what are you doing? Why are you bringing me into this?
ALADDIN: Face it, Jafar! You’re still just... second best!
JAFAR: You’re right! His power does exceed my own. But not for long...
(JAFAR circles around the GENIE.)
GENIE: The boy is crazy. He’s a little punch drunk. One too many hits with the snake. (His hand turns into a snake and he hits his head with it.)
JAFAR: Slave! I make my third wish! I wish to be... an all-powerful genie!
GENIE: (Reluctantly) All right, your wish is my command. Way to go, Al.
(GENIE zaps JAFAR with the last GENIE (tm) brand lightning bolt. JAFAR’s snake form dissipates and he turns into a genie. We see JASMINE’s raised hand disappear under the sand. ALADDIN runs over and finally smashes the glass. Sand and Princess Jasmine pour out.)
JAFAR: Yes... Yes! The power... The absolute power!
JASMINE: (to ALADDIN) What have you done?
ALADDIN: Trust me!
(A black lamp appears at JAFAR’s base. JAFAR is busy conjuring.)
JAFAR: The universe is mine to command! To control!
ALADDIN: Not so fast, Jafar! Aren’t you forgetting something?
JAFAR: (looks down questioningly) Huh?
ALADDIN: You wanna be a genie? You got it!
(Shackles appear on JAFAR’s wrists.)
JAFAR: What?!
ALADDIN: And everything that goes with it!
JAFAR: No! NO!!!
IAGO: I’m gettin’ out of here!
ALADDIN: Phenomenal cosmic powers!
(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.)
IAGO: Hey, c'mon, YOU'RE the genie! I don't want, I don't--!
ALADDIN: Itty bitty living space.
GENIE: Al, you little genius, you!
(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> and RAJAH are standing together. RAJAH jumps up into the arms of</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> the SULTAN, then they are all transformed. The SULTAN is crushed</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> because of the weight of the new RAJAH. The palace reappears</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> where it used to be in the city. ALADDIN is left holding the</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> new lamp.)</span>
JAFAR: (Both from inside the lamp.) Get your blasted beak out of my face!
IAGO: Oh, shut up, you moron!
JAFAR: Don’t tell me to shut up!
GENIE: Allow me. (He takes the lamp and goes to the<span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> balcony. He is now wearing a baseball cap. He</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> palm flat and flicks it out into the desert</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> with his finger.) Ten thousand years in a cave of</span><span style="background-color:rgb(242,242,242);"> wonders ought to chill him out!</span>
<i>(Jafar and Iago continue to argue as they fade out. Jasmine walks over to Aladdin. They hold hands, but both look sad.)</i>
<b>Aladdin:</b> Jasmine, I’m sorry I lied to you about being a prince.
<b>Jasmine:</b> I know why you did.
<b>Aladdin:</b> Well, I guess…this… is goodbye? (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.)
<b>Jasmine:</b> Oh, that stupid law. This isn’t fair--I love you.
<b>Genie:</b> (Wipes away a tear) Al, no problem. You’ve still got one wish left. Just say the word and you’re a prince again.
<b>Aladdin:</b> But Genie, what about your freedom?
Genie: Hey, it’s only an eternity of servitude. This is love. (He leans down next to her.) Al, you’re not gonna find another girl like her in a million years. Believe me, I know. I’ve looked.
<b>Aladdin:</b> Jasmine, I do love you, but I’ve got to stop pretending to be something I’m not.
<b>Jasmine:</b> I understand.
(They take one final look into each other’s eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.)
<b>Aladdin:</b> Genie, I wish for your freedom.
<b>Genie:</b> One bona fide prince pedigree coming up. I--what?
<b>Aladdin:</b> (He holds the lamp up to GENIE.) Genie, you’re free!
(A transformation scene ensues, in which the shackles fall off GENIE’s wrist and the lamp falls uselessly to the ground. GENIE picks it up and looks at it.)
<b>Genie</b>: (He can’t believe it.) Heh, heh! I’m free. I’m free. (He hands the lamp to ALADDIN.) Quick, quick, wish for something outrageous. Say "I want the Nile." Wish for the Nile. Try that!
<b>Aladdin:</b> I wish for the Nile.
<b>Genie:</b> No way!! (Laughs hysterically. He bounces around the balcony like a pinball.) Oh does that feel good! I’m free! I’m free at last! I’m hittin’ the road. I’m off to see the world! I--
(He is packing a suitcase, but looks down and sees ALADDIN looking very sad.)
<b>Aladdin:</b> Genie, I’m--I’m gonna miss you.
<b>Genie:</b> Me too, Al. No matter what anybody says, you’ll always be a prince to me.
(They hug. The Sultan steps forward.)
<b>Sultan:</b> That’s right. You’ve certainly proven your worth as far as I’m concerned. It’s that law that’s the problem.
<b>Jasmine:</b> Father?
<b>Sultan:</b> Well, am I sultan or am I sultan? From this day forth, the princess shall marry whomever she deems worthy.
<b>Jasmine:</b> (She smiles widely and runs into ALADDIN’s arms.) Him! I choose… I choose you, Aladdin.
<b>Aladdin:</b> Ha, ha. Call me Al.
(They are about to kiss when giant blue hands pull everybody together. Genie is decked out in a Hawaiian shirt with golf clubs and a Goofy hat.)
<b>Genie:</b> Oh, all of ya. Come over here. Big group hug! Group hug, Ooh! Do you Mind if I kiss the monkey? (He kisses Abu.) Ooh, hairball! Well, I can’t do any more damage around this popsicle stand. I’m outta here! Good-bye, you two crazy lovebirds. Hey, Rugman: ciao! I’m history! No, I’m mythology! No, I don’t care what I am--I’m free!
(The Genie flies up into the blue sky leaving a trail of sparkles behind him. They cut (a jump cut to make matters worse to fireworks exploding over a nightscape. We tilt down and see Aladdin and Jasmine flying on Carpet.)
(They fly off into the moonlight, and after they have disappeared, the moon turns and reveals the GENIE’s laughing face. Suddenly the film is grabbed "off the projector", the GENIE lifts it up and looks at the audience.)
<b>Genie:</b> Made ya look.
(Drops the film back to normal, with the normal moon. Fade to black)
