<b>TURKEY:</b> I was invited for Christmas by some guy who spoke Swedish.
<b>GONZO:</b> Oh, brother.
<b>TURKEY:</b> Had a white chef's hat on. Sounds like a nice vacation.
<b>GONZO:</b> Hm-hmm, hm-hmm. Listen. That guy is a chef. Don't you realize it could be very dangerous for turkeys around here?
<b>TURKEY:</b> Not to worry, I'm a survivor.

<b>DOC:</b> Sorry to hear that. It's cold enough out there to freeze your Winnebago.
<b>MISS PIGGY:</b> Hello, Kermie? I've finished my shopping. Unfortunately, Jerome got the limo stuck in the snowbank... So I'll just have to catch a taxi to the farmhouse.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Listen, Piggy, there's a terrible storm outside, and I really think it's too dangerous to travel. So why don't you wait for the storm to end before you join us?
<b>MISS PIGGY:</b> Nonsense. And miss Christmas eve with <i>vous</i>? It's just a little bit of snow. See you soon! Bye-bye!
<b>MISS PIGGY:</b> (grunts) Yo, taxi!
<b>KERMIT:</b> I'm sure Miss Piggy will be all right. (gulp)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Kermit, you look worried. I know exactly what you need.
<i>[Fozzie punches Kermit's arm.]</i>
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Comedy.
<b>KERMIT:</b> What?
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Yeah, come on. Now's the time for you to meet my new partner.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Who's your new partner?
<b>FOZZIE:</b> A snowman.
<b>KERMIT:</b> The heck you say.
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Yeah. Come outside. We'll do our act for you.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Outside? Fozzie, it's too cold to go outside.
<b>FOZZIE:</b> It's not cold.
<b>KERMIT:</b> It is cold!
<b>FOZZIE:</b> It's not cold!
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> (shiver) Can I come in and warm up?
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Okay, so it's cold.
<b>KERMIT:</b> (stammers) I'm Kermit the Frog. You must be Fozzie's new partner.
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> I'll say! We're terrific!
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Yeah, yeah, come on. You are coming in a snowman, but you are going out a star.
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Hey, hey, everybody, would you like to see our new act?
<b>STATLER:</b> We'd love to see your act!
<b>WALDORF:</b> In fact, we'd hate to miss your act!
<b>STATLER:</b> In fact, we'd love to hate your act!
<b>STATLER &amp; WALDORF:</b> (laughing)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Statler? Waldorf? W-Where'd you guys come from?
<b>MA BEAR:</b> They're friends of mine, Fozzie. They come visit me every Christmas.
<b>FOZZIE:</b> (stammers) My own mother is friends with you guys?
<b>STATLER:</b> These two comics are made for each other.
<b>WALDORF:</b> Hm.
<b>STATLER:</b> The snowman is ice cold, and the bear's not so hot!
<b>STATLER &amp; WALDORF:</b> (laughing)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Oh, please...
<b>WALDORF:</b> After all, there's no business like snow business!
<b>STATLER &amp; WALDORF:</b> (laughing)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Come on, ignore them. Do the straight line. Here we go.
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> Okay. Hey, Fozzie!
<b>FOZZIE:</b> Yes, Mr. Snowman?
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> Did you hear about the church that burned down?
<b>STATLER &amp; WALDORF:</b> Holy smoke! (laugh)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> (whispering) That was our best joke.
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> That does it, Fozzie. Forget the act. I'm starting to melt. It's too hot in here.
<b>STATLER:</b> Well, you know what they say.
<b>WALDORF:</b> If you can't stand the heat, get out of the farmhouse!
<b>STATLER &amp; WALDORF:</b> (laughing)
<b>FOZZIE:</b> (sigh) Come on, you'll be okay on the back porch.
<b>DOC:</b> Boy, that storm is really getting worse.
<b>SPROCKET:</b> (moans)
<b>KERMIT:</b> Yeah, I hope Miss Piggy is okay.
<b>DOC:</b> There is one worried frog.
<b>COUNT:</b> That's one! One worried frog!
<b>ROBIN:</b> He's not the only one.
<b>COUNT:</b> That's two! Two worried frogs!
<b>SPROCKET:</b> (quizzical moan)
<b>DOC:</b> Search me. More small talk, I think. Hey, I'd better go out and get some firewood.
<b>SPROCKET:</b> (quizzical moan)
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Hi, there!
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Did you wish to talk to me about something, Mr. Cook, sir?
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Gee, nice kitchen.
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> Oof!
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Hey, are you gonna have cranberry sauce and mashed potatoes?
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Oh, boy.
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> I just wanna... I just wanna to hear about the whole meal.
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> But first, I want to give this little present to you.
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> It's chocolate-covered birdseed. I made it myself.
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> (speaking foreign language)
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> I wanted to give it to you because, well... I know that you're from Sweden, and it must be hard for you because...you're away from your family and loved ones during the holidays.
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> At Christmas, there are places and people and things that become...very, very special.
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose...
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> (singing in a foreign language)
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> (singing in a foreign language)
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Though it's been said many times, many ways... Merry Christmas...
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> (singing in a foreign language)
<b>BIG BIRD &amp; SWEDISH CHEF:</b> Merry Christmas... To you...
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Now then, Mr. Cook, tell me... Exactly what are you going to fix for Christmas dinner?
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> (speaking foreign language)
<b>BIG BIRD:</b> Shredded wheat and cranberry sauce? My absolute favorite!
<b>SWEDISH CHEF:</b> Yah.
<b>BEAUREGARD:</b> Going to be lots of snow for me to shovel tomorrow.
<b>KERMIT:</b> It's getting worse and worse out there.
<b>BEAUREGARD:</b> Aren't you glad you're in here all warm and toasty?
<b>KERMIT:</b> I just wish Miss Piggy were.
<b>BEAUREGARD:</b> Hm.
<b>MISS PIGGY:</b> Okay! When I yell, ''Three,'' gun it! One! Two! Three!
<b>DOC:</b> You're really worried about your friend, aren't you, Kermit?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Hmm? Oh, well, yeah, a little.
<b>DOC:</b> I'll tell you what. I'll go out looking for her.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Really? But... But you've never even met Miss Piggy.
<b>DOC:</b> We never met any of you until a little while ago. And now we're friends.
KERMIT: Oh.
See, Sprockey and I were gonna spend Christmas alone, but this is better! Now, what's your friend look like?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Well, to begin with, uh... She's a pig.
<b>DOC:</b> Well, up to a short while ago, I would have thought that strange. I'll give it a try.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Gee, thanks, Doc!
<b>SNOWMAN:</b> You'll be sorry! It's cold enough to freeze your Winnebago!
<b>KERMIT:</b> What a sweet guy.
<b>ROBIN:</b> Uncle Kermit!
<b>KERMIT:</b> Robin? Where are you?
<b>ROBIN:</b> In the cellar.
<b>KERMIT:</b> What are you doing down there?
<b>ROBIN:</b> I made a discovery.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Oh, yeah? Uh, what are-- What are you talking about?
<b>ROBIN:</b> Remember telling me about Fraggle holes?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Uh, so?
<b>ROBIN:</b> And how if I ever found one, we could go into Fraggle Rock and maybe meet some Fraggles?
<b>KERMIT:</b> So?
<b>ROBIN:</b> Is that one?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Ooh! Look at that. Well, it certainly looks like one. You never know where you're going to find these things.
<b>ROBIN:</b> Can we go in, Uncle Kermit?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Well, maybe just a little ways. See if we can meet anyone.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Watch your step, Robin.
<b>ROBIN:</b> Gee, it's kind of scary.
<b>KERMIT:</b> These are beautiful caves. Ooh...
<b>ROBIN:</b> Hey, Uncle Kermit, wait up.
<b>ROBIN:</b> Do you think this is really Fraggle Rock?
<b>KERMIT:</b> Wellm I dunno, but if I were a Fraggle, I think this is the kind of place I'd hang out.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Wait a second. I thought I heard something.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Guess not. Well, anyhow...
RED: 
Well, hi there.
GOBO: Hi, yourself!
- You're Fraggles.
<b>WEMBLEY:</b> I'll say.
<b>RED:</b> But you're not.
<b>WEMBLEY:</b> I'll say.
<b>KERMIT:</b> No, I'm Kermit. This is Robin. We're frogs.
- What's a frog?
<b>MOKEY:</b> They're frogs.
<b>WEMBLEY:</b> I'll say.
<b>BOOBER:</b> Don't touch them! Frogs are probably noted germ carriers.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Actually, we just came down here to wish you all a merry Christmas.
<b>BOOBER:</b> Thank you.
<b>MOKEY:</b> That's nice.
<b>WEMBLEY:</b> Um... What's Christmas?
- Yeah.
<b>ROBIN:</b> Don't you have Christmas?
- No.
<b>ROBIN:</b> That's when you gather together with the people you love...and you wish each other peace on earth.
<b>RED:</b> Oh, we have a time like that.
<b>MOKEY:</b> Yes, we do. As-as a matter of fact, we're celebrating it right now.
<b>MOKEY:</b> You see, we give each other little presents. I'm giving Boober this nice yellow pebble.
<b>RED:</b> And I gave Mokey that pebble last year.
<b>WEMBLEY:</b> And I gave it to Red the year before that!
<b>BOOBER:</b> And I gave it to you, Wembley, the year before that.
<b>GOBO:</b> That pebble's been a gift thirty-seven times.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Thirty-seven times?
<b>GOBO:</b> Yeah.

<b>ROBIN:</b> Gosh, that was fun.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Yeah. Well, it's nice to be with friends at Christmas.
<b>SCOOTER:</b> Kermit, we hear shouting outside. It could be Miss Piggy.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Oh, well, let's go.
Anyone see her out there?
<b>MA BEAR:</b> Well, at least the storm has eased up a bit.
<b>KERMIT:</b> Chef, why don't you make some hot soup? And Mrs. Bear, would you put some extra blankets on a bed?
<b>GONZO:</b> Wait a minute, there she is!
<b>KERMIT:</b> What?
<i>[A sled dog team pulls Miss Piggy and Doc up to the farmhouse.]</i>
<b>FLOYD:</b> Yeah, and she don't look bad! For a pig. (laughs)
<b>MISS PIGGY:</b> Merry Christmas, Kermie. Am I late?
<b>DOC:</b> I-I-I don't know how to explain this, but I was searching through the snow and suddenly...there was Miss Piggy with this costume for me.
<b>KERMIT:</b> You don't have to explain, Doc. If there's one thing Piggy knows, it's how to make an entrance.
