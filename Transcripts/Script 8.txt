When the boy was born...
<br/>  
... like all Spartans, he was inspected.
<br/>  
If he'd been small or puny
or sickly or misshapen...
<br/>  
... he would have been discarded.
<br/>  
From the time he could stand,
he was baptized in the fire of combat.
<br/>  
Taught never to retreat,
never to surrender.
<br/>  
Taught that death on the battlefield
in service to Sparta...
<br/>  
... was the greatest glory
he could achieve in his life.
<br/>  
At age 7, as is customary in Sparta...
<br/>  
... the boy was taken from his mother
and plunged into a world of violence.
<br/>  
Manufactured by 300 years
of Spartan warrior society...
<br/>  
... to create the finest soldiers
the world has ever known.
<br/>  
The agoge, as it's called,
forces the boy to fight.
<br/>  
Starves them, forces them to steal...
<br/>  
... and if necessary, to kill.
<br/>  
By rod and lash the boy was punished...
<br/>  
... taught to show no pain, no mercy.
<br/>  
Constantly tested, tossed into the wild.
<br/>  
Left to pit his wits and will
against nature's fury.
<br/>  
It was his initiation...
<br/>  
... his time in the wild...
<br/>  
... for he would return to his people
a Spartan...
<br/>  
... or not at all.
<br/>  
The wolf begins to circle the boy.
<br/>  
Claws of black steel...
<br/>  
... fur as dark night.
<br/>  
Eyes glowing red...
<br/>  
... jewels from the pit of hell itself.
<br/>  
The giant wolf sniffing...
<br/>  
... savoring the scent of the meal to come.
<br/>  
It's not fear that grips him...
<br/>  
... only a heightened sense of things.
<br/>  
The cold air in his lungs.
<br/>  
Windswept pines
moving against the coming night.
<br/>  
His hands are steady.
<br/>  
His form...
<br/>  
... perfect.
<br/>  
And so the boy, given up for dead...
<br/>  
... returns to his people,
to sacred Sparta, a king!
<br/>  
Our king, Leonidas!
<br/>  
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf and the winter cold.
<br/>  
And now, as then, a beast approaches.
<br/>  
Patient and confident,
savoring the meal to come.
<br/>  
But this beast
is made of men and horses...
<br/>  
...swords and spears.
<br/>  
An army of slaves, vast beyond imagining,
ready to devour tiny Greece.
<br/>  
Ready to snuff out the world's
one hope for reason and justice.
<br/>  
A beast approaches...
<br/>  
...and it was King Leonidas himself
who provoked it.
<br/>  
That's it.
<br/>  
Now, the more you sweat here,
the less you'll bleed in battle.
<br/>  
My father taught me...
<br/>  
...that fear is always a constant.
<br/>  
But accepting it...
<br/>  
...makes you stronger.
<br/>  
My queen.
<br/>  
A Persian emissary awaits Leonidas.
<br/>  
In the end...
<br/>  
...a Spartan's true strength
is the warrior next to him.
<br/>  
So give respect and honor to him,
and it will be returned to you.
<br/>  
First...
<br/>  
...you fight with your head.
- Then you fight with your heart.
<br/>  
What is it?
<br/>  
A Persian messenger awaits you.
<br/>  
Do not forget today's lesson.
<br/>  
- Respect and honor.
- Respect and honor.
<br/>  
Councilman Theron.
You found yourself needed, for once.
<br/>  
My king and queen,
I was just entertaining your guests.
<br/>  
I'm sure.
<br/>  
Before you speak, Persian...
<br/>  
...know that in Sparta everyone,
even a king's messenger...
<br/>  
...is held accountable
for the words of his voice.
<br/>  
Now, what message do you bring?
<br/>  
Earth and water.
<br/>  
You rode all the way from Persia
for earth and water?
<br/>  
Do not be coy or stupid, Persian.
You can afford neither in Sparta.
<br/>  
What makes this woman
think she can speak among men?
<br/>  
Because only Spartan women
give birth to real men.
<br/>  
Let us walk to cool our tongues.
<br/>  
If you value your lives
over your complete annihilation...
<br/>  
...listen carefully, Leonidas.
<br/>  
Xerxes conquers and controls
everything he rests his eyes upon.
<br/>  
He leads an army so massive,
it shakes the ground with its march.
<br/>  
So vast, it drinks the rivers dry.
<br/>  
All the God-King Xerxes requires is this:
<br/>  
A simple offering of earth and water...
<br/>  
...a token of Sparta's submission
to the will of Xerxes.
<br/>  
Submission.
<br/>  
Now, that's a bit of a problem.
<br/>  
See, rumor has it...
<br/>  
...the Athenians
have already turned you down.
<br/>  
And if those philosophers and boy-lovers
have found that kind of nerve, then...
<br/>  
- We must be diplomatic.
- And, of course, Spartans...
<br/>  
...have their reputation to consider.
<br/>  
Choose your next words carefully,
Leonidas.
<br/>  
They may be your last as king.
<br/>  
"Earth and water."
<br/>  
Madman. You're a madman.
<br/>  
Earth and water.
<br/>  
You'll find plenty of both down there.
<br/>  
No man, Persian or Greek,
no man threatens a messenger.
<br/>  
You bring the crowns and heads
of conquered kings to my city steps.
<br/>  
You insult my queen.
<br/>  
You threaten my people
with slavery and death.
<br/>  
Oh, I've chosen my words carefully,
Persian.
<br/>  
Perhaps you should have done the same.
<br/>  
This is blasphemy. This is madness!
<br/>  
Madness?
<br/>  
This is Sparta!
<br/>  
Welcome, Leonidas.
<br/>  
We have been expecting you.
<br/>  
The ephors, priests to the old gods.
<br/>  
Inbred swine.
<br/>  
More creature than man.
<br/>  
Creatures whom even Leonidas
must bribe and beg.
<br/>  
For no Spartan king has gone to war
without the ephors' blessing.
<br/>  
The Persians claim their forces
number in the millions.
<br/>  
I hope, for our sake, they exaggerate.
<br/>  
But there's no question, we face
the most massive army ever assembled.
<br/>  
Before your plan is heard...
<br/>  
...what do you offer?
<br/>  
We will use our superior fighting skills...
<br/>  
...and the terrain of Greece herself
to destroy them.
<br/>  
We will march north to the coast,
where I will make sure...
<br/>  
It is August, Leonidas.
The full moon approaches.
<br/>  
The sacred and ancient festival.
<br/>  
Sparta wages no war
at the time of the Carneia.
<br/>  
Sparta will burn!
<br/>  
Her men will die at arms...
<br/>  
...and her women and children
will be slaves or worse.
<br/>  
Now, we will block
the Persian coastal assault...
<br/>  
...by rebuilding the great Phocian Wall.
<br/>  
And from there, we will funnel them into
the mountain pass we call the Hot Gates.
<br/>  
Now, in that narrow corridor,
their numbers will count for nothing.
<br/>  
And wave after wave of Persian attack...
<br/>  
...will smash against Spartan shields.
<br/>  
Xerxes' losses will be so great,
his men so demoralized...
<br/>  
...he will have no choice
but to abandon his campaign.
<br/>  
We must consult the oracle.
<br/>  
Trust the gods, Leonidas.
<br/>  
I'd prefer you trusted your reason.
<br/>  
Your blasphemies...
<br/>  
...have cost us quite enough already.
<br/>  
Don't compound them.
<br/>  
We will consult the oracle.
<br/>  
Diseased old mystics.
<br/>  
Worthless remnants of a time
before Sparta's ascent from darkness.
<br/>  
Remnants of a senseless tradition.
<br/>  
Tradition even Leonidas cannot defy...
<br/>  
... for he must respect
the word of the ephors.
<br/>  
That is the law.
<br/>  
And no Spartan, subject or citizen,
man or woman...
<br/>  
... slave or king, is above the law.
<br/>  
The ephors choose only
the most beautiful Spartan girls...
<br/>  
... to live among them as oracles.
<br/>  
Their beauty is their curse...
<br/>  
... for the old wretches
have the needs of men...
<br/>  
... and souls as black as hell.
<br/>  
"Pray to the winds...
<br/>  
...Sparta will fall.
<br/>  
All Greece will fall.
<br/>  
Trust not in men...
<br/>  
...honor the gods.
<br/>  
Honor the Carneia."
<br/>  
The king's climb down is harder.
<br/>  
Pompous, inbred swine.
<br/>  
Worthless, diseased, rotten...
<br/>  
... corrupt.
<br/>  
Truly, you're in the god-king's
favor now...
<br/>  
...O wise and holy men.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
And when Sparta burns,
you shall bathe in gold.
<br/>  
Fresh oracles shall be delivered to you...
<br/>  
...daily...
<br/>  
...from every corner of the empire.
<br/>  
Your lips can finish
what your fingers have started.
<br/>  
Or has the oracle robbed you
of your desire as well?
<br/>  
It would take more than the words
of a drunken adolescent girl...
<br/>  
...to rob me of my desire for you.
<br/>  
Then why so distant?
<br/>  
Because it seems...
<br/>  
...though a slave and captive
of lecherous old men...
<br/>  
...the oracle's words
could set fire to all that I love.
<br/>  
So that is why my king loses sleep
and is forced from the warmth of his bed?
<br/>  
There's only one woman's words that
should affect the mood of my husband.
<br/>  
Those are mine.
<br/>  
Then what must a king do
to save his world...
<br/>  
...when the very laws he is sworn
to protect force him to do nothing?
<br/>  
It is not a question
of what a Spartan citizen should do...
<br/>  
...nor a husband, nor a king.
<br/>  
Instead ask yourself, my dearest love...
<br/>  
...what should a free man do?
<br/>  
- Is this all of them?
- As you ordered. Three hundred.
<br/>  
All with born sons to carry on their name.
<br/>  
We are with you, sire.
<br/>  
For Sparta. For freedom.
<br/>  
To the death.
<br/>  
He is your son.
<br/>  
He is too young
to have felt a woman's warmth.
<br/>  
I have others to replace him.
Astinos is as brave and ready as any.
<br/>  
No younger than we were the first time
you stood next to me in battle.
<br/>  
You are a good friend...
<br/>  
...but a better captain, there is none.
<br/>  
My good king.
<br/>  
My good king, the oracle has spoken.
<br/>  
The ephors have spoken.
There must be no march.
<br/>  
It is the law, my lord.
<br/>  
- The Spartan army must not go to war.
- Nor shall it.
<br/>  
I've issued no such orders.
<br/>  
I'm here just taking a stroll,
stretching my legs.
<br/>  
These 300 men
are my personal bodyguard.
<br/>  
Our army will stay in Sparta.
<br/>  
Where will you go?
<br/>  
I hadn't really thought about it...
<br/>  
...but now that you ask...
<br/>  
...I suppose I'll head north.
<br/>  
The Hot Gates?
<br/>  
Move out!
<br/>  
Move out!
<br/>  
What shall we do?
<br/>  
What can we do?
<br/>  
What can you do?
<br/>  
Sparta will need sons.
<br/>  
Spartan!
<br/>  
Yes, milady?
<br/>  
Come back with your shield...
<br/>  
...or on it.
<br/>  
Yes, milady.
<br/>  
"Goodbye, my love."
<br/>  
He doesn't say it.
<br/>  
There's no room for softness...
<br/>  
... not in Sparta.
<br/>  
No place for weakness.
<br/>  
Only the hard and strong
may call themselves Spartans.
<br/>  
Only the hard. Only the strong.
<br/>  
We march...
<br/>  
... for our lands, for our families,
for our freedoms.
<br/>  
We march.
<br/>  
Daxos.
<br/>  
- What a pleasant surprise.
- This morning's full of surprises, Leonidas.
<br/>  
- We've been tricked.
- Can't be more than a hundred.
<br/>  
- This is a surprise.
- Silence.
<br/>  
This isn't their army.
<br/>  
We heard Sparta was on the warpath
and we were eager to join forces.
<br/>  
If it is blood you seek,
you are welcome to join us.
<br/>  
But you bring only this handful
of soldiers against Xerxes?
<br/>  
I see I was wrong to expect Sparta's
commitment to at least match our own.
<br/>  
Doesn't it?
<br/>  
You, there.
<br/>  
What is your profession?
<br/>  
I'm a potter, sir.
<br/>  
And you, Arcadian.
What is your profession?
<br/>  
- Sculptor, sir.
- Sculptor.
<br/>  
- And you?
- Blacksmith.
<br/>  
Spartans! What is your profession?
<br/>  
You see, old friend?
<br/>  
I brought more soldiers than you did.
<br/>  
No sleep tonight...
<br/>  
... not for the king.
<br/>  
All his 40 years
have been a straight road...
<br/>  
... to this one gleaming moment
in destiny...
<br/>  
... this one radiant clash
of shield and spear...
<br/>  
... sword and bone, and flesh and blood.
<br/>  
His only regret...
<br/>  
... is that he has so few to sacrifice.
<br/>  
We're being followed.
<br/>  
It has followed us since Sparta.
<br/>  
My king! Look!
<br/>  
What happened here?
<br/>  
Where are all the people?
<br/>  
Persians.
<br/>  
I put their number at around 20.
<br/>  
A scouting party.
<br/>  
But these footprints...
<br/>  
Behind us!
<br/>  
Child!
<br/>  
It's quiet now.
<br/>  
They...
<br/>  
They came with beasts
from the blackness.
<br/>  
With their claws and fangs...
<br/>  
...they grabbed them.
<br/>  
Everyone...
<br/>  
...but me.
<br/>  
The villagers.
<br/>  
I found them.
<br/>  
Have the gods no mercy?
<br/>  
We are doomed.
<br/>  
Quiet yourself.
<br/>  
The child speaks of the Persian ghosts,
known from the ancient times.
<br/>  
They are the hunters of men's souls.
<br/>  
They cannot be killed or defeated.
<br/>  
Not this darkness. Not these lmmortals.
<br/>  
Immortals?
<br/>  
We'll put their name to the test.
<br/>  
Into the Hot Gates we march.
<br/>  
Into that narrow corridor we march...
<br/>  
... where Xerxes' numbers
count for nothing.
<br/>  
Spartans, citizen-soldiers, freed slaves.
<br/>  
Brave Greeks, all.
<br/>  
Brothers, fathers, sons...
<br/>  
... we march.
<br/>  
For honor's sake, for duty's sake,
for glory's sake, we march.
<br/>  
Look! Persians.
<br/>  
Into hell's mouth we march.
<br/>  
Let's watch these motherless dogs...
<br/>  
...as they're embraced by the loving arms
of Greece herself. Come.
<br/>  
True.
<br/>  
It does look like rain.
<br/>  
Zeus stabs the sky with thunderbolts...
<br/>  
... and batters the Persian ships
with hurricane wind.
<br/>  
Glorious.
<br/>  
Only one among us
keeps his Spartan reserve.
<br/>  
Only he.
<br/>  
Only our king.
<br/>  
My queen?
<br/>  
My queen...
<br/>  
...the courtyard is a more fitting place
for a married woman.
<br/>  
I'm afraid gossip and protocol...
<br/>  
...are the least of my worries now,
councilman.
<br/>  
Is such secrecy needed?
<br/>  
How am I to trust beyond the walls
of my own home?
<br/>  
Even here, Theron has eyes and ears
which fuel Sparta with doubt and fear.
<br/>  
You speak as if all Sparta
conspires against you.
<br/>  
I wish it were only against me.
<br/>  
Many on our council
would vote to give all we have...
<br/>  
...and follow Leonidas...
<br/>  
...but you must show them favor.
<br/>  
And you can arrange for me
to speak to the council?
<br/>  
If it is reason they want,
I will let them know.
<br/>  
Know what, my queen?
<br/>  
Freedom isn't free at all.
<br/>  
That it comes with the highest of costs,
the cost of blood.
<br/>  
I will do my best to gather our council.
<br/>  
And its chamber
shall be filled with your voice.
<br/>  
- I'm in your debt.
- No.
<br/>  
Leonidas is my king as well as yours.
<br/>  
I saw those ships smash on the rocks.
<br/>  
How can this be?
<br/>  
We saw but a fraction of the monster
that is Xerxes' army.
<br/>  
There can be no victory here.
<br/>  
Why do you smile?
<br/>  
Arcadian...
<br/>  
...I have fought countless times...
<br/>  
...yet I've never met an adversary
who could offer me...
<br/>  
...what we Spartans
call "a beautiful death."
<br/>  
I can only hope...
<br/>  
...with all the world's warriors
gathered against us...
<br/>  
...there might be one down there
who's up to the task.
<br/>  
Move!
<br/>  
Keep going, you dogs!
<br/>  
Move!
<br/>  
Forward, I say!
<br/>  
Stop here!
<br/>  
Who commands here?
<br/>  
I am the emissary...
<br/>  
...to the ruler of all the world...
<br/>  
...the god of gods, king of kings...
<br/>  
...and by that authority...
<br/>  
...I demand that someone
show me your commander.
<br/>  
Listen. Do you think the paltry dozen
you slew scares us?
<br/>  
These hills swarm with our scouts.
<br/>  
And do you think your pathetic wall
will do anything...
<br/>  
...except fall like a heap of dry leaves
in the face of...?
<br/>  
Our ancestors built this wall...
<br/>  
...using ancient stones
from the bosom of Greece herself.
<br/>  
And with a little Spartan help...
<br/>  
...your Persian scouts supplied the mortar.
<br/>  
You will pay for your barbarism!
<br/>  
My arm!
<br/>  
It's not yours anymore.
<br/>  
Go now. Run along and tell your Xerxes
he faces free men here...
<br/>  
...not slaves.
<br/>  
Do it quickly...
<br/>  
...before we decide to make our wall
just a little bit bigger.
<br/>  
No.
<br/>  
Not slaves.
<br/>  
Your women will be slaves.
<br/>  
Your sons, your daughters...
<br/>  
...your elders will be slaves!
<br/>  
But not you, no.
<br/>  
By noon this day you will be dead men.
<br/>  
A thousand nations of the Persian Empire
descend upon you.
<br/>  
Our arrows will blot out the sun.
<br/>  
Then we will fight in the shade.
<br/>  
The wall is solid.
<br/>  
It'll do the job of funneling the Persians
into the Hot Gates.
<br/>  
Have the men found any route
through the hills to our back?
<br/>  
None, sire.
<br/>  
There is such a route, good king.
<br/>  
Just pass that western ridge.
<br/>  
It's an old goat path.
<br/>  
The Persians could use it to outflank us.
<br/>  
Not one step closer, monster!
<br/>  
Wise king, I humbly request an audience.
<br/>  
- I'll skewer you where you stand.
- I gave no such order.
<br/>  
Forgive the captain.
<br/>  
He is a good soldier...
<br/>  
...but a bit short on manners.
<br/>  
There is nothing to forgive, brave king.
I know what I look like.
<br/>  
You wear the crimson of a Spartan.
<br/>  
I am Ephialtes, born of Sparta.
<br/>  
My mother's love
led my parents to flee Sparta...
<br/>  
...lest I be discarded.
<br/>  
Your shield and armor?
<br/>  
My father's, sir.
<br/>  
I beg you, bold king,
to permit me...
<br/>  
...to redeem my father's name
by serving you in combat.
<br/>  
My father trained me to feel no fear,
to make spear and shield and sword...
<br/>  
...as much a part of me
as my own beating heart.
<br/>  
I will earn my father's armor, noble king...
<br/>  
...by serving you in the battle.
<br/>  
A fine thrust.
<br/>  
I will kill many Persians.
<br/>  
Raise your shield.
<br/>  
- Sire?
- Raise your shield as high as you can.
<br/>  
Your father should have taught you
how our phalanx works.
<br/>  
We fight...
<br/>  
...as a single, impenetrable unit.
<br/>  
That is the source of our strength.
<br/>  
Each Spartan protects the man
to his left...
<br/>  
...from thigh to neck with his shield.
<br/>  
A single weak spot
and the phalanx shatters.
<br/>  
From thigh to neck, Ephialtes.
<br/>  
I am sorry, my friend.
<br/>  
- But not all of us were made to be soldiers.
- But I...
<br/>  
- lf you want to help in a Spartan victory...
- Yes.
<br/>  
...clear the battlefield of the dead,
tend the wounded, bring them water...
<br/>  
...but as for the fight itself...
<br/>  
...I cannot use you.
<br/>  
You...
<br/>  
Mother! Father! You were wrong!
<br/>  
You are wrong!
<br/>  
Leonidas! You are wrong!
<br/>  
Dispatch the Phocians to the goat path...
<br/>  
...and pray to the gods
nobody tells the Persians about it.
<br/>  
Earthquake.
<br/>  
No, captain.
<br/>  
Battle formations.
<br/>  
This is where we hold them.
<br/>  
This is where we fight!
<br/>  
This is where they die!
<br/>  
Earn these shields, boys!
<br/>  
Remember this day, men...
<br/>  
...for it will be yours for all time.
<br/>  
Spartans!
<br/>  
Lay down your weapons!
<br/>  
Persians!
<br/>  
Come and get them!
<br/>  
Hold!
<br/>  
Give them nothing...
<br/>  
...but take from them everything!
<br/>  
Steady!
<br/>  
Push!
<br/>  
Is that the best you can do?
<br/>  
Push! Push!
<br/>  
Now!
<br/>  
Push!
<br/>  
No prisoners!
<br/>  
No mercy!
<br/>  
They look thirsty.
<br/>  
Well, let's give them something to drink.
<br/>  
To the cliffs.
<br/>  
Halt.
<br/>  
Hell of a good start.
<br/>  
Tuck tail!
<br/>  
Persian cowards.
<br/>  
- What the hell are you laughing at?
- Well, you had to say it.
<br/>  
- What?
- "Fight in the shade."
<br/>  
Recover.
<br/>  
Today no Spartan dies.
<br/>  
Easy, son.
<br/>  
We do what we were trained to do...
<br/>  
... what we were bred to do...
<br/>  
... what we were born to do.
<br/>  
No prisoners. No mercy.
<br/>  
A good start.
<br/>  
- I was afraid you might not come.
- I'm sorry, my son is...
<br/>  
Is doing what children do best.
Please, don't apologize.
<br/>  
Your son starts the agoge next year.
<br/>  
That is always a difficult time
for a Spartan mother.
<br/>  
Yes, it will be hard. But also necessary.
<br/>  
You will speak before the council
in two days' time.
<br/>  
My husband does not have two days.
<br/>  
Think of the two days as a gift.
<br/>  
It's no secret...
<br/>  
...Theron wants what you control.
<br/>  
It's his voice you must silence.
<br/>  
Make him your ally...
<br/>  
...and you will have your victory.
<br/>  
Thank you.
<br/>  
You are wise as you are kind.
<br/>  
There's your mother.
<br/>  
You should keep a better eye on him
if he's to be king one day.
<br/>  
Be unfortunate if anything
were to happen to him.
<br/>  
Or to his beautiful mother.
<br/>  
No!
<br/>  
Our Greek comrades are begging
for a crack at the Persians, sire.
<br/>  
Good.
<br/>  
I've got something
I think they can handle.
<br/>  
Tell Daxos that I want him...
<br/>  
...and 20 of his best eager, sober
and ready for the next charge.
<br/>  
King Leonidas.
<br/>  
- Stelios, catch your breath, boy.
- Yes, milord.
<br/>  
The Persians are approaching.
<br/>  
A small contingent.
Too small for an attack.
<br/>  
- Captain, I leave you in charge.
- But sire...
<br/>  
Relax, old friend.
<br/>  
If they assassinate me,
all of Sparta goes to war.
<br/>  
Pray they're that stupid.
<br/>  
Pray...
<br/>  
...we're that lucky.
<br/>  
Besides...
<br/>  
...there's no reason we can't be civil...
<br/>  
...is there?
<br/>  
None, sire.
<br/>  
Let me guess.
<br/>  
You must be Xerxes.
<br/>  
Come, Leonidas.
<br/>  
Let us reason together.
<br/>  
It would be a regrettable waste...
<br/>  
...it would be nothing short of madness
were you, brave king...
<br/>  
...and your valiant troops to perish...
<br/>  
...all because of a simple
misunderstanding.
<br/>  
- There's much our cultures could share.
- Haven't you noticed?
<br/>  
We've been sharing our culture
with you all morning.
<br/>  
Yours is a fascinating tribe.
<br/>  
Even now you are defiant...
<br/>  
...in the face of annihilation
and the presence of a god.
<br/>  
It isn't wise to stand against me,
Leonidas.
<br/>  
Imagine what a horrible fate
awaits my enemies...
<br/>  
...when I would gladly kill
any of my own men for victory.
<br/>  
And I would die for any one of mine.
<br/>  
You Greeks take pride in your logic.
I suggest you employ it.
<br/>  
Consider the beautiful land
you so vigorously defend.
<br/>  
Picture it reduced to ash at my whim.
<br/>  
Consider the fate of your women.
<br/>  
Clearly you don't know our women.
<br/>  
I might as well have marched them up here,
judging by what I've seen.
<br/>  
You have many slaves, Xerxes...
<br/>  
...but few warriors.
<br/>  
It won't be long
before they fear my spears...
<br/>  
...more than your whips.
<br/>  
It's not the lash they fear...
<br/>  
...it is my divine power.
<br/>  
But I am a generous god.
I can make you rich beyond all measure.
<br/>  
I will make you warlord of all Greece.
<br/>  
You will carry my battle standard
to the heart of Europa.
<br/>  
Your Athenian rivals...
<br/>  
...will kneel at your feet...
<br/>  
...if you will but kneel at mine.
<br/>  
You are generous...
<br/>  
...as you are divine...
<br/>  
...O king of kings.
<br/>  
Such an offer
only a madman would refuse.
<br/>  
But the...
<br/>  
The idea of kneeling, it's...
<br/>  
You see, slaughtering
all those men of yours has...
<br/>  
Well, it's left a nasty cramp in my leg...
<br/>  
...so kneeling will be hard for me.
<br/>  
There will be no glory in your sacrifice.
<br/>  
I will erase even the memory of Sparta
from the histories.
<br/>  
Every piece of Greek parchment
shall be burned.
<br/>  
Every Greek historian and every scribe
shall have their eyes put out...
<br/>  
...and their tongues
cut from their mouths.
<br/>  
Why, uttering the very name of Sparta
or Leonidas will be punishable by death.
<br/>  
The world will never know
you existed at all.
<br/>  
The world will know
that free men stood against a tyrant.
<br/>  
That few stood against many.
<br/>  
And before this battle was over...
<br/>  
...that even a god-king can bleed.
<br/>  
You fought well today...
<br/>  
...for a woman.
<br/>  
As did you.
<br/>  
Maybe if I'm injured,
you'll be able to keep up with me.
<br/>  
Perhaps I was so far ahead
you couldn't see me.
<br/>  
More likely offering your backside
to the Thespians.
<br/>  
Jealousy...
<br/>  
...does not become you, my friend.
<br/>  
Move it, men!
<br/>  
Pile those Persians high.
<br/>  
For unless I miss my guess...
<br/>  
...we're in for one wild night.
<br/>  
They have served the dark will
of Persian kings for 500 years.
<br/>  
Eyes as dark as night.
<br/>  
Teeth filed to fangs.
<br/>  
Soulless.
<br/>  
The personal guard to King Xerxes himself.
The Persian warrior elite.
<br/>  
The deadliest fighting force in all of Asia:
<br/>  
The Immortals.
<br/>  
The god-king has betrayed a fatal flaw:
<br/>  
Hubris.
<br/>  
Easy to taunt, easy to trick.
<br/>  
Before wounds and weariness
have taken their toll...
<br/>  
... the mad king
throws the best he has at us.
<br/>  
Xerxes has taken the bait.
<br/>  
Spartans, push!
<br/>  
Immortals.
<br/>  
We put their name to the test.
<br/>  
Father!
<br/>  
My king!
<br/>  
Arcadians, now!
<br/>  
Go! Show the Spartans what we can do.
<br/>  
Go!
<br/>  
They shout and curse...
<br/>  
... stabbing wildly,
more brawlers than warriors.
<br/>  
They make a wondrous mess of things.
<br/>  
Brave amateurs, they do their part.
<br/>  
Immortals.
<br/>  
They fail our king's test.
<br/>  
And a man who fancies himself a god...
<br/>  
... feels a very human chill
crawl up his spine.
<br/>  
To our king!
<br/>  
And our honored dead.
<br/>  
Whom will Xerxes dare to send next?
Whom?!
<br/>  
There's nothing that can stop us now!
<br/>  
Even the king allows himself
to hope for more than glory.
<br/>  
Such mad hope, but there it is:
<br/>  
"Against Asia's endless hordes,
against all odds, we can do it.
<br/>  
We can hold the Hot Gates.
<br/>  
We can win. "
<br/>  
Dawn.
<br/>  
Whips crack. Barbarians howl.
<br/>  
Those behind cry, "Forward!"
<br/>  
Those in front cry, "Back!"
<br/>  
Our eyes bear witness
to the grotesque spectacle...
<br/>  
... coughed forth from the darkest corner
of Xerxes' empire.
<br/>  
When muscle failed...
<br/>  
... they turned to their magic.
<br/>  
One hundred nations descend upon us,
the armies of all Asia.
<br/>  
Funneled into this narrow corridor,
their numbers count for nothing.
<br/>  
They fall by the hundreds.
<br/>  
We send the severed bodies
and the fragile hearts back to Xerxes' feet.
<br/>  
King Xerxes is displeased
with his generals.
<br/>  
He disciplines them.
<br/>  
Xerxes dispatches his monsters
from half the world away.
<br/>  
They're clumsy beasts...
<br/>  
... and the piled Persian dead are slippery.
<br/>  
- You still here?
- Somebody's gotta watch your back.
<br/>  
Not now, I'm a little busy.
<br/>  
Regroup!
<br/>  
Astinos!
<br/>  
My son!
<br/>  
Astinos!
<br/>  
No!
<br/>  
Day wears on.
<br/>  
We lose few...
<br/>  
... but each felled is a friend,
or dearest blood.
<br/>  
And upon seeing the headless body
of his own young son...
<br/>  
... the captain breaks rank.
<br/>  
He goes wild, blood-drunk.
<br/>  
The captain's cries of pain
at the loss of his son...
<br/>  
... are more frightening to the enemy
than the deepest battle drums.
<br/>  
It takes three men to restrain him
and bring him back to our own.
<br/>  
The day is ours.
<br/>  
No songs are sung.
<br/>  
Your gods were cruel to shape you so,
friend Ephialtes.
<br/>  
The Spartans, too...
<br/>  
...were cruel to reject you.
<br/>  
But I am kind.
<br/>  
Everything you could ever desire...
<br/>  
...every happiness you can imagine...
<br/>  
...every pleasure your fellow Greeks
and your false gods have denied you...
<br/>  
...I will grant you.
<br/>  
For I am kind.
<br/>  
Embrace me as your king
and as your god.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
Lead my soldiers to the hidden path
that enters behind the cursed Spartans...
<br/>  
...and your joys will be endless.
<br/>  
Yes! I want it all.
<br/>  
Wealth. Women.
<br/>  
And one more thing...
<br/>  
...I want a uniform.
<br/>  
Done.
<br/>  
You will find...
<br/>  
...I am kind.
<br/>  
Unlike the cruel Leonidas,
who demanded that you stand...
<br/>  
...I require only...
<br/>  
...that you kneel.
<br/>  
Beautiful night.
<br/>  
Yes, but I did not ask you here
for small talk, Theron.
<br/>  
You can be sure of that.
<br/>  
You never spared words with me.
<br/>  
Can I offer you something?
A drink, perhaps?
<br/>  
Is it poison?
<br/>  
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
it's only water.
<br/>  
I'm told it's been arranged for you
to go before the council.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
I need your help in winning votes
to send the army north to our king.
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
I can see it,
the two of us standing together.
<br/>  
Me, politician. You, warrior.
Our voices as one.
<br/>  
But why would I want to do that?
<br/>  
It proves you care for a king who right now
fights for the very water we drink.
<br/>  
True.
<br/>  
But this is politics, not war.
<br/>  
Leonidas is an idealist.
<br/>  
I know your kind too well. You send men
to slaughter for your own gain.
<br/>  
Your husband, our king,
has taken 300 of our finest to slaughter.
<br/>  
He's broken our laws
and left without the council's consent.
<br/>  
- I'm simply a realist.
- You're an opportunist.
<br/>  
You're as foolish as Leonidas if you think
men don't have a price in this world.
<br/>  
All men are not created equal.
That's the Spartan code, my little queen.
<br/>  
I admire your passion.
<br/>  
But don't think that you...
<br/>  
...a woman, even a queen...
<br/>  
...can walk into the council chamber
and sway the minds of men.
<br/>  
I own that chamber...
<br/>  
...as if it were built with these hands.
<br/>  
I could crush
the life out of you right now.
<br/>  
You will go before the council,
but your words will fall on deaf ears.
<br/>  
Leonidas will receive no reinforcements,
and if he returns, without my help...
<br/>  
...he will go to jail or worse.
<br/>  
Do you love your Sparta?
<br/>  
Yes.
<br/>  
- And your king?
- I do.
<br/>  
Your husband fights for his land
and his love.
<br/>  
What do you have to offer...
<br/>  
...in return for my word
that I'll help you send our army north?
<br/>  
What does a realist want with his queen?
<br/>  
I think you know.
<br/>  
This will not be over quickly.
<br/>  
You will not enjoy this.
<br/>  
I'm not your king.
<br/>  
Dilios.
<br/>  
I trust that scratch
hasn't made you useless?
<br/>  
Hardly, my lord. It's just an eye.
<br/>  
The gods saw fit to grace me
with a spare.
<br/>  
My captain?
<br/>  
Curses the gods and mourns alone.
<br/>  
Leonidas!
<br/>  
We are undone.
Undone, I tell you. Destroyed.
<br/>  
Daxos, calm yourself.
<br/>  
Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals
to the hidden goat path behind us.
<br/>  
The Phocians you posted there
were scattered without a fight.
<br/>  
- This battle is over, Leonidas.
- This battle is over when I say it is over.
<br/>  
By morning, the lmmortals will surround us.
The Hot Gates will fall.
<br/>  
Spartans! Prepare for glory!
<br/>  
Glory? Have you gone mad?
<br/>  
There is no glory to be had now.
<br/>  
Only retreat or surrender. Or death.
<br/>  
Well, that's an easy choice
for us, Arcadian.
<br/>  
Spartans never retreat.
Spartans never surrender.
<br/>  
Go spread the word.
<br/>  
Let every Greek assembled
know the truth of this.
<br/>  
Let each among them
search his own soul.
<br/>  
And while you're at it, search your own.
<br/>  
My men will leave with me.
<br/>  
Godspeed, Leonidas.
<br/>  
Children!
<br/>  
Children.
<br/>  
Gather round.
<br/>  
No retreat, no surrender.
<br/>  
That is Spartan law.
<br/>  
And by Spartan law,
we will stand and fight...
<br/>  
...and die.
<br/>  
A new age has begun.
<br/>  
An age of freedom.
<br/>  
And all will know that 300 Spartans...
<br/>  
...gave their last breath to defend it.
<br/>  
My friend.
<br/>  
I have lived my entire life
without regret until now.
<br/>  
It's not that my son
gave up his life for his country.
<br/>  
It's just that I never told him
that I loved him the most.
<br/>  
That he stood by me with honor.
<br/>  
That he was all that was best in me.
<br/>  
My heart is broken for your loss.
<br/>  
Heart?
<br/>  
I have filled my heart...
<br/>  
...with hate.
<br/>  
Good.
<br/>  
Dilios...
<br/>  
...let's take a walk.
<br/>  
Yes, my lord.
<br/>  
But, sire, I am fit and ready for battle.
<br/>  
That you are, one of the finest.
<br/>  
But you have another talent
unlike any other Spartan.
<br/>  
You will deliver my final orders
to the council...
<br/>  
...with force and verve.
<br/>  
Tell them our story.
<br/>  
Make every Greek know
what happened here.
<br/>  
You'll have a grand tale to tell.
<br/>  
A tale of victory.
<br/>  
Victory.
<br/>  
Yes, my lord.
<br/>  
Sire, any message...?
<br/>  
For the queen?
<br/>  
None that need be spoken.
<br/>  
Hundreds leave.
<br/>  
A handful stay.
<br/>  
Only one looks back.
<br/>  
Spartans!
<br/>  
Ready your breakfast and eat hearty...
<br/>  
...for tonight we dine in hell!
<br/>  
May I give the floor now...
<br/>  
...to the wife of Leonidas
and queen of Sparta.
<br/>  
- What's this?
- This is nothing.
<br/>  
Councilmen...
<br/>  
...I stand before you
not only as your queen.
<br/>  
I come to you as a mother.
<br/>  
I come to you as a wife.
<br/>  
I come to you as a Spartan woman.
<br/>  
I come to you with great humility.
<br/>  
I am not here to represent Leonidas.
<br/>  
His actions speak louder
than my words ever could.
<br/>  
I am here for all those voices
which cannot be heard.
<br/>  
Mothers, daughters, fathers, sons.
<br/>  
Three hundred families
that bleed for our rights...
<br/>  
...and for the very principles
this room was built upon.
<br/>  
We are at war, gentlemen.
<br/>  
We must send the entire Spartan army
to aid our king...
<br/>  
...in the preservation of not just ourselves,
but of our children.
<br/>  
Send the army
for the preservation of liberty.
<br/>  
Send it for justice.
<br/>  
Send it for law and order.
<br/>  
Send it for reason.
<br/>  
But most importantly,
send our army for hope.
<br/>  
Hope that a king and his men have not
been wasted to the pages of history.
<br/>  
That their courage bonds us together.
<br/>  
That we are made stronger
by their actions...
<br/>  
...and that your choices today
reflect their bravery.
<br/>  
Three hundred.
<br/>  
We must send them.
<br/>  
Moving...
<br/>  
...eloquent, passionate.
<br/>  
But it doesn't change the fact
that your husband has brought war upon us.
<br/>  
You are wrong.
Xerxes brought it forth...
<br/>  
...and before that,
his father Darius at Marathon.
<br/>  
The Persians will not stop...
<br/>  
...until the only shelter we will find
is rubble and chaos.
<br/>  
This chamber needs no
history lesson, my queen.
<br/>  
Then what is the lesson
you would like to leave?
<br/>  
Shall I begin to enumerate all of them?
<br/>  
Honor. Duty. Glory.
<br/>  
You speak of honor, duty and glory?
<br/>  
But what of adultery?
<br/>  
- How dare you.
- How dare I?
<br/>  
Watch her carefully.
<br/>  
She is a trickster in true form.
<br/>  
Do not play with the members
of this sacred chamber, my queen.
<br/>  
Just hours ago,
you offered yourself to me.
<br/>  
Were I a weaker man,
I would have her scent on me still.
<br/>  
- This is outrage.
- Oh, the hypocrite speaks!
<br/>  
Did you not receive a similar payment,
which you took...
<br/>  
...in exchange for her having an audience
with these noble men?
<br/>  
- That is a lie.
- Is it?
<br/>  
Was he not, by your invitation,
asked to come to the king's bedchamber?
<br/>  
The very bed where you attempted
to negotiate with me so vigorously?
<br/>  
You look shocked.
A bribe of the flesh, gentlemen...
<br/>  
...while her husband
promotes anarchy and war.
<br/>  
He speaks truth.
<br/>  
Words escape
even the most cunning tongue...
<br/>  
...my little whore queen.
<br/>  
What queen-like behavior.
<br/>  
Remove her from this chamber
before she infects us further...
<br/>  
...with her inglorious and shabby self.
<br/>  
This will not be over quickly.
<br/>  
You will not enjoy this.
I am not your queen.
<br/>  
Traitor.
<br/>  
Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!
<br/>  
Traitor!
<br/>  
Leonidas, my compliments
and congratulations.
<br/>  
You surely have turned calamity
into victory.
<br/>  
Despite your insufferable arrogance...
<br/>  
...the god-king has come
to admire Spartan valor and fighting skill.
<br/>  
You will make a mighty ally.
<br/>  
Yield, Leonidas.
<br/>  
Use your reason. Think of your men.
<br/>  
I beg you.
<br/>  
Listen to your fellow Greek.
<br/>  
He can attest
to the divine one's generosity.
<br/>  
Despite your several insults,
despite your horrid blasphemies...
<br/>  
...the lord of hosts
is prepared to forgive all...
<br/>  
...and more, to reward your service.
<br/>  
You fight for your lands.
<br/>  
Keep them.
<br/>  
You fight for Sparta.
<br/>  
She will be wealthier and more powerful
than ever before.
<br/>  
You fight for your kingship.
<br/>  
You will be proclaimed warlord
of all Greece...
<br/>  
...answerable only
to the one true master of the world.
<br/>  
Leonidas, your victory will be complete...
<br/>  
...if you but lay down your arms...
<br/>  
...and kneel to holy Xerxes.
<br/>  
It's been more than 30 years
since the wolf in the winter cold.
<br/>  
And now, as then,
it's not fear that grips him...
<br/>  
... only restlessness.
A heightened sense of things.
<br/>  
The seaborne breeze coolly kissing
the sweat at his chest and neck.
<br/>  
Gulls cawing...
<br/>  
... complaining even as they feast
on the thousands of floating dead.
<br/>  
The steady breathing
of the 300 at his back...
<br/>  
... ready to die for him
without a moment's pause.
<br/>  
Every one of them...
<br/>  
... ready to die.
<br/>  
His helmet is stifling.
<br/>  
His shield is heavy.
<br/>  
Your spear.
<br/>  
You there...
<br/>  
...Ephialtes.
<br/>  
May you live forever.
<br/>  
Leonidas, your spear.
<br/>  
Stelios!
<br/>  
Slaughter them!
<br/>  
His helmet was stifling.
<br/>  
It narrowed his vision,
and he must see far.
<br/>  
His shield was heavy.
It threw him off balance...
<br/>  
... and his target is far away.
<br/>  
The old ones say we Spartans
are descended from Hercules himself.
<br/>  
Bold Leonidas gives testament
to our bloodline.
<br/>  
His roar is long and loud.
<br/>  
My king.
<br/>  
It's an honor to die at your side.
<br/>  
It's an honor to have lived at yours.
<br/>  
My queen!
<br/>  
My wife.
<br/>  
My love.
<br/>  
"Remember us."
<br/>  
As simple an order as a king can give.
<br/>  
"Remember why we died."
<br/>  
For he did not wish tribute or song...
<br/>  
...nor monuments,
nor poems of war and valor.
<br/>  
His wish was simple.
<br/>  
"Remember us"...
<br/>  
...he said to me.
<br/>  
That was his hope.
<br/>  
Should any free soul
come across that place...
<br/>  
... in all the countless
centuries yet to be...
<br/>  
... may all our voices...
<br/>  
... whisper to you
from the ageless stones.
<br/>  
Go tell the Spartans, passerby...
<br/>  
... that here, by Spartan law, we lie.
<br/>  
And so my king died...
<br/>  
... and my brothers died...
<br/>  
...barely a year ago.
<br/>  
Long I pondered my king's
cryptic talk of victory.
<br/>  
Time has proven him wise.
<br/>  
For from free Greek to free Greek...
<br/>  
...the word was spread
that bold Leonidas and his 300...
<br/>  
...so far from home...
<br/>  
...laid down their lives
not just for Sparta...
<br/>  
...but for all Greece
and the promise this country holds.
<br/>  
Now, here on this rugged patch of earth
called Plataea...
<br/>  
...Xerxes' hordes face obliteration!
<br/>  
Just there the barbarians huddle...
<br/>  
...sheer terror gripping tight their hearts...
<br/>  
...with icy fingers...
<br/>  
...knowing full well
what merciless horrors they suffered...
<br/>  
...at the swords and spears of 300.
<br/>  
Yet they stare now across the plain
at 10,000 Spartans...
<br/>  
...commanding 30,000 free Greeks!
<br/>  
The enemy outnumber us
a paltry three to one.
<br/>  
Good odds for any Greek.
<br/>  
This day, we rescue a world
from mysticism and tyranny...
<br/>  
...and usher in a future
brighter than anything we can imagine.
<br/>  
Give thanks, men...
<br/>  
...to Leonidas and the brave 300.
<br/>  
To victory!
