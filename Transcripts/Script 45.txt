[<i>1989 – Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility and storms S.H.I.E.L.D's board room in the Triskelion</i>]
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: Stark.
<br/><b>Mitchell Carson</b>: He doesn’t seem happy.
<br/><b>Howard Stark</b>: Hello, Hank. You’re supposed to be in Moscow.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: I took a detour. [<i>he places a vial containing a red serum on the table</i>] Through your defense lab.
<br/><b>Peggy Carter</b>: Tell me that isn’t what I think it is.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.
<br/><b>Mitchell Carson</b>: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier…
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: I’m a scientist.
<br/><b>Howard Stark</b>: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?
<br/><b>Mitchell Carson</b>: If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: Oh, god. [<i>suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away</i>]
<br/><b>Peggy Carter</b>: Easy, Hank.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity. [<i>Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose</i>]
<br/><b>Howard Stark</b>: Don’t look at me, you said it.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: I formally tender my resignation.
<br/><b>Howard Stark</b>: We don’t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don’t let your past determine the future.
<br/><b>Dr. Hank Pym</b>: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [<i>Pym turns around and leaves calmly</i>]
<br/><b>Mitchell Carson</b>: We shouldn’t let him leave the building.
<br/><b>Peggy Carter</b>: You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?
<br/><b>Mitchell Carson</b>: Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work.
<br/><b>Howard Stark</b>: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.
[<i>Music plays as MARVEL appears on the screen</i>]
[<i>Present Day – Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy</i>]
<br/><b>Peachy</b>: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]
<br/>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [<i>Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn’t flinch</i>]
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: You didn’t even move.
<br/><b>Peachy</b>: Nah.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here… [<i>suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face</i>]
<br/><b>Peachy</b>: I’m gonna miss you, Scott.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: I’m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [<i>they shake hands</i>] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [<i>Scott says goodbye to the other inmates</i>]
[<i>Scott is escorted out of the prison and is met by his friend Luis</i>]
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Scotty! What’s up, man! Damn!
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Hey! Hey, man.
<br/>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [<i>they embrace each other</i>]
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Hey, what’s up with your eye?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going away present.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Oh yeah.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I’m still the only one to knock him out.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Well, I definitely didn’t.
<br/>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [<i>they get into Luis’s truck and drive off</i>]
[<i>as Luis drives him home</i>]
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Thanks for picking me up, brother.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Oh, you know, you think I’m gonna miss my cellie getting out?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Hey, how’s your girl, man?
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Uh, she left me.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Oh.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: It’s nice!
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Yeah, right?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: You wait ‘til you see this couch, you’re gonna be really happy. You’re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: I hope so.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Not interested.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Yeah right!
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: No, I’m serious, man. I’m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: You know that jobs don’t come easy for ex-cons, right?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, alright? I’m gonna be fine.
[<i>we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins</i>]

<br/><b>Ice Cream Store Customer</b>: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have… I’ll have a burger, please.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Oh, we don’t… we don’t make that.
<br/><b>Ice Cream Store Customer</b>: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard… in mustard dip?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: It’s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.
<br/><b>Ice Cream Store Customer</b>: I’ll just do with whatever’s hot and fresh.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Dude.
<br/>[<i>Scott’s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer</i>]
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh… [<i>points to the customer</i>] …take care of this idiot? Thanks.
[<i>Scott enters Dale’s office</i>]
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Hiya, Dale.
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Come on in. Pull up some chair.
<br/>&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; [<i>Scott sits down</i>]
<br/><b>Dale: </b>Three years in San Quentin, huh?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: You found out.
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Baskin Robbins always finds out.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Look, I’m sorry, alright, but I… no one would hire me.
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Look, I’m… I’m sorry, I… you know, it was… I don’t do it anymore. I’m just trying…
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Respect. I couldn’t be happier about it.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Really?
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Yeah, yeah.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Oh, thank you, thank you.
<br/><b>Dale</b>: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh!
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Well, I’m very happy in this job, and I’m… I really just appreciate the opportunities and…
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re fired of course. I mean, I can’t really keep you on.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Wait, what? Fired?
<br/><b>Dale</b>: Yeah.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker.
<br/><b>Dale</b>: No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.
[<i>after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis’s apartment</i>]
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: I was, I got fired.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Damn! They find out who you are?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Yep.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.
<br/><b>Dave</b>: Baskin Robbins don’t play.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: You want some waffles?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Yeah, I’ll take a waffle.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Oh. That’s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he’s a wizard on that laptop.
<br/><b>Kurt</b>: Nice to meet you.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [<i>to Dave</i>] And who are you?
<br/><b>Dave</b>: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.
<br/><b>Kurt</b>: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar.
<br/><b>Dave</b>: You mean you’re a pussy?
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: Yeah.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.
<br/><b>Dave</b>: Posts all the bank records online.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want?
<br/><b>Luis</b>: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: No way.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail.
<br/><b>Luis</b>: It’s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It’s a perfect Scott Lang mark.
<br/><b>Scott Lang</b>: I don’t care. I’m out.
