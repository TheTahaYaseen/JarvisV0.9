<b>Narrator</b>: Once upon a time, there was a princess (Child actress appears) and a peasant. (Orange tabby appears)
She lived atop of hill in a glittering castle. (Max opens the curtains and straightens his master's picture.) There, she had a servant who kept her castle in order, chose her daily robes for the day, prepared her royal breakfast, and served it to her in her dreamhouse. She had fame. She had fortune. She had (<i>clears throat</i>) product indorsements. But she was not what she seemed. (Darla and the animals smile) 
(Cuts to Kokomo, Indiana.) 
On the other hand, in a humble village far away, the peasant had none of her luxuries, but he had a dream. So, with a fond farewell from his closest friends and gifts of good luck, best wishes and useless junk, although it’s the thought that counts, his world was about to clash with hers in a place called: Hollywood!

<b>Frances</b>: I need a drink.
<b>Danny</b>: Let’s see go to Hollywood, check.
<b>Tillie</b>: Whatcha got there?
<b>Danny</b>: Well, I was hoping if I work really hard by Friday, I’ll land my first big part. Well, that’s how it worked for you guys, right?
<b>Frances and Cranston</b>: Oh, sure! Right!
<b>Cranston</b>: Why not Thursday?
<b>Tillie</b>: Now Danny I hear they’re casting a big Noah’s Ark movie. Lots of work for animals. Oh your tie looks crooked, let me fix you up. Good Luck. (<i>snort laughs</i>)

<b>Danny</b>: I am a cat!
<b>Farley</b>: How would you like to be in the next Darla Dimple picture?

(Sawyer opens the door, looking wet and annoyed from the fountain.)
<b>Tillie</b>: Sawyer? What happened to you? (<i>giggles</i>)
<b>T.W.</b>: Walk under a ladder? Sm-smash a mirror?
<b>Cranston</b>: Have you looked in one lately? (She is not amused.)
<b>Sawyer</b>: No, a cat crossed my path.

<b>Sawyer</b>: Farley Wink’s Animal Actors Agency, may I help you? You need a lamb for the Moses picture?
<b>Lamb</b>: Yeah!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Oh a sacrificial lamb?
<b>Lamb</b>: No, no…
<b>Sawyer</b>: Sorry fresh out. Everyday I ask myself, "Why do I put up with this?"
<b>Frances</b>: For the glamour.
<b>Sawyer</b>: What, this pigsty? No offense, Herb.
<b>Herb</b>: None taken.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Unless you're referring to the <i>glamour</i> of filing. The <i>romance</i> of typing. Tillie, what are you doing?
<b>Tillie</b>: Oh, I’m just fixing you up. You'll wanna look pretty in case you meet someone nice.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Yeah, right. As if he’s gonna come waltzing right through that- (Slammed in her face.) 
<b>Farley</b>: You’re gonna be fine, kid. You’re the cat’s meow. You can meow, can’t ya? (Snickers) WHERE’S SAWYER?! Ah, Sawyer, sweetie baby!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Whatever it is, the answer is no.
<b>Farley</b>: I'm in a bit of a jam.
<b>Sawyer</b>: (Collects her papers she dropped.) Too bad. 
<b>Farley</b>: Can’t find a female cat for the Ark picture.
<b>Sawyer</b>: (Removes cigar from Farley's mouth) Tough tabby. 
<b>Farley</b>: So guess who’s gonna fill in?
<b>Sawyer</b>: Hmm… you?
<b>Farley</b>: Nah, I only fill in for those dashing Clark Gable types.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Frankly, Clark, I don’t give a….
<b>Farley</b>: Sawyer!
<b>Sawyer</b>: I'm a secretary, not an actress.
<b>Farley</b>: Come on, I’ll give you Sundays off.
<b>Sawyer</b>: I never work Sundays.
<b>Farley</b>: I’ll pay you double time.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Triple time.
<b>Farley</b>: Triple time?!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Is there an echo in here?
<b>Farley</b>: You’re pushing me!
<b>Sawyer</b>: No chow, no meow.
<b>Farley</b>: Ok, ok, triple time! Here’s your partner he’s new in town be nice!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Ah, forget it!
<b>Farley</b>: Ah. ah, ah, a deal’s a deal. Now, get over to Mammoth Pictures! (snickers)
<b>Danny</b>: Wow you’re… you’re soaking wet! Is it raining outside? It was sunny when I came in. Oh let me get the door for you. Where I come from, you see clouds first, then the rain comes after it. Ha ha ha!
<b>Sawyer</b>: YEEOOOOOOOOWWWWWWW!!!!! (Glares at Danny)
<b>Danny</b>: Heh heh. sorry. Miss?
(<i>Cut to: Mammoth Pictures, with rolling clouds. The gates open to the studio in all its glory, as actors, actresses, stagehands carrying props, and secretaries shuffle around on the studio lot. Danny takes a fascinated gaze at Mammoth Tower as he catches up with Sawyer.</i>)
<b>Turkey</b>: Oh I’m tellin’ ya. One more plucking scene and… Pow! Right in the gizzard!
<b>Bull</b>: So aggravatin’ and humiliatin’. I’m outta this picture business.
<b>Toto</b>: There’s no place like home. There’s no place like home. There’s no place like… home.
<b>Danny</b>: Guess we’re gonna be the only two cats on the ark. Pretty great huh?
<b>Sawyer</b>: So much for preserving the species. Hey, Kong, how’s the picture coming?!
<b>King Kong</b>: Oooh! Don’t get me started! Ngggh!
<b>Danny</b>: You know the King? Wow.
<b>Tour Guide</b>: And there is the billboard for Darla Dimple’s next movie Li’l Ark Angel to premiere real soon!
(<i>Danny and Sawyer arrive at Stage 13, where the stagehands are busy preparing to film the movie.</i>)
<b>Stagehand 1</b>: All right, everybody! We’re ready for Darla’s big ark!
<b>Pudge</b>: Hey Mister! I can help you…. push that cart for you!
<b>Tough</b> <b>Guy</b>: Hey, get lost, kid.
<b>Pudge</b>: I’m little, but I’m strong! (<i>bending a straw</i>)
<b>Tough Guy</b>: (<i>dropping Pudge</i>) Hey, get out. These sweets are for Miss Dimple. (walks away)
<b>Pudge</b>: Ok, you don’t have to get mad. (<i>bumps into Danny</i>) Oh no I’m busted.
<b>Danny</b>: Hey.
<b>Pudge</b>: Hey your that cat from this morning aren’tcha?
<b>Danny</b>: Yeah what are you doing here?
<b>Pudge</b>: Oh, that ice thing is just my side job. Name’s Peabo Pudgemeyer. But you can call me Pudge. Ooh, time to start. Don’t forget your costume.

<b>Script Guy</b>: Script! Script! Script!
<b>Danny</b>: Meow? Is that all? Where’s the rest?
<b>Sawyer</b>: You’re looking at it.
<b>Danny</b>: But, I thought this was a musical. We’re supposed to sing and dance, aren’t we?
<b>Frances</b>: Oh, for the love of Moby Dick. (Danny glares at Frances.)
<b>Sawyer</b>: Listen, Tiger, this town has rules and around here, cats say "meow".
<b>Danny</b>: Oh, that’s so old hat! I’m sure nobody would mind if I jazz it up a bit.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Ok, learn it the hard way.
<b>Danny</b>: (<i>clears throat, in a British tone</i>) Meow. (<i>switches to a southern tone</i>) Meow! Dagnabbit, meow! (<i>switches to Edward G. Robinson</i>) Meow, see? Yeah, that’s it: Meow, meow. (<i>Sawyer looks at him with embarrassment, as a bell rings.</i>)

(<i>Danny looks around to see where the noise is coming from, until Max makes his entrance through the soundstage wall, scaring everyone. He even steps on a rubber duck and is able to catch Darla with his right hand.</i>)
<b>Max</b>: (<i>prying off Miss Dimple with his left hand</i>) Yes, Miss Dimpool?
<b>Darla</b>: (<i>breathes heavily and points at Danny madly</i>)
(<i>Max growls and cracks his knuckles.</i>)
<b>Cranston</b>: Nice knowing you, pal.
(<i>Danny is helpless as he sees the giant shape of the butler coming towards him. Danny falls backwards as Max picks him up. Poor Danny chokes along the way.</i>)

<b>Max</b>: Very gooooood! (<i>drops Danny back to the floor, causing a crater in front of Sawyer</i>) Will that be all, Miss Dimpool?

<b>Sawyer</b>: Oh I’ll do it. It’s about time someone talked to him. Since he’s tip-tapped into town he’s been nothing but trouble.
<b>Danny</b>: Well, I guess this is gonna set me back a whole day. Nah, maybe only half a day.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Look, Danny, I'm sorry your feelings got hurt, but the fact is, since you...
<b>Danny</b>: I don't get it. What happened in there, anyway? 
<b>Sawyer</b>: (annoyed) Oh...
<b>Danny</b>: Did I hit a sour note? 
<b>Sawyer</b>: Wait...
<b>Danny</b>: Because if I did, I could go back in there. I could fix it.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Danny! Danny, they don’t care. Don't you get it? What is it with you? Why are you so determined to make a fool of yourself?
<b>Danny</b>: What do you mean? All I wanna do is the thing I love. Doesn't everyone?
<b>Sawyer</b>: It's not that simple.
<b>Danny</b>: It is in Kokomo.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Then maybe that’s where you should of stayed.
<b>Pudge</b>: Hey Danny…. you want some?
<b>Danny</b>: No thanks Pudge.
<b>Pudge</b>: Oh I was gonna slug that big dumb Max for you but I don’t wanna hurt the guy. So what’s that Dimple kid’s problem? I thought you were great!
<b>Danny</b>: Glad you liked it.
<b>Pudge</b>: Oh you know all that a bob doo doo dee ya aaaah!
<b>Danny</b>: No it’s more like… well… I’ll show you.
(<i>piano music plays while Pudge and Danny dance</i>)
<b>Danny</b>: Wait a minute. Where-where’s that music coming from?
<b>Danny &amp; Pudge</b>: It’s him it’s Woolie the Mammoth! Aaaaah!
<b>Woolie</b>: A-ha! That’s it! B-Flat. Why, you have a natural rear for music, little fellow. Little fellow. (chortles) And, if my old eyes aren’t failing me, I’d say… you’re the fellow who caused that commotion today!
<b>Danny</b>: Yeah, I think I really upset Miss Dimple. (<i>chuckles nervously</i>)
<b>Woolie</b>: (<i>threatening</i>) Yes… you did. Jolly-good show! (<i>laughs</i>) Ah, tea time! Would you chaps like a cup?
<b>Danny</b>: Sure.
<b>Pudge</b>: Ok!
<b>Woolie</b>: Splendid! It’s a special peanut brew from India, the upper regions. (<i>His footsteps cause his trailer to lean to the side sending Danny and Pudge rolling to one side of the trailer, with Woolie’s piano crashing into them.</i>) Did you know that a peanut is not a nut at all? And, it’s not a pea for that matter either. (<i>The piano moves away as Danny mutters and sees birds flying around his head. He grabs onto Woolie’s gramophone for dear life.</i>) It’s rather odd that they call it a nut, because it isn’t a nut, you see, It’s-it’s… It’s a member of the legume family. Sugar?
<b>Pudge</b>: Yeah.
<b>Woolie</b>: (<i>cont.</i>) Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. How about pea legume? Nope, nope, nope, nope. That wouldn’t make sense either. But, whatever it is it makes a splendid tea. My great grandmother made this recipe, with certain additions from yours truly. Oh, I forgot the cream! Would you like some cream?
<b>Danny</b>: No, no, no!
<b>Pudge</b>: Don’t go to any trouble!
<b>Woolie</b>: All right, all right. Suit yourselves. Suit yourselves.
<b>Danny</b>: That music was great, Woolie. Did you write it for some movie?
<b>Woolie</b>: No, it’s not for any movie. I used to hope that one day, I’d write music for the motion pictures. But, all they want me for was to put on those beastly tusks and go (trumpets loudly) at the beginning of every film.
<b>Danny</b>: What a waste of your talent.
<b>Woolie</b>: Oh, it’s the same for everyone. Look behind you. So many broken dreams.
<b>Danny</b>: Is that Sawyer?
<b>Woolie</b>: Oh… poor Sawyer. I thought she’d be the one who would make it. Such a dancer with the voice of an angel.
<b>Danny</b>: Who would have guessed?
<b>Woolie</b>: That’s what this town does to you, my boy. It wears you down.
<b>Danny</b>: But, I thought Hollywood was looking for new talent-
<b>Woolie</b>: Ah, ah, ah. Talented <i>people</i>, not animals. (<i>sighs</i>) The spotlight will never be on fellows like you and me, and it’s foolish to think otherwise, Danny. Danny?
<b>Danny</b>: Yeah, foolish. Unless… (<i>plays tune on piano</i>) We could remind them!
<b>Woolie</b>: Of what?
<b>Danny</b>: Why they came here in the first place.
<b>Director</b>: Okay, listen up! I only need you water buffalo for the Tarzan jungle stampede. The rest of ay’s, go home!
<b>T.W</b>.: Well today’s shot. Might as well go home clean.
<b>Cranston</b>: Oh look who’s back! I wish he had himself stuffed.
<b>Frances</b>: I know a divine taxidermist darling. Did my first husband.
<b>Danny</b>: (<i>song: Animal Jam</i>) Hey everyone gather around! Don’t let this old town get you down. Look at you there with the long long face.
<b>Horse</b>: Hey! He must be talking to you!
<b>Danny</b>: You take this and you take that! Come over here T.W. and put on this hat! If we all work together we can make our dreams come true! Let’s show the world what we can do. Pudge?
<b>Pudge</b>: Yeah! (<i>plays drums</i>)
<b>Danny</b>: (<i>singing</i>): I got rhythm in my feet. I got rhythm in my heart and soul. Sometimes rhythm makes me loss control! Ha cha chattity cha! I….. want everyone to have all the fun I got rhythm So do you!
<b>Darla</b>: Perfect! How could you possibly improve a face like this? What is that hideous racket?
<b>Cranston</b>: Look at them! I’m ashamed to be an animal.
<b>Frances</b>: Oh shut up you old nanny and show Franny what you got.
<b>Cranston</b>: Come on, Sawyer. Grab a partner and do-si-do.
<b>Danny</b>: Hey, Sawyer, why don’t you sing? I hear your a natural.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Who told you that?
<b>Woolie</b>: (<i>trumpets</i>)
<b>Sawyer</b>: Come on, Danny, this is a waste of time! You’ll never dance in the movies.
<b>Danny</b>: Movies? Did I say movies? No, we’re just having fun, come on.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Yeah, sure, forget it.
<b>Danny</b>: Not bad, a little rusty, but hey, who’s perfect?
<b>Sawyer</b>: Rusty? I’ll give you rusty!
<b>Darla</b>: Look at those fools. Laughable isn’t it Max? Max? Max! Grrrr….
<b>Sawyer</b>: Like I said dancing’s a waste of time.
<b>Danny</b>: What if I gave you an audition with L.B. Mammoth?
<b>Sawyer</b>: L.B. Mammoth? Head of Mammoth Studios.
<b>Darla</b>: What?
<b>Danny</b>: I’m sure he’d appreciate real talent.
<b>Cranston</b>: After nothing but Darla he’s gonna be starving for it.
<b>Darla</b>: Grrrrr!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Your dreaming Danny.
<b>Danny</b>: Well maybe I am. But so were you. Just a few minutes ago. (<i>snap</i>)
<b>Pudge</b>: You really think you get us an audition with the boss Danny?
<b>Danny</b>: Hey it’s worth a try.
<b>Darla</b>: An audition? Max! (<i>snap</i>) Invite that cat. To teeeeeeaaa…. Thanks for coming over Donald.
<b>Danny</b>: Danny.
<b>Darla</b>: Oh, Danny. Animal cracker?
<b>Danny</b>: Uhh…
<b>Darla</b>: No more for me. I just wanted to apologize for what Max did the other day. He’s so bad sometimes.
<b>Max</b>: Ow…
<b>Danny</b>: No it’s ok you don’t have to.
<b>Darla</b>: No no no it was terrible, awful, cruel! Inapprotilaly violent. And I want to make it all up to you.
<b>Danny</b>: That’s ok you don’t….
<b>Darla</b>: Oh I insist! Is there anything you need?
<b>Danny</b>: No it’s….
<b>Darla</b>: Isn’t there something I could do for you?
<b>Danny</b>: No..
<b>Darla</b>: Isn’t there a certain someone who owns a certain studio that I could introduce you to?
<b>Danny</b>: Well can you do something for me and the other animals to work with L.B. Mammoth?
<b>Darla</b>: Why, Dennis! I’d be delighted. (<i>gasp</i>!) Idea.
<b>Max</b>: Ping.
<b>Darla</b>: Maybe you could do a number in my movie?
<b>Danny</b>: You mean it?
<b>Darla</b>: It’s just what the picture needs.
<b>Danny</b>: I couldn’t impose.
<b>Darla</b>: I’ll give you full use of my sound studio, my ark and anything else you may need.
<b>Danny</b>: Oh thank you Miss…
<b>Darla</b>: Ah, ah, ah call me Darla!
<b>Danny</b>: Thank you Darla!
<b>Darla</b>: Don’t mention it. (<i>giggles</i>)
<b>Danny</b>: Sawyer can do a romantic balled and Woolie can do his piano solo.
<b>Darla</b>: Did you hear that Max? Woolie, the elephant, could even play his solo!
<b>Max</b>: Grah…..
<b>Danny</b>: Don’t you think that would be a good idea?
<b>Darla</b>: Well I think…. do you really want my advice?
<b>Danny</b>: Oh yes oh yes please!
<b>Darla</b>: Well…..
<b>Max</b>: (<i>plays piano</i>)
<b>Darla</b>: (<i>song: Big and Loud part 1</i>) I’ve seen them come and I’ve seen them go, There’s one thing that I know, You gotta give the people what they want, Or you’ll wind up back in Kokomo Nebraska!
<b>Danny</b>: Uhh…. Indiana, Miss Dimple.
<b>Darla</b>: Whatever. (<i>singing</i>) They like it big, They like it loud, Maybe a little bit jazzy sometimes, Mr. Pussycat listen to me, You don’t have to be good, But you had better be……
<b>Max</b>: Get hot, Miss Dimple.
<b>Darla</b>: (<i>singing</i>) BIG AND LOUD!! Big and loud, (trumpet plays) Gonna make your momma proud! Make it big….. and….. loud! Leaves you kinda speechless don’t it?
<b>Danny</b>: Thank you Darla!
<b>Darla</b>: Oh no, no, no it was my pleasure. You just get all your little friends at Friday at 3 and I’ll take care of L.B. and let’s leave this between us shall we? I don’t like to advertise my charitable work.
<b>Danny</b>: Oh right. Thanks Miss Dimple! Thanks a lot!
<b>Darla</b>: Your welcome Dino.
<b>Danny</b>: Good-Bye!
<b>Darla</b>: Ta-ta see you in the movies.
<b>Operator</b>: Publicity Department?
<b>Darla</b>: Is L.B.’s big meeting still Friday at 3?
<b>Operator</b>: Yes it is, Miss Dimple.
<b>Darla</b>: Oh thank-you sooooo much. Ha! (<i>laughs evilly, song: Big and Loud part 2</i>) I didn’t get where I am today! By letting myself get pushed around! No man or beast or kitty-cat or doggie! Is going to drag me down!
<b>Max</b>: (<i>laughing evilly</i>)
<b>Darla</b>: Shut up, Max. (<i>singing</i>) The lightning will be blasting! The thunder it will roar! They’ll never know what hit ‘em! Wait’ll they see what I have in store… BIG AND LOUD! It’s gonna be big and loud! When they fall they’ll be blindfold! And they’re gonna fall big….

<b>Danny</b>: This is the big moment everyone! Just do it like you did in the alley. Only make it big and loud this time. Don’t be nervous.
<b>T.W.</b>: Nervous? Why would I be ner-nervous?
<b>Male rabbit</b>: Give me that!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Well, well, well, the big ark, use of Darla’s Ark costumes. I don’t know something smells fishy.
<b>Frances</b>: I beg your pardon!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Sorry it’s just that I smell a rat!
<b>Male rat</b>: Excuse me?
<b>Sawyer</b>: Oh never mind.
<b>Danny</b>: So, glad you came.
<b>Sawyer</b>: You did this? How?
<b>Danny</b>: Well let’s just say a little angel’s looking out for us. Your life isn’t back there in that office. It’s here with me.
<b>Pudge</b>: It’s 3:00 Danny!
<b>Danny</b>: Come on. Dance with me.
<b>Tilly</b>: So….
<b>Sawyer</b>: I can’t do this!
<b>Tilly</b>: And….
<b>Sawyer</b>: I’m not doing this!
<b>Tilly</b>: So…
<b>Sawyer</b>: I can’t believe I’m doing this.
<b>T.W.</b>: Fortune says "Rough waters ahead". (<i>shivers</i>)
<b>Danny</b>: Ok everyone. When L.B. shows up we’ll come out singing and dancing!
<b>Flanigan</b>: Thank you all for coming here. Now here to speak now is Mr. L.B. Mammoth! Boom chachalaca boom chachalaca boom!
<b>Reporter</b>: Gee Whiz, Mr. Mammoth! What’s the secret to your success?
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Simple. It’s Dimple. (<i>blows smoke cloud into form of Darla’s face</i>)
<b>Flanigan</b>: Dainty Delightful Darla Dimple!
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Ah, the recipe for a Darla Dimple movie. Begin with one part: Adorable character in jeopardy!
(<i>Back inside the soundstage, Darla has tied Pudge to a light bulb.</i>)
<b>Darla</b>: (<i>mocking Pudge</i>) Sorry, penguin; but in each life, a little rain must fall. Max! Man the valve!
<b>Max</b>: Yes, Miss Dimple. (opens the water valve)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Add in two parts: Perky determination!
<b>Darla</b>: More water, Max! More water!
(<i>Max opens the water valve even more, causing the shower heads to burst open.</i>)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Sprinkle in an air of innocence.
<b>Darla</b>: Wind, Max! We must have wind!
(<i>Max rips off the fan guard, grips one of the blades, and pushes it down, creating wind.</i>)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Stir in some….
<b>Darla</b>: More water!
(<i>Max rips off the water valve, sending gallons of water gushing out into the flood.</i>)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Add a pinch of…
<b>Darla</b>: Thunder!
(<i>Max grips a steam pipe, which starts bulging at the bottom. Two gauges and a bulb burn out, harming Pudge. The steam pipe eventually bursts, letting off steam.</i>)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Add an itsy-bitsy dash of…
<b>Darla</b>: Lightning!! (<i>evil laugh</i>)
(<i>Max slams the two lightning generators to create lightning.</i>)
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: Mix it all together and what do you get?
(<i>Back inside the soundstage, the flood is in full effect, as Pudge, still tried to the light bulb, drowns in the flood and Danny sees the impending chaos with terror. Mr. Mammoth presses the ‘Open’ button and sees a giant chamber of water inside the stage with Flanigan. Their gazes turn from curiosity to terror. Flanigan leaps into his boss’ arms.</i>)
<b>Flanigan</b>: (<i>panicking</i>) Mommy!
(<i>The two friends scream their heads off, followed by the reporters, who scream and run for their lives. Then, the massive flood spills into the open lot, engulfing Mr. Mammoth and Flanigan. Back on the ark, Danny is at the steering wheel as he tries to steer the ark, while Woolie clings onto the crow’s nest for dear life. The animal actors scream in terror as the ark does a corkscrew.</i>)
<b>Danny</b>: (<i>panicking</i>) Throw the anchor! Somebody, throw the anchor!
(<i>Tillie tosses the anchor that catches Flannigan and Mr. Mammoth.</i>)
<b>Tillie</b>: Oh, it’s L.B.! We’re on! Pack up your troubles in the old kit bag and smile, smile, smile! (<i>bashing T.W. and Frances together.</i>)
<b>Sawyer</b>: (<i>imitating Danny</i>) "Your life isn’t back there in that office." He says! "Dance with me." He says. (<i>nags at him.</i>) You know what your problem is?! You’re pushy, self centered, pig-headed- No offense, Herb.
<b>Herb</b>: None taken.
(<i>The flood approaches a Samson and Delilah movie set.</i>)
<b>Director</b>: We’re pushing, we’re pushing… We’re running, we’re running!
(<i>Danny and Sawyer are covered in Egyptian garb.</i>)
<b>Sawyer</b>: And, your driving stinks!
<b>Danny</b>: Oh then, maybe you could do better.
<b>Sawyer</b>: Oh no, no you take it.
<b>Cranston</b>: Well this can’t get any worse. I was wrong. It’s worse.
<b>Tilly</b>: (<i>gasp</i>) Oh this is an awkward moment. We haven’t formally met. I’m Tilly. Mr. Mammoth Cranston, Cranston Mr. Mammoth, Flanigan… Aaaaaah!
<b>Sawyer</b>: Oh, this has gone far enough! Just give me it!
<b>Danny</b>: Oh no no you didn’t want it before!
<b>Woolie</b>: Excuse me I don’t mean to sound rude but…..
<b>Danny &amp; Sawyer</b>: Will you just stay out of this?!
<b>Woolie</b>: Ooh, so sorry.
<b>Female</b> <b>Secretary</b>: Good day, Mr. Mammoth.
<b>L.B. Mammoth</b>: You animals will never…
<b>Flanigan</b>: Nibble kibble in this town again!
<b>Tilly</b>: I think they liked it.
<b>Danny</b>: But it wasn’t-! It wasn’t their fault.
<b>Darla</b>: Nice working with you, Danny. (<i>evil laugh</i>) Singing and dancing animals!
<b>Sawyer</b>: She was your little angel?
<b>Danny</b>: She said she wanted to help us.
<b>Tilly</b>: And you believed her?
<b>Danny</b>: No wait…
<b>Danny</b>: But I... Woolie, I would... I'd...
<b>Woolie</b>: The spotlight will never be on fellows like you and me. Go home, son. Go home.
<b>Cranston</b>: Goodbye, show biz. Hello, farm work.
<b>Tillie</b>: Well, there's always Broadway. Yeah, Broadway! I hear hippos are very very big on Broadway.
<b>Frances</b>: Their big everywhere darling.
<b>T.W</b>.: You know… this is all Danny’s fault.
<b>Cranston</b>: You got it brother. That toe-tapping tom!
<b>Frances</b>: I never trusted him. Too happy.
<b>Tillie</b>: Well, I have to admit, we were better off before.
<b>Cranston</b>: Well, let's face it. That cat ruined our already miserable lives.
<b>Tillie</b>: Well, he's just a... He's a crackerjack is what he is.
<b>Cranston</b>: She's right. You're doggone right.
<b>T.W.</b>: Nothing but trouble, that guy.
<b>Frances</b>: Horrid little being.
<b>Cranston</b>: Bad luck! Old happy feet better not show his face around here again.
