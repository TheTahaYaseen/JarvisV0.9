(After the blue FBI warnings, the black-and-gold Walt Disney Home Video logo appears)
("COMING SOON" flies down from the top of the screen, while "TO THEATERS" flies in from the left)
Brian Cummings: Coming soon to theaters.
((After the Walt Disney Pictures logo, the screen fades to a black background. Yellow subtitles read "10 Years Ago")
Mark Elliott: 10 years ago....
(After a silent clip of Ariel swimming up during "Part of Your World", the next set of subtitles reads "A Mermaid Dreamed of Life on a Land")
A mermaid dreamed of life on the land.
Ariel: I've never seen a human this close before.
(We see Eric and Max onscreen, with Max barking happily while Eric plays the flute and dances with him. The screen fades to the black background, with two more sets of subtitles reading "Now Her Daughter" and "Dreams of the Sea")
Mark Elliott: Now, her daughter...dreams of the sea.
Melody: You know what? Sometimes I even pretend...
(Sebastian puts his claw up to his ear while smirking)
I have...fins!
(Upon hearing this, Sebastian freezes up and faints. Then we cut to Melody jumping over him and diving into the ocean)
Mark Elliott: Get ready for a story unlike any other.
Ariel: This is the only fashion.
(We see Undertow leading Melody's rowboat to Morgana, along with silent clips of the mer-folk swimming up to the surface)
Melody can't know about mer-people or Atlantica...
(We see Ariel's hand giving King Triton Melody's necklace)
or even you, Daddy.
Melody: You're hiding something from me, aren't you?
Eric: (Sits on the bed with Ariel) Ariel, darling, we knew that this day would come.
(We cut to Morgana conjuring up a magic growth on Undertow)
Mark Elliott: It's an adventure you'll never forget.
Melody: What...what's going on?
Ariel: Melody?
(Upon seeing this, Sebastian gasps and runs to her in a panic)
Sebastian: <b>MELODY'S GONE! MELODY'S GONE!!</b>
Morgana: I'll succeed at the one fact my sister never could!
(Melody's mermaid tail turns back into legs)
Mark Elliott: Walt Disney Pictures proudly presents its 47th feature-length animated motion picture event.
Melody: I must figure this out! 
(Sebastian groans and he tries to climb onto the edge of the rowboat)
I know this necklace means something. If no one's gonna warn me, I'm gonna find out for myself!
(The movie logo appears as it ripples with the water)
Mark Elliott: "The Little Mermaid 2: Return to the Sea".
Sebastian: <b>I'M TOO OLD FOR THIS!!</b>
(We cut to a black background on the final note of the instrumental for "Down to the Sea", yellow subtitles appear, saying "Coming to Theaters Fall 2000")
("Atomic Dog" by George Clinton playing)
George Clinton: (sings) Yes, this is the story of a famous dog. For the dog that chases its tail will be dizzy. Like the boys, if they're out there walking the streets. May compete, nothing but the dog in you. Bow wow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Bow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Bow wow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Bow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Do the dogcatcher, baby, do the dogcatcher.
Cruella De Vil: Surprise.
George Clinton: (singing) Bow wow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Bow wow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Bow wow, yippee yo, yippee yay. Just walking the dog. Oh, atomic dog. Dogs of the world unite!
(The Walt Disney Pictures logo appears as thunder rumbles overhead. Then the screen fades, showing a hill in the shadows during a stormy night. This is the location of Kuzco's palace)
Don LaFontaine: Long ago, in a faraway land......
(Thunder booms overhead)
there was a prosperous kingdom...
(Thunder smashes overhead as we see the front of Kuzco's palace doorway)
ruled by a young emperor.
(We cut to Kuzco kicking the doors open)
Kuzco: Oh, yes! Boom, baby!
(We cut to Kuzco dancing outside the palace right next to the theme song guy)
Theme Song Guy: (sings) He's the sovereign lord of the nation...
Don LaFontaine: He had a serious attitude.
(Kuzco bumps into Rudy, causing the music to stop)
Kuzco: You threw away my groove! (Turns away, pouting)
Guard: I'm sorry, but you've thrown apart the emperor's groove.
(We cut to outside the palace, where from a distance, Rudy shrieks as he is thrown out)
Rudy: <b>I'M SORRY!!</b>
Don LaFontaine: An evil advisor.
Kuzco: (To Yzma) By the way, you're fired.
(We cut to Yzma destroying a stone of Kuzco's head with a giant mallet)
Yzma: I'll take over and rule the empire!
Don LaFontaine: And one major problem.
Lab Coat Yzma: (Holds up a pitcher of pink potion liquid) I'll just poison him with <i>this!</i>
Kuzco: (Drinks his glass) Ah!
(We see a clip of Kuzco's ears turning into llama ears)
Hey, Kronk! (Raises his glass) Can ya top me off, pal? Be a friend? (His noise, mouth and chin turn into a llama's snout) Ha-ha!
(Kronk hits Kuzco's head with a platter complete with broccoli)
Yzma: A llama?
(Kuzco faints headfirst)
<b>HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD!!</b>
Kronk: Yes, weird.
Yzma: Take him out of town and complete the job!
Don LaFontaine: Now...
(Kronk steps on a cat's tail and yelps as the cat yowls)
his only hope is a humble peasant.
Pacha: (Jumps backwards left and backs off) Demon llama!
Llama Kuzco: "Demon Llama"? (Turns to Misty) Where?
(Misty the llama shrieks, but Kuzco yells as he runs out of the bag)
You took me!
Pacha: Why would I take a llama?
Llama Kuzco: <i>You're</i> the criminal mastermind!
Pacha: What?!
Yzma: (Squishes Kronk's cheeks) Warn me Kuzco's dead.
(Kuzco walks into a bush and shrieks, but bounces off two tree trunks and lands on his front body)
Llama Kuzco: Ow!
(Kuzco gasps in horror as the camera pulls out, revealing he landed in front of a sleeping jaguar)
Kronk: Well, he's not as <i>dead</i> as he would've <i>hoped.</i>
(We cut back to Kuzco surrounded by the jaguars)
Llama Kuzco: Whoops.
(Bucky the Squirrel walks up to him from a vine, but pulls out a red balloon and blows it up. Then he makes a llama balloon animal out of it and plucks a thorn. Bucky chatters to Kuzco)
Llama Kuzco: No, no-no-no-no-no...
(Bucky chatters the alright and bursts the balloon. To Kuzco's surprise, they didn't awaken. After four seconds of silence, Kuzco yells)
Llama Kuzco: Ha! (Gasps in alarm and covers his mouth)
(The jaguars growl at Kuzco and Kuzco shrieks as he runs from them. We cut to Kuzco's neck smashing into at tree and spinning until he lands on a jaguar's back. The jaguar notices him on his back and stops. Kuzco yells as he flies away and is on the edge of a cliff face as the panthers slowly walk out of the bushes)
Baby Jaguar: Rreow!
(We cut to Kuzco about to be eaten, until they hear a Tarzan yell from Pacha swinging a vine. Kuzco grins frustratedly at them as Pacha's yell gets louder. Pacha swings past the jaguars, but later swings back for Kuzco and grabs him. Kuzco is heard shrieking as Pacha swings left)
Pacha: Don't worry, Your Highness, I have you! You're safe now!
(Pacha swings into a tree branch as he and Kuzco are tied up on separate ends)
Or not.
(The branch snaps apart and they shriek as they fall from the heavens. "Let's Groove Tonight" by Earth, Wind and Fire cues up as we transition over to Kuzco's servants painting Yzma over Kuzco on the walls and pottery until the iron Yzma's doors lock shut)
Llama Kuzco: No touchy. (Pacha headbutts into him and he hits a rocky wall)
Pacha: Why did I risk my life for a <i>selfish</i> brat like you?!
Llama Kuzco: Now I feel really bad. Bad llama!
Don LaFontaine: This holiday season......
(Pacha opens Kuzco's mouth and his tongue springs out)
Pacha: Ooh! Why me?
Don LaFontaine: The emperor has a new look...
(Kuzco's eyes spring open as Pacha puckers up, but they both shriek)
A new partner.
Pacha: We're gonna have to work together to get out of this. (Pushes against Kuzco)
Llama Kuzco: Ow! You did that on purpose. You know, it's a nice fact you're not a big <i>fat</i> guy, or this would be <i>really</i> difficult.
Don LaFontaine: And a brand new groove.
(Scorpions walk up on Kuzco's neck)
Llama Kuzco: Scorpions! (Shrieks and falls down)
Pacha: Kuzco!
(Pacha grabs his tail and Kuzco yells as he swings into a bat-cave, with his head stuck in it. The scorpions crawl down Pacha's back and bite him, making Pacha shriek in pain. We cut over to bats flying at Kuzco, and bursting him out of the cave as Kuzco spits the bats out of his mouth)
Don LaFontaine: Walt Disney Pictures presents...
(Pacha and Kuzco land on the edge of the cliff face safely, but look at each other and laugh shyly)
Llama Kuzco: Look at me and my naughty self. Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh!
(The title of the movie flies into the center of the screen)
Don LaFontaine: "The Emperor's New Groove".
(They both slide in the river)
Pacha: Uh-oh.
Llama Kuzco: Don't warn me. We're about to go over a huge waterfall.
Pacha: Yes.
Llama Kuzco: Sharp rocks at the bottom?
Pacha: Most likely.
Llama Kuzco: Bring it on.
(The log goes down the waterfall)
Boo-yah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Screen fades to black, but the words "December 2000" zoom out)
Don LaFontaine: December 2000 in theaters everywhere!
Kevin Michael Richardson: Something has taken over a third street school...something evil....something that threatens the future of the planet as we know it and there's only one group of people who can stop this.

Kevin Michael Richardson: In a Recess movie so big, it takes a theater to hold it.
T.J.: Mum! Mum! Oof!
Mrs. Detweiler: T.J., are you alright?
T.J.: These guys in the school. They're doing some kind of evil experiment.
Mrs. Detweiler: That bonk on the head must've rustled my little brain.
T.J.: But Mum...
Mrs. Detweiler: You're feverish. You wait right here. I'll go get the baby thermometer and the petroleum jelly.
Vince: Alright, that right there? That was messed up.
Kevin Michael Richardson: Now, a madman is putting into motion.

Dr. Phillium Benedict: Oh, dear, I have spittle on my lapel.
Kevin Michael Richardson: "Recess: School's Out".
T.J.: Dad! Dad! These evil bad guys have had a laser beam and they're lifting the safe!

Brian Cummings: Coming soon to theaters from Disney and Pixar.
Mr. Waternoose: Since the very first bedtime, all around the world, children have known that once their mothers and fathers tuck them in and shut off the light, that there are monsters hiding in their closets waiting to emerge. But what they don't know is it's nothing personal. It's just their job.
Mike: There's nobody here.
Sulley: What?
Mike: There's no boy, there's supposed to be a boy. There's no boy to frighten.
Sulley: Don't panic.
Mike: I'm panicking! Because there's a total lock of boy here!

Mike: Boys' bedroom.
Sulley: Boys' bedroom.

Sulley: (sighs) Magnolia? Give me that. It's Mongolia. Mike, does this look like Mongolia to you?
Mike: Yes, well, kind of.
Sulley: Well, alright. You remember the fifth grade?
Mike: Yes.
Sulley: If you spent all your time passing notes to Susie Boils,
Mike: Loved her.
Sulley: The rest of us were studying geography. This is not Mongolia.
Mike: Would you listen to this? Blame it on the little guy. How original. He must've read the schedule wrong with his one eye!
Sulley: Mike, c'mon, now, don't take it personally.
Mike: You were thinking that.
Sulley: C'mon, don't be so sensitive. C'mon, buddy, Little Blinky.
Mike: Don't do that.
Sulley: Who's your buddy?
Mike: I'm existing you.
Sulley: Who's your buddy?
Mike: Don't make me like you.
Sulley: C'mon.
Mike: I don't wanna like you right now.
Sulley: C'mon. C'mon.
Mike: Alright. (chuckles) Hey, guess what planet I am. Right? C'mon, look. Guess what planet I am.
Sulley: Alright, I'm gonna go back to the break room before all the donuts are gone.
Mike: Don't you even get it, you big throw rug? Oh. Nice doggy. Nice big doggy. Sulley? Sulley! Open the door! Open the door! <b>NoooooOOOO!!!!</b>

Buzz Lightyear: Let me take a look at that. Wow, a Buzz Lightyear movie.
Woody: What do you know? You don't look so fat when they draw you that way.
Buzz Lightyear: Uh-huh. Let's watch it.
Rex: Yes, please, quick, quick.
Woody: Buzz, we're not gonna watch the whole thing. We just wanna see all the commercials at the beginning.
Rex: What?
Buzz Lightyear: He's kidding, Rex.
Wheezy: Excuse me, Mr. Lightyear. You ought to sign that tape there. It might be worth something someday.
Rex: He can sign it later! Put it in! Put it in!
Woody: Darn thing's jammed.
Rex: Jammed? Oh, I can't stand the suspense. I can't. I just- I- Oh!
Hamm: Oh, boy!
Buzz Lightyear: Rex!
Woody: Gee, maybe we went too far.
Rex: Ha, ha! Just kidding!
Hamm: Ha, ha. Good one, Rex. Very good.
Buzz: This is the universe. I work here. Name's Lightyear, Buzz Lightyear. I'm a Space Ranger. My partner Warp Darkmatter and I... work out of Star Command's Universe Protection Unit. At 0800 hours the report came in. Missing: three little green men. Last seen: Star Command Science Bay. Alpha mission objective: locate L.G.M.s A.S.A.P. We'll find and rescue these little green men... even if we must go to infinity... and beyond. Buzz Lightyear mission log. We've searched this gaseous planetoid from top to bottom... with no sign of the missing personnel. - Hey! - Come on, buddy. Nobody ever reads those reports. Warp, my friend... procedure is what separates us from the wicked forces of chaos. Buzz, if it means less paperwork, I'll take chaos. Oh, man. Give it up, partner. This rock's as dead as it looks. Never judge a moon by its crater. - We'd better double-check the dark side. - I'll drive. Well, mission accomplished. Three L.G.M.s disappeared. We just found three L.G.M.s. Hmm. Well, I don't think these are the three missing L.G.M.s. Sure, not anymore. I'm afraid these three are stowaways. Ah, blast! This won't look good in my report. Hey! Must save the lost ones! Whoa, whoa, whoa. We'll find your amigos, boys. Just not here. Here! - How can you be so sure? - Mindlink. - Oh, come on! - Evil! Now you're just trying to freak us out. No, it's my worst fear come true. Here we go. This diabolical plot can only be the work of the sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance... evil Emperor Zurg! What plot? You think Zurg is behind every kitten stuck up a tree! The fiend! Why can't he leave kitty cats out of his nefarious schemes? We've searched half of the Zeta quadrant to find the missing L.G.M.s, and what do we find? A lot of nothing! There's something really bad behind me, isn't there? Crater viper! Look out! Hmm? Crater vipers never hunt in packs. Tell them that! Thanks, partner. Looks like this moon's not so dead after all! Give me a minute. It will be. - The lost ones! - What are you doing? Ooh! This way. - Warp, hit 'em from below! - Soft underbellies, eh? Let's see how ticklish. Of course! I should have guessed! A crater viper slag monster mutant! The L.G.M.s! Must save the lost ones. - Can't you just- - Warp, Gemini split now! Any reason you were looking to shake hands with a beast from 20,000 craters? The lost ones are there! Oh, well, then I'd say they're the dead ones now. Let's get out of here. Ha! I'm goin' in! - Follow my lead! - I hope you have a plan! No more so than usual. - Now what? - Full throttle! Hit it! The lost ones aren't in it! They're under it! Not... enough... power! All right. New plan! - That was your plan? - Most of it. - Where are the L.G.M.s? - Take a guess. Zurg! I knew it. Ow! - Anything? - No. Oh! He's not gonna like this. - Anything? - No. Oh! He's not going to like this. - Oh. Aah! - Uh, what should I tell him? We have proven that the little green men think and feel as one. We- ha, ha- just don't know how. Oh! He's not gonna like this at all. Oh! Now what? He, uh, he didn't like it. Evil Emperor Zurg! Hi. How are you? The torture tank is good to go here as you can see, and I- My bad. Ooh! Ow! Ow! - Ha, ha, ha! - We are one. We will never talk. Do your worst. My plan exactly. Blast! Laser-resistant diabonic alloy. Let me try. Yes? After you. Excuse us. Coming through. - Get back in the ship and wait. - No! Now, I know this is personal for you, but I must insist. No! Okay, we're getting into a chain of command area here, so really- We feel the pain. Ooh! Oh, oh, oh, right. It's their mindlink thing. How do you do that anyway? The Unimind. - Unimind? - The mystical orb that links all of L.G.M. kind. It's on their home world. Of course, that's need to know, classified. - I'm your partner. I need to know. - Now you do. - Anything else I should know? - I'd say you're up to speed. Okay, thank you. - Tell me of your mindlink. Tell me your secret. - Never! Oh. I will just have to pick your brains. Ha, ha, ha. Where's my cranial dissect-a-bot? Aaah! Oooh! Ah, Lightyear. Evil Emperor Zurg, by the authority of the Galactic Alliance... you are hereby charged with attempted dissection of Star Command personnel. I shall destroy your Galactic Alliance. But first, I shall destroy you! Well, not personally. Hornets, destroy Buzz Lightyear! Prepare to die, Buzz Lightyear! Not today, Zurg! Hop on! Whoa! Backup? Always a dramatic entrance, Warp. Let's go after Zurg! Not today, Lightyear, for I started the self-destruct sequence on my way out. It is a moon of doom now. Self-destruct in 60 seconds. - Sixty seconds? - All the time in the world. Uh-oh! Get to the ship! Blast off!. - But, Buzz! - That's an order! We'll meet you in orbit. Self-destruct in 45 seconds. Farewell, Lightyear! This time you shall not escape. just watch me, Zurg! Come on, Warp! It's time to blow this rock! Self-destruct in ten seconds. - Get out of here! - No! - Go! - We're partners! - Self-destruct in five... I said, "Go!" - Warp! - four, three... two, one. Space Ranger Warp Darkmatter sacrificed himself for the success of his mission... for the safety of his fellows. I miss him very much. Buzz Lightyear personal log. In his crazed attempt to destroy me... Zurg has robbed the universe of a good man... my partner, my friend. On this day I vow no ranger will ever again... fall in harm's way because of me. I work alone. Commander Nebula to training deck. Yeah, yeah, way ahead of ya. Cadet Florin, watch your tail, son! You people try that kind of hot-dogging in the field, and you're space dust! - Commander Nebula. - Ah, Lightyear. I got something I want you to see. All right, we're crankin' it up to level nine, people! Bring it on. Huh? Level nine? Commander? They're only rookies. - Come on. I train on level nine. - I know. Hey! Aah! Level... ten. Huh? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh! Okay. Oh! Well, I guess we couldn't expect a rookie to- Uh! It ain't over. - How did she do that? - She's from the planet Tangeah. Of course, Tangean ghosting powers. Excellent. Yeah, let's see one of Zurg's robots walk through a wall. Ranger Mira Nova reporting for duty, sirs. Mira Nova? Strange coincidence. Isn't that also the name of the heir to the Tangean throne? I met her once. - You saved my planet once. - Buzz, meet your new partner. Partner? Sir, what you did for my people- It inspired me to join. No! - No? - No what? No partner. Too risky. Look, son, I know you're still torn up about Warp... but next time you're out there- And Zurg aims for me? What's to keep the princess from ending up like Warp? Yeah, well, maybe it's the princess keepin' you from endin' up like Warp. Okay, hello? The princess has a name! Yeah, I'm sorry, Pr- Mira, I work alone. - So you're gonna stop Zurg all by yourself? - That's the general plan. Regulations clearly state- I know regulations! I wrote half of them! As long as Zurg is gunnin' for me, anybody close to me is gonna get caught in the cross fire. Noted. But, Buzz, there's one thing you should know. - Yes, sir? - You are not going out there without backup! I'm sorry, Commander, but from now on, Buzz Lightyear flies solo. All personnel clear the launch bay. Star cruiser 36 prepare for launch. Crystallic fusion modules needed on pad 14. Hello! I'm just cleaning the floor and stuff. Clean is good. Rocket away. All personnel may return to the launch bay. Wow! An Andromeda-class star cruiser! Ambassador escort patrol is scheduled for launch at 0900. This is just too cool. You there! The launch bay is for authorized personnel only! I was just, um- Oh, man! just like I figured. Guess what, pal. You're through. He's not through till I say so. - Captain Lightyear. - Buzz! Ah, space dust. This place is filthy... and it goes right to the subatomic level. That's why this young man is in here with his molecular mop. - Carry on, custodian. - Oh, yes, sir. My mistake, sir. As you were, Corporal. Come on, Booster. This is the third time this week. You're really not authorized to be in here, son. Oh, I know, but I like to look at the star cruisers. I just want to be a Space Ranger so bad, Buzz. Now, don't you worry. You'll pass the entrance exam, Booster. - You've just got to study the- - Space Ranger mission manual? Oh, I am, sir! I memorize one page every night. I'm up to section five, subsection beta. " Light speed limits. More than just a good idea, it's the law. " - Outstanding. - Oh, thanks, Buzz. - Buzz Lightyear to Science Bay. - On my way. - Gotta run, Booster. - Yes, sir! - Uh, Booster? - Yes, sir? - At ease. - Thanks, Buzz. Good morning, lackeys! - Where's my new henchman? - They are arming him now, sir. Does he have a flamethrower? Remember last time. - A flamethrower would have really come in handy. - Tension feels about right. Ah, how are his reflexes? - Aaah! Not bad. - Thanks. A delightful blend of man and machine... with just a naughty touch of Lingonberry. I shall call you... Agent Z! That's stupid. - My mother used to call me that. - He really likes that name. Yes, he's been saving it for a very evil henchman. Agent Z, love it, especially the whole "Z" thing. And you know what? We'll save a fortune on monogramming. If I could just squeeze in here. Sir, your spy drone is in position. That's Jim-crackin'- Dandy! Come, Agent Z. Let us see if my spy drone can find this so-called Unimind. Ah! Ooh! The Unimind! Ahh! We are one. Ohh! I must have this mystical orb, this Unimind! Launch an immediate assault on the planet of the little green men. - Excellent. A chance to use this. - Ooh! The flamethrower. What's up, fellas? We heard about your fight with Commander Nebula. Now, it wasn't a fight. It was just a professional disagreement... and in time, he'll admit that I'm better off alone. We have solved your partner problem. Not you guys too. Look, I can't have a partner problem, because I don't have a partner. But X.R. is perfect for you. X.R.? Who's X.R.? Yes! Not who. What? Witness the future of space justice. - X.R.! - The experimental ranger. X.R. reporting for duty. Kind of short, isn't he? Hmm? Do ya think so? That little robot wouldn't stand a chance against Zurg's forces of evil. Watch! You're, uh, going somewhere with this? If Zurg blows up X.R.- We can put him back together. And Commander Nebula approved a robot ranger? He hates robots. Well, he doesn't exactly know. He does now! Hmph! Oh, hello, Commander. So you went ahead and built that expendable ranger. Experimental ranger. - Unauthorized ranger! - Uh- Ha, ha. Well, technically, it was authorized... by you. We slipped it in with our vacation request. Craters. They always get me that way. I keep tellin' them no bucket of bolts can stand up to a real ranger. He's got ya there, fellas. We thought of that. Artificial intelligence chip. X.R. is programmed to watch and learn. - And he'll be learnin' from the best. You. - True. But, uh, I don't know. I don't know. At least give him a test run as your new partner. Lightyear, I already told you! Ranger Nova is your new partner. Why won't anybody listen to me? No more partners! But, Buzz! - What's eating them? - I've seen this before. It's the mindlink. Evil! Zurg! - His dark forces invade our home world! - I'm on my way. I'm on my way. Buzz Lightyear mission log. Zurg's dark shadow looms over the- - Could you not do that? - Could you not do that? - The Unimind! - The Unimind! - The Unimind! - Quickly! We must get to the Unimind! - Get below! - The Unimind! The Unimind! - Protect the Unimind! - We are one. We are united. We are powerful! We are... afraid! Oh, no! Hornets, move in. At ease, little green citizens. Star Command is on the job. Yea! At ease, little green citizens. Star Command is on the job. Our work's not done yet, X.R.! Agent Z to Zurg. They sent Lightyear. That's why I sent you. Craters! A new player. We got 'im on the run. We've got him on the... run? He's good. But I'm better. X.R.! He's good, but I'm better. You are learning. Now, watch this. They never see this coming. Huh? Saw it coming. - X.R.! Gun! - X.R.! Gun! X.R.! System malfunction. Agent Z to Zurg. The Unimind is all yours. You're good, but I'm better. The Unimind! The Unimind! Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. This is a priority one mission update. The Unimind has been captured... and we've got a ranger down. You can fix him, right? - Can we? - I don't know. - We are not one. - But we shall try. Buzz Lightyear personal log. My brave little robotic partner had been blasted into a pile of trillium carbonic scrap. And yet, the L.G.M.s were rebuilding him. Even without the Unimind, those little green guys had the right stuff. Then came the wrong stuff. Their selection of auxiliary gear was obviously nonregulation. But perhaps there was a method to their madness. Maybe,just maybe. No. They had lost it. Wow. They really need that uni-ma-call-it. I don't think they have any idea what they're doing anymore, Commander. What is, uh, this thing? - Uh, an arm? - Told ya. Blast! Zurg knows the little green guys keep Star Command runnin'! That stinkin'bucket head. He did this to cripple our operation. No, Commander. If that's all Zurg wanted, he could have destroyed the Unimind. Instead, he had his new lackey, Agent Z, steal it. But why? What's he gonna do with it? I don't know exactly, but I believe that even now Zurg is hatching... his most diabolical scheme yet. This is my most diabolical scheme yet. Assuming that the freak show, known as my staff... can do one thing right! Of course, my evil Emperor, and, uh, uh, who better to give you the good news than, uh- Brain Pod Percy! Okay, hi, uh, Mr. Evil Emperor. How are you? You look terrif- very sinister today. We believe that just as the Unimind connected all the L.G.M.s... it could hopefully allow you to reach out... and ensnare every innocent mind in the Galactic Alliance. You know, a mind slave, evil puppet kind of scenario. You're telling me my plan. I already know my plan. I made up the plan. It's my plan. What I don't know is how close you are to accomplishing my plan! Yeah, kind of an outdoor voice there. Okay, naturally, the first step is to turn the Unimind from good to evil. But, um, we don't have any idea how- Lamebrain! If you want something turned evil... turn it evil yourself. That's what Nana Zurg always used to say to me... and she was plenty evil. Evil overload! Nana Zurg would be so proud. All rangers to mission briefing room. - All rangers to mission briefing room. - Something big going on? - Sorry. Can't talk. - Top secret. Oh, so, um, you guys need me to empty the wastebaskets or something? Sorry, Booster. This is Space Ranger business. Yeah, Space Ranger business. I don't know what Zurg's plannin' on doin' with the Unimind... but I plan on beatin' him to the punch. We're launching a full-scale assault on Planet Z. Whoa! Full-scale? Buzz, listen to your trusty partner when I say... maybe we've overlooked a little thing I like to call negotiation. - X.R.? - Follow me on this, Buzz. Two words. Time-share. How many of you love it? All right. Monday through Wednesday, admittedly, the galaxy belongs to Zurg. But Thursday through Saturday, it's ours. We alternate Sundays. What do you think? Sweet mother of Venus. What did you do to him? - We, uh, fixed him. - We, uh, think. Get that thing out of here! - What did I say? Come on. You know the time-share idea is solid, and you're jealous. Where are you guys goin' with the robot? Please. Experimental ranger. - We were looking for you, Booster. - Yeah. We thought you could use some help. Here. You'll love him. I am lovable. Delta Squadron will occupy Zurg's fleet... while Gamma Squadron attacks Planet Z itself. This is no cakewalk. It's a high-risk operation. Excuse me, Commander. Sorry to interrupt... but I've been studying Zurg's planetary defense matrix. I think a small, one-man ship- Could slip past the defenses unnoticed. Exactly. A single ranger could undermine Zurg's evil operation from within. And with the new Alpha One prototype, I could slip right- Wait a minute. It was my idea. I should go. Sorry, but you don't have the field experience to take on such a dicey assignment, Princess. Princess? I am a Space Ranger. You know what? You two really should be partners. 'Cause you're both pigheaded show-offs! - But, Commander- - Zip it. The Alpha One is still an experimental spacecraft. Nobody's taking it! We're doing this my way. Star Command will launch a full assault on Planet Z at 0800 hours. How long do we have to do this? The cafeteria's a high traffic area. This could take a while. Hey, here's an idea. We ditch work and do something fun. No way! I would never shirk my duty. Hmph. Buzz would be very disappointed. Buzz? As in Lightyear? As if there's any other Buzz. - You know, I used to be Buzz Lightyear's partner. - Get out! That's exactly what Command Nebula said. Now look at me. Hey, Booster. How would you like a V.I.P. tour of Buzz Lightyear's star cruiser? - That would be the coolest thing ever! - Whoa, slim! Whoa! I don't know about that, but it beats working. Follow me! Space Ranger Buzz Lightyear to Mission Control. Ready to launch to infinity... and- Oh, come on, X.R. Say it with me. What? Oh, yeah. - To infinity... - To infinity and... whatever. - and beyond! - Beyond, yeah, right. Soon my Zurgatronic megaray will be fully operational! Install the evil Unimind! Now, load the crystallic fusion cell. The Zurgatronic megaray will use the Unimind... to spread my evil... across the universe! - Oh, yeah! - You haven't won until Lightyear is out of the picture. - Fusion cell loaded! - Fire Zurgatronic megaray! - Firing Zurgerrific ray. - Zurgatronic, ya lack-wit! Hee, hee. Sorry. " Zurgerrific"'s not bad, though. Let's file it for future use. Did you make sure that the plus end went to the plus part... and the minus end went to the minus part? Oh! Oh! That would do it, huh? Oh! All L.G.M. maintenance checks... have been canceled until further notice. Rocket Crockett to mission ops immediately. - Going somewhere, Princess? - Buzz! Well, hi. How are ya? I was, uh, you know,just taking a little stroll, and I thought- Ranger Mira Nova, you were about to hijack the Alpha One, weren't you? Why, I- Yes, sir. Princess, report yourself to Commander Nebula at once. I'm sorry. I just wanted to help, you know? And I thought this would be the best way- Hey, wait a minute. What are you doing down here? Well, I-I am on a routine inspection of the canooter valves. And, uh, yep, yep, everything looks good up here. You were about to hijack the Alpha One. Oh, of all the nerve! Report yourself to Commander Nebula. Mira, now is neither the time nor the place. Buzz, I just have one thing to say to you. - And what might that be? - Good night. Tangean brain squeeze. Oh! Uh-oh. Who authorized that launch? That wasn't us, was it? I know who. It's the princess, Commander. She stole the Alpha One to take on Zurg by herself. She beat ya to it, huh? Yeah, yeah, pretty much. Well, Ranger Nova is your partner. Better go get her, son. Yes, sir. For the record, she is not my partner, sir. Whoosh! Whoosh! Look out for the asteroids, X.R. Yeah, whoosh, zoom. Whatever, Booster. Sorry. Ranger Lightyear. Buzz Lightyear to the rescue! Shh. Listen. Somebody's coming. Oh, no! We shouldn't be here. I'm gonna get fired... prosecuted, convicted! Ya gotta hide me! Hmm. Odd. Okay, husky Bob, let's go. - You are clear for emergency liftoff. - Roger that. Oh, come on! He didn't see us. See? Just stick with X.R. and everything is A-OK. Wait a minute. - Whoa! - Whoa! Zurgatronic megaray on-line, evil Emperor Zurg. You're sure this time, yes? Reasonably. Let's test it on something before we hit Star Command. We need a target that won't, um, shoot back. May I suggest Rizone, my evil Emperor? The Planet of the Vegetarians, yes! Delicious suggestion, uh, number, um, 29. How long have you been with my evil organization? Ooh, let's see, uh, in total or just since I've been a brain in a jar? - Brain in a jar. - Four years next week. Fascinating. Ha, ha. Okay, then- Now that you mention it. I am overdue for a cost-of-living raise. You know, when I gave up my body, certain promises were made. - I was being polite! I don't really care, all right? - All right. Unless anyone else wants to tell me his or her life story... can we shoot the big gun? Target acquired: Rizone. - Um, more salad? - Oh, I couldn't. Well, I'm off to meditate for galactic peace. Oh, isn't that lovely? I can feel it! I control every mind on the planet! It worked! Evil rules! Oh, this is fun! Let's hit something else. - Batheous? - The fish faces? - Test underwater effectiveness. - Good point. Target: Batheous. Another planet and it's mine! I'm not the man who knows the man! I am the man! About that raise, sir? Please! Once I enslave the universe, I won't need the likes of you. It'll be all Zurg all the time! 24-7! Zurgie heaven! Alpha One, power down your engines. Buzz, you know my plan can work. I can get past Zurg's defenses. Unfortunately, Mira, the commander doesn't agree with us. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Huh? Find anything? Bingo. Spare space suits. Slap one on ya,jet back to Star Command and no one's the wiser. Uh, X.R.? Slight problem. Oh, come on! End of the line, Princess. Ease off those thrusters, Mira. You'll just burn 'em out. Oh, craters! Ranger Nova, that was the most outrageous showboating stunt I've ever seen. Kind of reminds ya of yourself, huh? Yeah, kinda. This isn't going to work. Sure it will. Come on. Just suck it in. You can do it, big fella. Think thin. That's the key. Uh, hello? All is ready, my evil Emperor. Target Star Command and fire! And so ends Star Command. Ooh, I'm so evil! I just gave myself chills! Even my goose bumps have goose bumps! I'm a bad boy! Simple question: What are you doing here? Yeah, buddy. What are you doing here? We want answers, and we want them now. - I meant both of you. - How's that? It's a complicated explanation, Buzz. I think it's best we just sweep the whole incident under the rug. Since we're a couple of janitors... I can promise you that's no problem. I'm sorry, Buzz. Red alert! Hey, guys, wait up! - What was that? - It's headed toward Star Command. Well, the station looks okay. Buzz Lightyear to Star Command. Come in, Star Command. I don't like this. X.R., report. Sensors indicate "spooky. " In fact, I'm going to have to go with "very spooky. " Where is everyone? What happened? I mean, there's no sign of a struggle. Mmm. My scanner is picking up some- Lightyear! How good of you to join us. - Zurg? - In a manner of speaking. - Aaah! - Ohh, that's spooky. You see, I used the Unimind to link your fellow rangers... to my evil! And that's just the beginning. Soon, the entire Galactic Alliance... will be under my control. As a robot, I'm not susceptible to mind control, so this really isn't an issue for me. It'll be your issue when they rip you apart and sell you for scrap. Good point. Anybody got a plan? Here's one. - Back to the ship, people! - " People"? That does include me, right? - Aaah! - Uh-oh! No, Mira. Although possessed by the most powerful evil in the universe, they're still fellow rangers. Then how do we get past them? Looks like we got us a high traffic area. Whoa! All right, let's wax 'em, big guy. just push me- Not so fast, not so fast! Ya-hoo! To the launch bay! - Good work, people. - And robot? And robot. Lightyear must not escape! If Zurg has taken over every mind on Star Command... that means we're the only Space Rangers left. - What do we do? - We've got to take the battle to Zurg. No need. He's bringing it to us. Ohh! I got a lot of red lights blinking over here. I don't need those lights to tell me we're in trouble. I had no idea a star cruiser could pull a move like that. And neither did Zurg. I'll make a note of it. We're surrounded! The guy's an evil genius, and the best he can come up with is a ventriloquist act. What's next? Evil juggling? Farewell, Lightyear. - They're retreating. - But why? Obviously, my caustic tongue cut 'em to the quick. I'm getting a funny energy reading. Mira, check the hull. We've got a bomb! - A bomb? - Perfect. At last. For too long, Lightyear has hounded me. But no more. Buzz Lightyear mission log. By launching the Alpha One at the precise moment of detonation... Zurg believes us to be destroyed. I feel I must pause for a moment of silence in honor of my ship. Oh, please. It was just a hunk of metal. - Okay, and you are? - In serious need of some personal space. So, Buzz, did Zurg win? Not a chance, Booster. I've got Zurg right where I want him. Yeah? Well, wherever he is, I'll bet he's got legroom. As long as Zurg thinks I'm dead, he won't be looking for me... and that gives me the advantage. I never thought it would be so easy. What, the defeat of Star Command? I always knew it was doable. Not that. Lightyear. Ah, yes, my dearly departed foe. Somehow, evil won't be quite as much fun without Buzz Lightyear to kick around. Okay, Ranger Nova, let's test that little theory of yours. So, nobody's ever actually infiltrated Planet Z before? - Never. - Oh, man. Listen, a spacecraft this small won't be detected. I'm positive. You know, I'm pretty- I'm not a hundred percent positive. Blast! The seeker drones are on patrol. This just gets better and better. I can do this. I just need a little elbow room! Uh, Buzz, I think I sat on a button. What button? Let me see. " Emergency water landing. " Oh, that wouldn't be so bad... if we were over water! What's gonna happen? First, the crystallic fusion core deactivates, and then- Oh, man! Blast! Rangers, condition status. - Not good. - Excellent. Let's roll. What now? That? That's not a spacecraft. It's obviously a weather balloon. Let's leave the brain work to those with the brains, shall we? Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. The Alpha One is A-OK. But it asks that we not do that again. You three take the ship, find the planets that Zurg hasn't hit yet... and supervise immediate evacuations. - What about Zurg? - He's my problem. He's everybody's problem. Mira, there's only one way for me to finish this mission- alone. But, Buzz, that's against the rules. In the Star Command Mission Manual it clearly states... that no ranger is to go into action without backup. I think it's section six, subsection delta. Actually, it's section six, subsection gamma. He's right. Subsection delta's the dress code. Incidentally, why can't we have nose rings? Because nose rings are for punks, little mister. If you can take on Zurg alone, I don't see why X.R. can't get a nose ring. I was just asking a question. I'm not getting a nose ring. Then who's getting a nose ring? That's why Buzz wants to ditch us! I am not getting a nose ring. Nobody's getting a nose ring! It's against the rules! Which, apparently, don't apply to you. Of course they apply to me. The rules apply to everyone. Great. Then you're not facing Zurg alone, and we'll be your backup. I want the three of you off this planet now, and that's an order. - Yes, sir! - Yes, sir! - Ranger Nova. - Yes, sir. Thank you. Next target, and- Oh. Who haven't we perverted into a twisted reflection of my evil? A few planets in the Beta quadrant remain unperverted. Ah, bingo! - Hey! Mother of pearl! - Oh, my. - Lightyear. - Zurg. By the authority of Star Command... I hereby place you under arrest. Not bad, Lightyear. I should've seen that one coming. Like I was sayin', you're under arrest. Aw, come on, buddy. That's no way to treat... your partner. Warp? Ohh! Surprised? You're alive? Or am I dead? No, you're not dead. Not yet, anyway. - But how? - The exploding moon. Convincing, wasn't it? Yeah, Zurg's fireworks are really top-shelf. - But, Warp- - Ahh. Agent Z, please. - Of course! Amnesia! - No. - Evil clone. - No. - Android replica. - No! Okay, okay, it's so obvious. Zurg's mind-control ray. He got to you first. Actually, I went to him. Evil is just so much more profitable than good, and more fun. I don't believe it. The Warp Darkmatter I trained side-by-side with... would not work for the most evil force in the universe. Look, Lightyear, I've been on Zurg's payroll since the academy. Once I got the L.G.M.s to spill the secret of the Unimind... the Big Z brought me on full-time. My name's Darkmatter. Who's surprised here? 
Buzz Lightyear: One of Star Command's finest, the perfect spy. And I gave you a really nice eulogy. 
Zurg: " He was not only a great ranger, but a great friend. " What a hoot! If only you knew! I miss him very much. Oh, one more time! I miss him very much. Miss him now? 
Buzz Lightyear: Stop mocking me! Aaaah!
Zurg: I'll admit that in the past... you have been a most formidable foe... but since you lost your dear partner, you've been off your game. 
Buzz Lightyear: Buzz Lightyear may end today... but what I believe in will live on- hope, freedom and justice.
Zurg: Oh, that's rich! Oh, please, please tell me you got that. - Got it! - Excellent! Add it to my collection. Besides, Mr. Melodrama... I'm not going to kill you. No. No, I have a much more delicious idea. I'm going to take the galaxy's greatest hero... and turn him... into me. Welcome to the team, partner. This isn't my team, and you're not my partner. Buzz Lightyear mission log, final entry. - What's he doing? - Mission log. He's a procedure nut. As if there's gonna be anyone left to read his report. Oooh! Sent packing like a bunch of first-year rookies. Which, technically, we are. I don't know if anyone will be left untainted by Zurg's evil... to receive this last chapter. - Did I sit on another button? - Shh. It's Buzz. - As I go to my doom... - Doom? I pause to pay tribute to three of the best and the brightest... to ever come out of Star Command. That's me and two others! I have taken a one-man stand against darkness and depravity... and I have failed. - I was wrong. - Keep rolling. This is priceless. Perhaps if I had taken a new partner... or two... or three... Hot rockets! Did you hear that? - He needs us! - He actually admits he needs us. We're comin', Buzz! Buzz Lightyear, over and out. Target Buzz Lightyear. Okeydoke. You're the evil emperor. Megaray mega-ready! Do it. Hot rockets! See, this is where metal arms come in handy. I don't wanna show off, but when you have to hold a heavy guy like- Aaah! Darkmatter, kill Lightyear! Where- Have you blown a circuit? Aaah! Aww! Stung by your own hornet, huh? Booster! - Ohh! - Sorry! Target the Planet of Widows and Orphans! You fiend! - There he is! I knew that would get him. - Haaah! - Haaah! Hey! Your puny Star Command laser is pathetic! Let me show you a real weapon! Oh, nice shot. The key is to not pull the trigger, but squeeze it. - N-N-No driving! - Get off!. Look out! - Buzz is hit. - Rookies. Hey, isn't that Buzz's dead partner? - Eject! - Whoa! - Aren't you the janitor? - Yep. Oh, this is gonna be great for my rep. Mira, Booster, X.R., can anybody read me? Do you copy? I can't make it in time. It's up to you now. Good luck. Give it up, Lightyear. I win. Evil never wins. Huh? Afraid of the dark, Zurg? Not today, Zurg. Evil Emperor Zurg, by the authority of Star Command- Section five, subsection zeta. That's the one about the evil emperor. You are under arrest! Like I said, evil never wins. F- Firing. Hey. You failed, Lightyear! With that final blast I have enslaved every free world in the Galactic Alliance! Wherever you go in the universe... you will hear my voice mocking you! Evil rules! Ha-ha-ha- Oh! We're not done yet. Booster, X.R., get up top and take Warp into custody. Mira,you're with me. Chain reaction! She's gonna blow! Get back here! Hey, release me! Hey! I'm Zurg's number-one agent! Now, there's something I wouldn't go boasting about. What, you're gonna jump? Are you crazy? Buddy boy, we're on the janitorial staff. You're looking at a couple of risk takers. - It's true. - No! Don't be such a fraidy-cat. Like we'd really just jump. Mm-kay, Buzz, what are we going to actually do? The L.G.M. mindlink was activated by a simple touch. Maybe,just maybe- You're doing it! The power of good is a strong thing, Mira. - Aah! - But not strong enough. Blast! Thanks to Zurg, the Unimind is rotten to the core. Then let's get you to the core. You're gonna ghost me? Aah! Aaah! Buzz! To infinity and beyond! Ah! Lightyear! No! My plan! My galaxy! Unimind wave impact in three seconds. Curse you, Buzz Lightyear! I'm going in! She's a goner! - Hey! - Thanks for the lift, Mira. Eh, anytime, sir. I hope the Unimind still works for you guys. We are one. Our mindlink has been restored. All is as it was. To infinity and beyond! I can't believe we captured Agent Z. I can't believe he turned out to be Buzz's dead partner who wasn't really dead. Yeah, that too. Uh-huh. Amazing! Easy, fellas. I know I've exceeded all performance expectations. It's not that, X.R. You're almost human. So many character flaws! Okay. You know what? Let's just say "amazing" and leave it at that! Well, Lightyear,you managed to save the universe again. It wasn't just me, sir. Zurg almost won. In fact, he would have, except I had backup. Well, of course you had backup. 'Cause everybody needs backup. It's in the manual. Section six, subsection gamma. Got the message, guys. So, who's your partner gonna be, son? Don't worry, Commander. I've made my choice. Team Lightyear reporting for duty, sir! So cool! To infinity... and beyond!
