- I found
<br/>
<br/>
- Dreamed of, dreamed of
<br/>
<br/>
- But I couldn't think
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the long way out
<br/>
- It's gonna be
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and we're still happy
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the long way out
<br/>
- It's gonna be
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, yeah
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It all began at the Plaza Hotel...
<br/>
twenty years ago
in the month of june.
<br/>
Two mothers brought their
daughters, Liv and Emma...
<br/>
here to the Palm Court for tea.
<br/>
On that afternoon,
there was a wedding.
<br/>
There was something blue,
something borrowed...
<br/>
and something completely magical.
<br/>
And two little girls
from New Jersey...
<br/>
held in their hands a new dream-
<br/>
that one day they would find
that one person...
<br/>
who would stand by them
no matter what...
<br/>
and when they did, they too...
<br/>
would have june
weddings at the Plaza.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
And, yes, Your Honor, I will take
this lofty man to be my husband.
<br/>
I always knew my wedding
would be the happiest day of my life.
<br/>
Now I will dance with you
until we have six babies and a house.
<br/>
Do you think they let pets
inside the Plaza?
<br/>
Well, it's not like we're getting
married until we're 16 at least.
<br/>
Next time, can I play the bride?
<br/>
Emma, you know
I always play the bride.
<br/>
an everlasting love
<br/>
- Not too shabby.
<br/>
Caviar cocktail hour...
- Cigar roller, white glove service...
<br/>
Celadon cymbidium orchids.
- Great deejay.
<br/>
So we both admit it's beautiful.
<br/>
Um, yeah.
- But?
<br/>
Do you think it's the
work of Marion St. Claire?
<br/>
Oh. Marion's a visionary.
<br/>
Mmm?
<br/>
Oh. - If it had
been my wedding...
<br/>
Oh, just say it.
- It ain't june.
<br/>
And it ain't the Plaza.
- It's the elephant in the room.
<br/>
Yeah.
<br/>
And here you are.
- Oh, look.
<br/>
A duck made out of ice.
Isn't this great?
<br/>
Know what else is great?
<br/>
Going home early and
watching your backed-up Ti-Vo?
<br/>
Am I that predictable?
<br/>
How about one more dance...
<br/>
and I'll give you my piece
of the cake, if you let me lead.
<br/>
Very funny.
<br/>
Come on. Come on.
- You know I always lead.
<br/>
Hey. Oh.
<br/>
Hi, girls.
<br/>
Are you ready to catch
this bouquet? - Gotta go.
<br/>
I'm so happy all of you are here.
- On the other hand, always fun.
<br/>
I know. They take it so seriously.
<br/>
My work friends, sort of.
<br/>
My college buds.
- Oh, my God.
<br/>
Emma Allan, is that the same
dress you wore to the Delta Gamma...
<br/>
"Kegs for a Cause" semiformal,
like, a bazillion years ago?
<br/>
Yeah.
- What's your point? Because it's a classic.
<br/>
If a dress works, you work it hard.
- Oh.
<br/>
See, that is sweet. And loyal.
<br/>
Girlfriends sticking up
for each other.
<br/>
I like that, a lot. Keep that.
<br/>
Anyway, are you guys
ready to catch this? - Yeah.
<br/>
Just think about it,
feel it, catch it-
<br/>
One, two, three!
<br/>
I would have seen
the signs if I'd been there.
<br/>
It's all right there.
Look at Emma's eyes. Like a hunter's.
<br/>
And Liv's hand-How would you
ike that clasped around your throat?
<br/>
Not that either of them can
imagine hurting each other at this point.
<br/>
Why should they?
They've been inseparable for 20 years.
<br/>
Okay, slow down.
<br/>
Why can't we run with iPods?
- We can't run with iPods because iPods...
<br/>
are for people who can't be
alone with their own thoughts.
<br/>
I'm literally running circles
around you. Do you know that?
<br/>
Do you know how many
things I can think about at once?
<br/>
You know what
a multitasker I am.
<br/>
You're not enjoying my
conversation? Is that what you're saying?
<br/>
I'm hurt. I am
very hurt, Liv. - I gotta go.
<br/>
All right. Have a good day.
- Love you.
<br/>
Call me. Tell me how the meeting goes.
- Watch this power walk.
<br/>
Whoo!
- Whoo!
<br/>
Hey, did you get
the changes to the brief?
<br/>
Read and highlighted
in the cab. - Great.
<br/>
Purse. It's like the
whole city is made out of lint.
<br/>
It's an aggressive approach, exploiting
the weaknesses of our plaintiffs case...
<br/>
and I think judicially
we'll find favor-
<br/>
Particularly if we pulljustice Givens.
<br/>
Thank you, Liv.
<br/>
Our best associate, Mr. Simmons.
<br/>
Maybe your approach
is too aggressive.
<br/>
I mean, if we pound them...
<br/>
as you suggest, they'll
hardly be in the mood to settle.
<br/>
Mr. Simmons, you don't-
You don't know me, but I-
<br/>
I know you.
<br/>
All you need to know
is how badly you want to win...
<br/>
because we won't be settling.
<br/>
You're right. She's perfect.
<br/>
Oh, Mrs. Allan?
- Hey, Robert. What's up?
<br/>
I think Mrs. Delgado
is looking for you.
<br/>
Is she? W... was she nearby?
<br/>
She... she's in her room.
- She's...
<br/>
Emma, there you are.
<br/>
Oh, God, Deb. Hi.
- I know. Isn't it gorgeous?
<br/>
God, I feel so
blessed to have this body.
<br/>
You know, I am so late... - No, no, no.
Listen. You gotta help me out here.
<br/>
You know the debate team?
- Yeah.
<br/>
I cannot go to the state finals.
<br/>
I mean, children talking
about their little problems.
<br/>
Ugh! You gotta do it for me.
<br/>
Yeah, Deb, I'm already
doing your late bus patrol...
<br/>
and pep squad and your
after-school detention.
<br/>
You're the debate team adviser. I
don't think that I should... - I know.
<br/>
I do so much.
<br/>
I wish I could just
do the bare minimum.
<br/>
I so admire you for that.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Anyway, all right, look.
Here's how we'll work it out.
<br/>
I'll do the debate team...
- Okay, good.
<br/>
Uh-huh. If you take my Tuesday
study halls for the rest of the year.
<br/>
Okay?
- Yeah, that's... - No.
<br/>
All right. You owe me, girl.
<br/>
Get out of the hallway, kids!
- You know why she does this?
<br/>
You're the best teacher
at that school. - No, I...
<br/>
She's trying to overwork you,
so you crack under pressure.
<br/>
Mm-mmm.
- Middle school's a jungle.
<br/>
I don't know.
I think she's kind of sad.
<br/>
I mean, she's been
divorced, like, three times.
<br/>
She's way ahead of us.
I mean, where are our divorces?
<br/>
I gotta get married first.
<br/>
God, I hate Daniel!
<br/>
No, Kevin. I'm
dealing with a crisis.
<br/>
What's your crisis?
<br/>
Uh, that's code for
"I don't want to talk to you."
<br/>
Oh, I see. Well, then thank
you for putting me through.
<br/>
See? I told you those jeans would
look great on you. - They aren't too tight?
<br/>
No, no. Not at all.
But this...
<br/>
I mean, Emma, yellow...
Not your color.
<br/>
Okay? Seriously.
Oh, but you know what? Try this.
<br/>
Because, you
know what? Keep it.
<br/>
Well... - It never
hung right on me anyway.
<br/>
Of course it doesn't
hang right on you.
<br/>
It's... my size, and it's new.
<br/>
This is the Dolce blouse
I told you about last week.
<br/>
Liv, I can't.
- Hey, hey. It was on sale.
<br/>
I practically made money on it.
- Liv, it's too much.
<br/>
Emma, Emma. Emma,
Just say thank you. just...
<br/>
Thank you. It's beautiful.
I love it. - Good.
<br/>
Now this, Emma's stuff. Emma's stuff.
Let's get rid of it at one point.
<br/>
You moved out, like,
a hundred years ago. Okay.
<br/>
Daniel's sweater? Cardigan?
You wanna try that? - Yeah, love it.
<br/>
Oh-
<br/>
Tiffany box.
<br/>
You're getting engaged?
- I'm getting engaged.
<br/>
I'm getting engaged!
- You're getting engaged!
<br/>
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!
<br/>
Emma.
- No! Stop it. No. Liv!
<br/>
I have to look.
- Stop it! No! No!
<br/>
No, no!
<br/>
You can't stop me.
<br/>
I'm sorry.
<br/>
But he should see your face
when you first see the ring.
<br/>
Good call.
<br/>
You always think of others, Emma.
<br/>
It never occurs to me like that.
<br/>
I mean, sometimes it does.
<br/>
I'm really happy for you.
<br/>
Promise me you won't tell
anyone until after he proposes.
<br/>
Oh, God. I would never.
I'd be out of my mind.
<br/>
I'm engaged!
<br/>
Can we get four
tequila shots? - No. No.
<br/>
No, no, no. None for me.
<br/>
Oh, right.
- I'm fine.
<br/>
Acapulco, 2006,
Emma and Fletcher on a break.
<br/>
"Never talk about
that weekend again."
<br/>
"I'm so lonely and confused,
and very thirsty. Please, Miguel"-
<br/>
Okay, okay, okay.
Make it stop. Please.
<br/>
All right, a toast.
<br/>
To Liv. Congratulations
to an amazing friend.
<br/>
And condolences to
Emma, Liv's maid of honor.
<br/>
She will surely be
the most nightmarish bride ever.
<br/>
It is my burden and mine alone.
<br/>
I'll be repaying the favor
very soon. Cheers. - Drink up.
<br/>
What did I rush down here for?
- Nate! I'm getting married.
<br/>
Get out.
- Yeah.
<br/>
Oh, my God. Sister's gettin' married here.
<br/>
Where's... where's the groom?
- Oh. Oh. He's not here.
<br/>
Well, he hasn't actually
popped the question yet.
<br/>
A toast. To Daniel...
<br/>
who in his own world
is just working late...
<br/>
but I guess in Liv's
world has just proposed.
<br/>
So God bless him for wanting...
<br/>
to spend his life
with my sister in any world.
<br/>
To Liv.
- We love ya.
<br/>
He's a lucky guy.
- Yep. The biggest day of a girl's life.
<br/>
I'm gonna be right back.
<br/>
Damn. Should I?
- I got it.
<br/>
I mean, they didn't get
to see me graduate law school...
<br/>
or read Nate's first story
in New York magazine.
<br/>
So I can't share this with 'em.
<br/>
I wish your parents
could be here too.
<br/>
Whatever. It's fine. I'm fine.
<br/>
Liv, you're only human.
<br/>
You don't have to have it
together every minute of every day.
<br/>
Former chubby girls.
We're made of steel.
<br/>
And Splenda. We survive.
<br/>
Well, first of all, you weren't fat.
<br/>
But, yes, you do survive.
<br/>
Thanks, Em.
- You're welcome, Liv.
<br/>
You're gonna be
the best maid of honor.
<br/>
Yes, I am.
- What do we do first?
<br/>
First- Oh! I was thinking.
<br/>
It might be a good idea
to actually get the proposal.
<br/>
See? It's that head for details.
<br/>
Yeah, right? I know.
<br/>
...people watching
this performance at home...
<br/>
with a huge question mark.
<br/>
Hey, babe? I don't think
they sent us any fortune cookies.
<br/>
No, they sent 'em.
I got them right here.
<br/>
Oh, good.
<br/>
Okay. Here we are.
<br/>
I'm just cuing it up.
- Mm-hmm.
<br/>
This guy's gotta go. I'm sorry.
I know you like him. - Mm-hmm.
<br/>
He's very pitchy. - You know,
Fletch, that is actually a real thing.
<br/>
Pitchy. It's not just code
for someone you don't like.
<br/>
Oh, okay. You're pitchy.
<br/>
Oh, uh, that one's mine.
<br/>
Please. - You're really
calling dibs on fortune cookies now?
<br/>
Yeah. It's on the right side.
- Okay, it's fine.
<br/>
Yours is the left. - If your
fortune's better than mine, I'm claiming it.
<br/>
I don't think it will be.
- Okay. Are you ready?
<br/>
One-
- Two.
<br/>
Three.
<br/>
What's this?
<br/>
I put a lot of thought
into where I was gonna do this...
<br/>
and, uh, I wanna do it here.
<br/>
This is our home...
<br/>
and if I'm 99 years old and
we're doing exactly this in our home,
<br/>
TV and gettin' Chinese food...
<br/>
that'll be good enough for me.
<br/>
So, Emma Allan?
<br/>
Uh-huh?
- Will you marry me?
<br/>
Yes. Yes.
<br/>
It didn't happen tonight.
<br/>
But I'm not worried, 'cause
I'm sure Daniel's... - I... I'm engaged.
<br/>
Fletcher just proposed,
like, two minutes ago.
<br/>
I'm engaged.
<br/>
Color?
- Colorless.
<br/>
Cut?
- Brilliant.
<br/>
Clarity?
- Slightly included.
<br/>
Carat? - Almost,
maybe just under.
<br/>
More than he could afford, I'm sure.
<br/>
Ohhh.
<br/>
Engaged? Wow!
<br/>
Liv's engaged. You're engaged.
<br/>
That's... that's...
<br/>
C... can I call you back?
<br/>
What do you mean
Emma's engaged?
<br/>
No. Of course I'm happy.
Why wouldn't I be happy?
<br/>
I think it's great. Yeah.
<br/>
No, you don't have to come here.
I'm fine. I'm not gonna eat anything. Okay.
<br/>
And I have the perfect
wedding present.
<br/>
You are going to live
with Emma and Fletcher.
<br/>
You're irritating me.
<br/>
I can't believe it.
<br/>
It's so weird having this on
my finger. I mean, hey, look.
<br/>
It even sparkles in the rain.
- Blinding. Ouch.
<br/>
So I'm thinking about getting
Dj Humble to spin at my party.
<br/>
I don't know though.
Is that weird? - You should go for it.
<br/>
I'm not really a big band kind of girl.
- Whatever.
<br/>
It's your wedding.
- Oh. My mom can't fly up until the wedding.
<br/>
She's too busy with work.
But who cares. I've got you, right?
<br/>
Yeah. I'm so psyched.
- So would you come with me to meet her?
<br/>
I'm sorry. What? Meet who?
- Marion St. Claire.
<br/>
Haven't you been listening?
I've got an appointment with her on Friday.
<br/>
You already made
an appointment? - Yeah.
<br/>
You just got engaged last night.
- I know.
<br/>
But technically, I'm already behind.
<br/>
You gotta book early
if you want the Plaza.
<br/>
The Plaza? I can't believe this.
<br/>
What-What's the matter?
Why are you mad?
<br/>
I'm not mad. No, not at you.
<br/>
I just don't know
what's taking Daniel so long.
<br/>
Oh, God. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have...
<br/>
We don't have to talk
about this. Let's just drop it.
<br/>
Don't worry about me.
Worry about Daniel.
<br/>
He's gonna be dead soon.
- Why? What-
<br/>
Call you later.
- What are you go...
<br/>
Liv, you let him
do this his own way.
<br/>
Excuse me. Excuse me.
<br/>
Excuse me!
<br/>
Honey!
<br/>
Will you just
marry me, already?
<br/>
Yeah. Okay.
<br/>
Isn't that what you want?
'Cause it's what I want...
<br/>
and I just wanna know
if you want to marry me.
<br/>
Don't you wanna get married?
- Honey, can we talk about this later?
<br/>
Oh, you changed your mind?
I saw the Tiffany box in the closet.
<br/>
Right?
<br/>
Uh...
- Oh, my God.
<br/>
It's not a ring?
<br/>
If it's a key chain
I'm gonna kill myself...
<br/>
and I'm taking you
down with me. - Oh.
<br/>
Could you just tell me
right here and right now?
<br/>
Is it something
that you would want?
<br/>
Would you want...
would you want to get married?
<br/>
You know what I will tell you?
<br/>
I have never
met a more obnoxious...
<br/>
complicated, overbearing...
<br/>
gorgeous, smart,
sexy woman in my life.
<br/>
And...
<br/>
if you had just
waited until tonight...
<br/>
then you wouldn't be
the woman I fell in love with...
<br/>
because she doesn't
know how to wait.
<br/>
Will you hold that for a second?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Which is fine, as long as I get
to spend the rest of my life...
<br/>
trying to catch up with her.
<br/>
Liv?
- Hmm?
<br/>
Will you marry me?
<br/>
Are you proposing?
- Mmm.
<br/>
Really? Honey, it's
so out of nowhere.
<br/>
Liv, shut up.
Yes or no? - Yes. Yes.
<br/>
Babe.
- Yes.
<br/>
This is not how I planned it.
- Are you kidding?
<br/>
Oh!
<br/>
I love "Bring Your Hot
Girlfriend to Work" day. - Totally.
<br/>
And that is the
journey that brought...
<br/>
these two young brides to
my townhouse on that particular afternoon.
<br/>
No, no, no. Don't do that.
Not now. Not now. Let's go.
<br/>
Okay. I'm good.
<br/>
I'm Marion St. Claire...
<br/>
the most sought-after
wedding planner in Manhattan.
<br/>
Hi. We're Marion's 1.00.
- Mm-hmm.
<br/>
We're both getting married,
and we're both each other's maid of honor.
<br/>
No way. That's incredible.
<br/>
Ms. St. Claire will see you now.
<br/>
Hi. I'm Liv Lerner.
- Hi, Mrs. St. Claire. Wow.
<br/>
This is Emma Allan.
- What an honor.
<br/>
We've been best friends
for a long time. - I can't believe this.
<br/>
Sit.
<br/>
Okay.
- Got it.
<br/>
A wedding marks the first day...
<br/>
of the rest of your life.
<br/>
You have been dead until now.
<br/>
W... were you aware of that?
<br/>
You're dead right now.
<br/>
I understand.
- Thank you.
<br/>
Angela, for example, will die dead.
<br/>
Now I've read the brief
that she put together on you
<br/>
june weddings at the Plaza.
<br/>
So it's not even
a remote possibility?
<br/>
If you'd gone
elsewhere, not a chance.
<br/>
But you've come to me.
<br/>
Call me dream catcher. I'll answer.
<br/>
Ooh. Dream catcher.
<br/>
I happen to have...
<br/>
three openings
at the Rlaza in june.
<br/>
Two the first Saturday...
<br/>
and one the last Saturday.
<br/>
That would be
the 6th and the 27th.
<br/>
Oh! My parents' anniversary
is the 6th. That's so meant to be.
<br/>
Oh, my gosh!
- Yeah.
<br/>
Well, then I'll take the 27 th.
- Great.
<br/>
Um, you'll wanna discuss
this with your grooms.
<br/>
No.
- All right then.
<br/>
Just sign and...
<br/>
date these.
<br/>
Okay. - This feels pretty
good right now, I gotta say.
<br/>
Now, uh, we
should discuss themes.
<br/>
Uh, elegant minimalism...
- Classic traditionalism-
<br/>
with romantic textures.
- and trendy infusion.
<br/>
I'm impressed.
- Really?
<br/>
Well, we love you so much.
- She means... she means "Thank you."
<br/>
Your 1.15 is here, Mrs. St. Claire.
<br/>
Thank you... so much.
<br/>
I have packets
for you up front.
<br/>
Bride to bride, there's only
onejune opening left at the Plaza.
<br/>
Oh, my God. Thank you.
You are so sweet.
<br/>
Ms. St. Claire, first off,
I'm obsessed with you.
<br/>
Uh, it's an honor
and a privilege. - Sit.
<br/>
Sure.
<br/>
June. At the Plaza.
<br/>
Look at them.
So blissfully unaware...
<br/>
of the implications
of their wedding date.
<br/>
You see, at this point, june was
a mere three and a half months away...
<br/>
a blink of an eye, in wedding time.
<br/>
got my life, got my love
<br/>
Got the sunshine above
<br/>
this hard on myself
<br/>
beautiful reasons I have to be
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
<br/>
Miss Wang-
<br/>
Ohh.
- Lace bodice.
<br/>
Basque waist, 10-layer tulle...
<br/>
you should try it on.
<br/>
No. No, no. I'm
wearing my mom's dress.
<br/>
Emma, are you sure?
<br/>
Your mom's dress is beautiful,
but is... is it your dream or hers?
<br/>
It's mine. It's mine.
I wanna surprise her.
<br/>
But it is your day.
<br/>
Can't you just send her a big box
of chocolates on Mother's Day...
<br/>
and get the dress you want?
- It's really pretty.
<br/>
And I do love strapless.
- Me too.
<br/>
I feel like I'm cheating
on my mom's dress.
<br/>
I can't. I can't. I've very
comfortable with my decision.
<br/>
I'm just gonna put it back.
Put it back. - Okay.
<br/>
But I mean, if you like it...
<br/>
you should try it on.
- No. You saw it first.
<br/>
Please.
- That's a terrible reason. We're gonna try this on, okay?
<br/>
No, uh, I'm gonna... try it on.
<br/>
It's stunning. It's perfect.
<br/>
I know. Right?
- Mm-hmm.
<br/>
I should probably keep looking.
<br/>
Do you think there is
something better than Vera Wang?
<br/>
I'm sorry. Do they keep that next to
the something that is better than chocolate?
<br/>
Liv, get the dress.
- What if you change your mind?
<br/>
Just be very careful about
any pre-wedding weight gain.
<br/>
You don't alter a Vera to fit you;
you alter yourself to fit Vera.
<br/>
Weight gain. Please.
Yeah. Right. Me lose control?
<br/>
You see these eyes?
You know what that is?
<br/>
Focus. That's right.
<br/>
Well, it's contacts, and focus.
<br/>
You know, I'll take it.
- Perfect.
<br/>
I'll get you more champagne.
<br/>
Marion.
<br/>
A terrible mistake has been made...
<br/>
one I assure you
has never happened before...
<br/>
in the House of St. Claire.
<br/>
Your weddings have been
booked on the same day.
<br/>
Can you say that again?
I'm sorry. What?
<br/>
Your weddings have
been scheduled for the same date.
<br/>
Mother "F."
- Are you insane?
<br/>
The Plaza is our lifelong dream.
<br/>
Angela... mixed up the dates.
<br/>
You are now both set
to be married june 6...
<br/>
and the other bride on june 27.
<br/>
The next available date
at the Rlaza is june 15-
<br/>
Perfect. I'll take it.
- Three years from now.
<br/>
This is no-
- No, I can't-
<br/>
It's no problem.
Hold on. It's no problem.
<br/>
Because I'll negotiate it.
I negotiate for a living.
<br/>
I'll get the other bride to
switch her dates with you. - Trust me.
<br/>
You can't say
no to that face.
<br/>
Yes, well, our
confidentiality agreement...
<br/>
means that I
cannot tell you who she is...
<br/>
so which one of you
will choose a different venue?
<br/>
I'm leaving right
now, Mrs. St. Claire.
<br/>
Word to the wise, dear,
and also to you,
<br/>
do not use
me as a reference.
<br/>
Hello, Angela.
- Just...
<br/>
tell us where
the other bride is...
<br/>
and nobody's gonna get hurt.
<br/>
Hi.
- Hello, Stacy.
<br/>
How are you?
- It's Emma and Liv.
<br/>
You look gorgeous.
- Did you lose weight?
<br/>
You want me to change
the date of my wedding?
<br/>
Yeah.
- That'd be great.
<br/>
No. - You take the
6th, give me the 27 th-
<br/>
She can be
your wedding buddy.
<br/>
I'm a ball. Really. I am.
- Don't touch me.
<br/>
Let's talk numbers.
<br/>
Every wedding has a
price, hon. What's yours?
<br/>
You can't buy me.
So again, no.
<br/>
No, no, no. A thousand times, no.
<br/>
Good luck, ladies.
<br/>
There's something wrong with you.
<br/>
You're not leaving
until you change your-
<br/>
She's crazy!
<br/>
Just change your date.
- She's crazy! Somebody call security.
<br/>
You won't even change
your date! - You're crazy!
<br/>
It's unnecessary for you to touch me so hard.
- Technically, she pushed me too.
<br/>
Come on. Have
a nice day. - Whatever.
<br/>
We could sue. We could sue.
You're a lawyer. We could sue 'em all.
<br/>
We could sue the Plaza. We could
sue Marion. We could sue Angela...
<br/>
What's the point?
None of them are gonna make it right.
<br/>
No. It's up to us.
I want you at my wedding.
<br/>
And whichever
way this works out...
<br/>
one of us will just have
to be married on a different day.
<br/>
Absolutely. I mean, you know,
I want you at my wedding.
<br/>
Obviously. If we can't
think of any other way out of this...
<br/>
one of us will simply
have to be flexible.
<br/>
Yeah. One of us will just
have to change venues.
<br/>
Right. One of us could.
<br/>
Rrobably, um, not...
<br/>
the one of us who's been
saving up for a decade...
<br/>
because she makes a pittance
compared to the other one of us, but-
<br/>
True. I mean, or it would be...
<br/>
if the other one of us wasn't
so desperate to get married at the Plaza...
<br/>
because the Plaza, practically, is the only
happy memory she has of her childhood.
<br/>
So, oops. That's-
- Right.
<br/>
One of us will have
to move her date. - Yep.
<br/>
One of us will.
<br/>
And until one of us decides,
we shouldn't make any concrete plans.
<br/>
Agreed. There's some
time before we lock things in.
<br/>
Let's just not do anything...
- Right.
<br/>
until one of us
moves her date. - Okay.
<br/>
So, um...
<br/>
Talk to you soon.
One of us should
<br/>
call the other one.
<br/>
One of us hasn't called
me yet, but you know what?
<br/>
She's gonna move her date.
<br/>
She always was the bendy
one, even as a kid, remember?
<br/>
Yeah, she didn't sound
too bendy to me.
<br/>
I called Fletch,
and she picked up.
<br/>
He's doin'my
taxes tomorrow night.
<br/>
You can't get all
buddy-buddy with him. Not now.
<br/>
Anyway, Daniel can do
your taxes. He's "financey."
<br/>
It's a hedge fund, babe.
We don't do a lot of tax prep.
<br/>
Whatever. You do our taxes.
- Fletch has been my accountant for six years. I'm going.
<br/>
You're being ridiculous.
Just have a double wedding.
<br/>
What are we,
41-year-old twin sisters?
<br/>
Babe! Double wedding.
<br/>
A double wedding.
I think that's a great idea.
<br/>
It would be a hell of a party.
- You know, uh, no.
<br/>
I've shared everything
my whole life with Liv.
<br/>
I'd kinda like my
own day just... just once.
<br/>
I know, bug. Is this everything?
This is all your gas receipts-
<br/>
Threw it all in the shoe box.
I don't know.
<br/>
It's my dream to...
to get married at the Plaza.
<br/>
I have been
saving since I was 16.
<br/>
I just need a few
more days to... let it go.
<br/>
I'll find a new dream.
Liv's reasons are better than mine.
<br/>
It's like American idol, all right?
<br/>
Liv is the Simon. Ugh. God.
<br/>
I mean, no offense.
But you're the Paula.
<br/>
Even when they can't sing,
you compliment their outfit.
<br/>
It's nice.
- Well, but everyone listens to Simon.
<br/>
I wouldn't marry Simon.
I'd marry me some Paula.
<br/>
Mmm.
<br/>
That's nice. - Just pick one.
I'm fine with any of'em.
<br/>
See? That's why I need a
maid of honor. You don't care.
<br/>
I... hey, you wanna
have her back in the game?
<br/>
You know what you're gonna
have to do, and the sooner the better.
<br/>
We need to give our
guests some notice. - Exactly.
<br/>
Which is why save-the-dates
are so key, but you don't care.
<br/>
It's not that I don't care.
- Well, get your phone then.
<br/>
Hello?
- Men.
<br/>
Yo, Fletch. No, nothin' much.
Just lookin' at save-the-dates or invites.
<br/>
Are we still on for tomorrow?
- Yeah, totally.
<br/>
Any sign of progress on
your end? Is Liv softening at all?
<br/>
No way. And there's no
way she's gonna blink first.
<br/>
They haven't spoken for a week.
<br/>
That's a century in girl years.
<br/>
What is it about weddings
that makes 'em so worked up?
<br/>
I know. I have no idea.
<br/>
It's, like, the wrong time to let
the guy know that you're crazy.
<br/>
You know what I mean?
It's not how I'd play it. - Yeah.
<br/>
Oh, you know what?
She's here now.
<br/>
I'll see you tomorrow?
- All right.
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
Hi, sweetie.
- Hi.
<br/>
How was pep squad?
- I hate pep squad.
<br/>
I particularly hate
peppy teenage girls...
<br/>
who insist everyone be
aggressive... B - E aggressive.
<br/>
It's, like, there are other pathways
in life besides aggression, you know?
<br/>
I'm gonna call Liv.
<br/>
Really?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Amie and Marissa are
throwing us that joint shower...
<br/>
and it'd be good to have
all this behind us by then. Right?
<br/>
You sure?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Yeah. I agree. I was just
talkin' to Daniel. She's on her cell.
<br/>
You should call her. They're out
doin' their save-the-dates or whatever.
<br/>
What?
- You should hit her up.
<br/>
You have to
know your "date" date...
<br/>
to send out
your save-the-dates.
<br/>
Oh.
<br/>
We were both
gonna wait, and she... she...
<br/>
I ca... I can't believe it.
<br/>
You can't believe this?
Really? It's Liv.
<br/>
She's always thinking
about number one. - No.
<br/>
Not this time. No.
No, no, no, no, no.
<br/>
I am a bride too. Okay?
<br/>
I'm number one too.
<br/>
I- You are my number one.
I know. That's how I feel.
<br/>
Bug, what are you doing?
<br/>
Subject...- Listen. Listen.
No, no, no, no, no.
<br/>
Emergency. This is not spam.
<br/>
I'm getting married, june 6-
- You don't have to slam on the keys.
<br/>
The Plaza Hotel. Be there.
X- O-X-O-X-O-X-O. Emma.
<br/>
Address book.
B.C.C. everyone.
<br/>
Oops. Not you, Liv.
<br/>
And send.
<br/>
"Emergen-C-C-C.
"Thys' is "nit' spam.
<br/>
I'm get married. june 6th."
<br/>
"K.j. A."? "Kuh-jaw"?
<br/>
"Emma."
<br/>
What is "kuh-jaw", Emma?
<br/>
Great. Emma's wedding's
gonna be better than ours was.
<br/>
Glen.
<br/>
Maybe her marriage
will be better too.
<br/>
Not filled with
loneliness and sadness.
<br/>
I hope you can appreciate
the positions Amie and I are in.
<br/>
We're not taking sides.
- Relax.
<br/>
We're not making any plans
until we figure this out. - Wow.
<br/>
You're so cool about it.
- Yeah.
<br/>
How else am I gonna be? - I mean,
without taking sides though, I have to say...
<br/>
Emma's save-the-date
e-mail was a smidge tacky.
<br/>
I mean, "june 6
at the Plaza", smiley face?
<br/>
What's next,
hearts over her i's?
<br/>
Come on, really, what
was she thinking? - Oh, hey.
<br/>
I know, right?
- That was so tacky.
<br/>
It's shocking.
- Hi. Hi, Heidi.
<br/>
Oh, Elizabeth, I love my ring.
- Oh, my gosh.
<br/>
Emma?
<br/>
You sent out
your save-the-dates?
<br/>
Yeah, I did, actually.
<br/>
Uh-
<br/>
Surprised?
<br/>
So one of us...
<br/>
is not moving her date?
<br/>
Well, you amaze me, Liv. You really do.
<br/>
You-You never ask me what I want.
You just figure you know best, end of story.
<br/>
"Emma, wear this.
Emma, say that."
<br/>
Well, Emma's pretty
frickin' tired of it.
<br/>
Oh, whoa. - Don't think I
didn't notice how totally freaked out...
<br/>
you were because I had the nerve
to get engaged before you did. - Okay, wait.
<br/>
First of all, Daniel
bought that ring in December.
<br/>
Okay? So officially, I was first.
<br/>
Oh, pathetic. Pathetic! - Second, people
always make you do things you don't wanna do.
<br/>
Emma, it's like you don't
have a spine. Oh, wait. That's right.
<br/>
You don't have a spine.
<br/>
Wow.
<br/>
No one could accuse you
of being soft, Liv.
<br/>
You grabbed the first date
in june Marion offered...
<br/>
without even asking me first.
<br/>
At least I'm not so
terrified of being alone...
<br/>
that I people-please
my way through life.
<br/>
Emma, you settle.
<br/>
Are you saying that
I'm settling with Fletcher?
<br/>
I wasn't thinking about Fletcher.
<br/>
You came up with
that one on your own.
<br/>
Ooh.
<br/>
Move your date, Liv.
<br/>
You move your date, Emma.
<br/>
It's done. You lose.
<br/>
Your wedding better watch it.
<br/>
What did you just say?
<br/>
I said your wedding
should be very scared right now.
<br/>
If I were your wedding,
I'd sleep with one eye open.
<br/>
Why don't you just
save your threats for Daniel?
<br/>
After all, isn't that how
you got a proposal out of him?
<br/>
That's how I did it.
- Your wedding can suck it.
<br/>
What did you just say?
My wedding can suck it?
<br/>
I said your wedding can suck it.
- Your wedding can s- be-
<br/>
I mean, yours can be, um-
<br/>
Can... can be, uh...
<br/>
not that...
<br/>
please.
<br/>
Bye, ladies.
- Hey, Liv.
<br/>
Yes.
<br/>
Your wedding will be huge.
<br/>
Just like your ass at prom.
<br/>
We're done.
<br/>
5.00, Saturday, june 6. Done.
<br/>
Done. - Hmm.
- Good.
<br/>
Now we just have to find you
another maid of honor, uh, and fast.
<br/>
You'll be spending more time
with her than with the groom.
<br/>
My friends won't take sides.
- Who says it has to be a friend?
<br/>
No! No! Not just a bridesmaid.
- This spot okay?
<br/>
Yeah. Maid of honor.
Maid of honor.
<br/>
Yeah. We were
so close in law school.
<br/>
That study group was nuts.
<br/>
Oh, sweetie, you are
my second cousin's best friend.
<br/>
Of course you were at the
very top of my maid of honor list.
<br/>
Honestly, Carla. Caitlin?
<br/>
Erin, no. I did
not sleep with him.
<br/>
All right, okay. I did, actually.
<br/>
Once. Twice.
<br/>
What difference does it make?
He was a loser, and he was lousy in-
<br/>
You did? Really?
I didn't hear that-
<br/>
Two kids? Wow. You guys
must have had really cute kids.
<br/>
Uh, yeah. Tell him I say hi, and-
<br/>
Actually, I'm hopping into a cab,
so I'm gonna give you a call a little later.
<br/>
Kevin?
- Yeah?
<br/>
I'd like to promote you-
<br/>
to mister of honor.
<br/>
Do I get- Is-
Is it, like, a pay thing?
<br/>
No. just- It's just an honor.
<br/>
Uh, have a classmate read
your draft. I think that's a great idea.
<br/>
Because by letting a
classmate read your draft-
<br/>
Oh, thank God. All right.
You guys finish the rest of this.
<br/>
Just read it yourselves.
<br/>
Did you get my note?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Can you take my
late bus patrol today?
<br/>
Sure.
<br/>
Deb?
- Yeah?
<br/>
Yeah?
<br/>
I know we're not
exactly friends. - We're not?
<br/>
Then why am I always
doing you favors? - You never do me,
<br/>
never mind.
<br/>
How'd you like
to be my maid of honor?
<br/>
Do I get to pick
out my own dress?
<br/>
I tend to draw the eye,
so it's gotta be good.
<br/>
Absolutely.
<br/>
I mean, you know, I might
make some suggestions, but-
<br/>
Oh, you know, I'm really
swamped though. I'd need a lot of help.
<br/>
What do you
think the bride is for?
<br/>
To make the maid of
honor's life easier, right?
<br/>
I mean, come on. Please.
<br/>
Aw. All right.
Since you begged.
<br/>
Okay.
- I'll be your maid of honor.
<br/>
It's gonna be great.
<br/>
It's gonna be great.
<br/>
Whew.
<br/>
Hey, can I make a suggestion?
<br/>
Have you ever heard
of"pee-not gree-gio"?
<br/>
It's this really nice white wine.
<br/>
It's very elegant.
<br/>
Mmm.
<br/>
Now, your music is-
- Yes.
<br/>
still pending, and, sadly, D.j. Humble
is no longer available on that date.
<br/>
Oh? But he and I had a deal- in principle.
<br/>
Yes, well, one of
my other brides outbid you.
<br/>
I can't give you
her name, of course.
<br/>
That bitch!
<br/>
Not you. No, a different one.
<br/>
A person.
<br/>
God, she's scary.
<br/>
You don't think that Liv-
- Yeah, I do.
<br/>
No. No. She knew
how much that meant to me.
<br/>
It's too cruel. It's too mean-spirited.
- Too in character?
<br/>
Hang on. Wait.
<br/>
Didn't you tell me
she's wearing a Vera Wang?
<br/>
Yes.
- I read those run really tight...
<br/>
and she's kind of an ex-heifer.
<br/>
No. No, she's-
<br/>
She's- Little bit.
<br/>
Mmm. Oh!
<br/>
That is good. Excellent.
<br/>
Is that like cream cheese?
It is cream cheese.
<br/>
Like a hint.
<br/>
Has Emma chosen her cake yet?
- Let's keep to our own work, shall we?
<br/>
Now, as for the flowers,
Eufloria has put in a bid.
<br/>
We just can't have the same cake, that's all.
And I have to have the seven-tiered...
<br/>
white chocolate-curl torte, enrobed
in marzipan with edible pearls and flourishes.
<br/>
Well, you're safe.
<br/>
Emma has chosen
a less extravagant cake.
<br/>
And she's always saying
that she doesn't need...
<br/>
to impress people
with how much she can spend.
<br/>
I'm just going to check
my ice sculptor Rolodex. - Right.
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
That was a dig at me.
<br/>
Emma thinks I'm showing off?
<br/>
I never thought she resented how much
money I made, but I guess I was wrong.
<br/>
Really? I didn't get
that from what she-
<br/>
Marion's eating it up.
<br/>
She likes Emma best.
<br/>
Emma always gets the sympathy vote.
I never get the sympathy vote, do I?
<br/>
Well, maybe it's asking
a little bit too much of people-
<br/>
I was worried about her cake. It could be
two Ding-Dongs and a Yodel for all I care.
<br/>
What's that? What's that?
<br/>
Don't-
<br/>
Dance lessons?
<br/>
Damn, she's competitive.
Their dance is totally gonna be better than ours.
<br/>
Let me see Canary
Song again. Dandelion. Canary.
<br/>
Isn't there something in between?
- Sort of like a burnt Canary.
<br/>
Video montage
of their lives? Really?
<br/>
It's gotta be Fletcher's idea.
- That's just-
<br/>
It's gonna be, like,
pictures of them as babies.
<br/>
You know, Emma with one tooth...
<br/>
and Fletcher in his little
superhero outfits. It's tacky.
<br/>
Can I help you?
<br/>
Yeah. Delivery for Liv Lerner.
- That's chocolate.
<br/>
I'll take that.
<br/>
Mmm. Looks good.
<br/>
"Liv, you deserve this and more."
<br/>
Isn't Daniel the sweetest?
<br/>
I'll just have one.
- Thanks.
<br/>
Just one.
<br/>
W-Was she up there?
- Yeah.
<br/>
Oh. And it's impossible to go
get them back? - No, no, no, no.
<br/>
She ate half the box already, lady.
Forty-five dollars.
<br/>
Yes. Okay.
<br/>
That is the agreed upon-
<br/>
But just so you know-
<br/>
if you heard what was actually
going on, you would totally side with me.
<br/>
You gonna tip me?
- I thought that was including tip...
<br/>
but anyway, I'll give it
to you because I'm the Paula.
<br/>
You know, I've been thinking.
<br/>
If you really want to mess
with Emma's first dance- - Mm-hmm?
<br/>
There are ways.
- Tell me more.
<br/>
I don't know, baby.
Dance class?
<br/>
Come on.
We know how to dance.
<br/>
It's a slow dance.
It's like we did in college.
<br/>
It's a waltz. It's a little more
precise than just holding each other up.
<br/>
And besides, Marion says
that our first dance...
<br/>
introduces our couple style
to the world. - Oh, well, naturally...
<br/>
I'm incredibly concerned
with our couple style.
<br/>
Space!
<br/>
I am Ricky Coo...
<br/>
the Doctor of Dance.
<br/>
I bring you motion.
I bring you rhythm.
<br/>
I bring you sex.
<br/>
Please, get on your
feet, and let's dance!
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe Marion shouldn't be recommending
Ricky Coo, Doctor of Dance so much.
<br/>
Yeah. I don't know about Ricky.
<br/>
Good for you. Doing warm-ups.
<br/>
Yeah, I got your voice mail saying you
wanted to push the lesson from 1.00 to 4.00.
<br/>
How long have you been here?
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
What?
- Liv.
<br/>
Uh, just give us a second.
- I mean, who does that?
<br/>
She's finally gone completely crazy.
Not that I'm surprised at all.
<br/>
I mean, she's always been nuts.
- I know. And messing with our couple style?
<br/>
There is no way I'm letting
her get away with that. - Good.
<br/>
You know who
I feel sorry for is Daniel.
<br/>
He's not even gonna
be able to control his own wife.
<br/>
What?
<br/>
No, I'm just saying- It's Liv.
Because she never thinks about. - And?
<br/>
I'm going inside.
- What?
<br/>
The final month before the
big day is a litmus test for couples...
<br/>
ofhow they work together,
solve problems, communicate.
<br/>
The early, happy glow is over,
and the nerves begin to set in.
<br/>
With some couples, it brings out the
fundamental conflicts in their relationship.
<br/>
With other couples,
the lucky ones...
<br/>
it highlights the essential
harmony of their partnership.
<br/>
Of course, even the luckiest bride
needs something to take the edge off.
<br/>
Ooh, for me! Ajolly Walrus cookie
bouquet. Is Daniel a keeper or what?
<br/>
I'd just be careful.
Miss Wang is a stern mistress.
<br/>
Video montage- If there's gonna be
live pictures and, like, video footage-
<br/>
I know. It's, like, verging
on being a digital short.
<br/>
I don't know how they're gonna
cut me out of the footage. I'm in everything.
<br/>
Oh, this came
for you via messenger.
<br/>
I can't wait to
get into this one.
<br/>
Mr. Simmons called again asking
for the update on the agreement.
<br/>
Rutherford Rress? That's my hometown.
- I'm just gonna take this.
<br/>
Suppose I should just tell them
you're dealing with a crisis?
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
They still print
engagement announcements.
<br/>
I'm sort of like a celebrity
back there, probably.
<br/>
You know, it's like, local girl
makes good. Such sweet people.
<br/>
Oh, wow!
- What the?
<br/>
That's not you. Is it?
<br/>
Emma looks gorgeous.
<br/>
But not on the inside, which is-
- Kevin.
<br/>
It's the best
she can do, huh?
<br/>
So lame. She wants to
play dirty? I can play dirty.
<br/>
You can play dirty.
I've seen you do it.
<br/>
I went to law school, people.
<br/>
I'm starting to think
that 30 is the cutoff.
<br/>
Mmm. - Because it's the last time
men want to date women their age.
<br/>
A 30-year-old guy will
date a 30-year-old girl.
<br/>
But a 35-year-old guy
wants someone 30.
<br/>
A 40-year-old guy
wants someone 30, too, or 28.
<br/>
Mm-hmm.
- It's a terrible planet.
<br/>
I know. You know
what I was wondering?
<br/>
What are the real reasons behind
Emma and Fletcher having to tie the knot?
<br/>
Why can't they change
their date? Think about it.
<br/>
She's pregnant!
Emma's pregnant!
<br/>
Oh, no.
<br/>
Oh, no!
- Liv?
<br/>
Are you all right?
What the hell is goin' on?
<br/>
Look, let me inI
<br/>
I gained five pounds.
Five pounds. It might as well be 50!
<br/>
The dress doesn't fit!
And if the dress doesn't fit...
<br/>
my wedding's gonna be a big
black hole in the history of the Plaza!
<br/>
Well, "A "it's our wedding, hon.
<br/>
And "B"...
so what? Let it out.
<br/>
You don't alter
Vera Wang to fit you.
<br/>
You alter yourself to fit Vera.
<br/>
What do boys
learn in school? - Sorry.
<br/>
It's not the
end of the world.
<br/>
Really. What... what... what
can I do to make you feel better?
<br/>
It's what you can stop
doing. This is all your fault.
<br/>
It's sweet of you to send me
those treats, but I... - What treats?
<br/>
You know, the treats.
The Truffle-opolis.
<br/>
The truffle tray.
<br/>
Thejolly Walrus cookie bouquet?
<br/>
International Butter Club?
<br/>
The... honey...
I didn't send you any of that.
<br/>
Oh, my God, Emma!
<br/>
She's trying to make me fat
so I can't fit into my dress!
<br/>
What is that?
What is that?
<br/>
The International Butter Club?
<br/>
You mean, you've
actually been sitting around...
<br/>
eating sticks of butter
from different lands?
<br/>
The final week before
the wedding is do-or-die.
<br/>
I expect my
brides to be flawless.
<br/>
Rerfect hair,
skin, nails, everything.
<br/>
Hello there. I need
to get to the back really fast.
<br/>
Really, really fast, because
I left something there yesterday.
<br/>
It's very important that I-
- I so don't care.
<br/>
Go on back.
<br/>
Miss Allan.
- Oh, hi.
<br/>
Hi. Bit of Honey today?
That's the one I loaded.
<br/>
Yes, but, uh, just
a pre-wedding glow.
<br/>
Sure thing.
- Okay, thanks.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in time you'll see
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
on your parade
<br/>
<br/>
raining, raining, raining
<br/>
<br/>
Wow!
<br/>
What happened to you?
You look like a traffic cone.
<br/>
Will it fade?
<br/>
Sort of.
This is three loofahs.
<br/>
Is it that bad? Fletch said
he didn't think it was that bad.
<br/>
Oh, well, honey,
"Filch" is your fiance.
<br/>
He probably told you
you had nice hair too.
<br/>
This wedding stuff is
not a walk in the park.
<br/>
For sure.
- I'm surprised. I don't know.
<br/>
I'm surprised I haven't been,
you know, sent into my therapist's office.
<br/>
That's what I've heard. T-U-F-F.
<br/>
You should have heard me
on the phone the other day...
<br/>
talking to the guy who messed
up my centerpieces. - Oh, gosh.
<br/>
It was unbelievable. It's like one
thing after another, every single time.
<br/>
It snowballs. - Listen, can
I get a little bit more lowlight?
<br/>
Yeah, especially right here. Hold that
thought, sweetie. I'm gonna get your color.
<br/>
Just make sure it's not so,
like, more gold base.
<br/>
on your parade
<br/>
<br/>
raining, raining over you
<br/>
Maybe I should take up chanting.
<br/>
I think it's kind of- might be
necessary at this time of my life.
<br/>
Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Is it good?
<br/>
Great!
<br/>
I get to do noth-
<br/>
Okay. I-I don't know
what happened. Um-
<br/>
I gotta let it
sit for a day or two.
<br/>
Maybe I'll try to
strip it down to white.
<br/>
My hair's blue!
<br/>
It's blue! I have blue hair!
<br/>
I'm getting married in a week.
- Congratulations.
<br/>
In a week! A week!
<br/>
Come on.
I know you're in here.
<br/>
Ah, here's your video montage.
<br/>
Oh, yeah.
<br/>
Absolutely.
<br/>
Fletch?
<br/>
Bug? Do you have
something you need to tell me?
<br/>
Um-
- Are we about to have a little orange baby?
<br/>
Apparently we're registered
at Babies "R" Us.
<br/>
Isn't that nice?
<br/>
Marissa. Where are you?
I can barely hear you.
<br/>
I can't believe you told Emma.
<br/>
Whatever.
<br/>
You guys, don't get too
attached to the dancers.
<br/>
They're paid to be nice to you.
<br/>
Yeah!
- New York and Japan
<br/>
Hello, bride!
<br/>
All right, all right.
Now a little birdie has just told me...
<br/>
that we have a bride-to-be
in the house tonight.
<br/>
Over here!
- But she has been a very bad bride.
<br/>
Officer Not-Your-Husband
is here to arrest youI
<br/>
you know what I mean
<br/>
- You're under arrest...
<br/>
for being too sexy.
<br/>
Time to be frisked.
<br/>
Oh, my goodness!
<br/>
Great!
<br/>
We got two brides
in the house tonight!
<br/>
Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Hold upI
<br/>
We have two brides
in the house tonight.
<br/>
Emma, this party is invitation only.
<br/>
I'm getting married too, baby!
<br/>
Well, I'll invite you right up there.
<br/>
Dj jazzles invites bride number
two up on stage. - Why not?
<br/>
Come on up here, girlI
We want to see the way you moveI
<br/>
That's what I'm talking about!
Work it out, girl!
<br/>
You can't even let me
have my own bachelorette party?
<br/>
Much the way you couldn't let me
have Dj Humble. That was low, Liv.
<br/>
By the way, did you hear?
I'm not pregnant, okay?
<br/>
I say it's time for
a dance-off. Dance-off!
<br/>
Dance-off! Dance-off!
Dance-off! Dance-off!
<br/>
<br/>
- Oh! Oh!
<br/>
- Come on, Livi
<br/>
<br/>
Aw, come on, Liv.
- Come on, bride number one.
<br/>
I know y'all can do better than that.
- Give it to me, baby
<br/>
Sprockets!
<br/>
Break it downI Now the sexiest bride
takes first prize. Let's see it!
<br/>
We gonna get
this party started, y'all!
<br/>
Showdown!
<br/>
Space!
<br/>
Check out bride number two!
<br/>
wiggle around look at 'em droolin'
<br/>
sound I keep 'em movin'
<br/>
in the air it's all right now
<br/>
your feet the whole night now
<br/>
Yeah, drink that up, man
<br/>
Well, that was the plan
<br/>
Wasn't ready for this
<br/>
No, I'm talkin'bout Swiss
<br/>
<br/>
from the hood to Dubai
<br/>
Bride number two, you are
the sexiest bride of the night, baby.
<br/>
Give it up for bride number two, y'allI
<br/>
Sorry, bride number one.
Can't win 'em all, girl.
<br/>
It's weird, losing.
I gotta say I'm not loving it.
<br/>
No, but you were both so good.
<br/>
Yeah, you really got
up there, and you tried.
<br/>
Forget it. It's my
bachelorette party, right? - Yes.
<br/>
Good girl. Here you go.
<br/>
It's like you read my mind.
<br/>
Oh, my God!
<br/>
Taxi! Taxi.
<br/>
Kevin. Kevin. I need coffee.
<br/>
Excuse me. I need coffee.
I need three Advil.
<br/>
Yeah. Four waters.
<br/>
Get a splash of that Kahlua
next to wherever that paralegal is.
<br/>
Hey, Elana.
- Good morning.
<br/>
You work too hard. I'm
gonna treat you to lunch. - Okay.
<br/>
Where are you, Kev? Are you
in the office? - I hear you coming. Liv?
<br/>
Liv, blue! Hair!
- Hey, Advil.
<br/>
You have blue hair!
<br/>
Oh, my God.
I totally forgot.
<br/>
I was supposed to get it
dyed back at 7.00.
<br/>
I think it's very... it's gonna be...
they're gonna love it.
<br/>
I got it.
I'm gonna figure it out.
<br/>
If we could all refer to the briefs I've
drawn up. I've highlighted a few main points.
<br/>
Our discovery process in
depositions and document requests-
<br/>
maybe you guys could share that
one... has yielded significant results.
<br/>
W... w... wait. Okay. I am looking
at the brief dated two weeks ago.
<br/>
Where is the latest version?
- I could have sworn that I updated these.
<br/>
Just a second.
<br/>
Goddamn it!
<br/>
Your hair.
<br/>
Yes, my hair.
My hair... is blue!
<br/>
My hair is blue. My wedding's in
a week, and I'm paying my maid of honor.
<br/>
Okay? Or rather
Mrs. Colson is.
<br/>
And, yes, maybe
I misplaced the briefl.
<br/>
And, yes, maybe my best friend
in the world forever hates me!
<br/>
Hates me!
<br/>
Oh, my God.
<br/>
I'm gonna be a bald bride.
<br/>
It's so not ideal.
<br/>
This is who's representing us?
<br/>
Not anymore. Miss Lerner's
off the case. I'm taking over.
<br/>
No, now look, calm down.
I'm gonna get it dyed back.
<br/>
Miss Lerner.
<br/>
You are excused.
<br/>
I'm not this girl.
<br/>
I just don't screw up.
I just don't get demoted.
<br/>
It's like I don't have
anybody. I feel so alone.
<br/>
Hey.
<br/>
Babe, I'm right here.
<br/>
You miss your friend,
especially now.
<br/>
She'd know just what to say.
<br/>
I'm mad at her too.
<br/>
She went for the hair.
Girlfriends don't do that.
<br/>
You'll fix it.
And if you can't, I love it.
<br/>
I do. You're like this very tall,
very hot Smurf.
<br/>
Oh, honey.
<br/>
It's not just about the hair.
<br/>
I'm mad because
maybe she's right.
<br/>
And it's exhausting having to
try to be perfect all the time.
<br/>
That's how I held it together
ever since I was a kid.
<br/>
I figured nothing- nothing bad
would happen again if I was just...
<br/>
one step ahead of everything
and everybody, all the time.
<br/>
Life isn't perfect, hon.
<br/>
It's messy.
<br/>
You're right.
<br/>
I mean, I was gonna
be perfect for you...
<br/>
but now that you say
it's impossible- Hey.
<br/>
No, you don't. No, you
don't have to be perfect.
<br/>
I've always
wanted a human wife.
<br/>
Yeah, the other ones
are just... too hard to inflate.
<br/>
Hey.
- Hey.
<br/>
Almost back to normal, huh?
- I know, right?
<br/>
I have, like, one layer of skin left,
but that should be okay for our wedding.
<br/>
So, oops, sorry, Liv.
<br/>
I wish I had
pictures. You know?
<br/>
It's like I was up there, and there's
this spotlight, and when I hit that rope-
<br/>
Oh, my God!
- Hey! Enough, enough, enough!
<br/>
I've heard this story
10.000 times, Emma.
<br/>
You've been acting
a little wild lately. Okay?
<br/>
And I'm tired of it.
So knock it off.
<br/>
Lately you've been very
mad and tense and excited.
<br/>
You know what? I just don't
know how to deal with this.
<br/>
Uh-huh. - And quite frankly, you
have me questioning whether or not...
<br/>
this is something about- to do with
the wedding or if this is permanent.
<br/>
Um, well, Fletcher, it is kind
of permanent. You know?
<br/>
It is possible that I might be mad or tense or
excited more than once in the next 40 years.
<br/>
Is it? Really? You know what?
You're doing it right now.
<br/>
What? - You're being,
not, I mean, not bitchy, but,
<br/>
I said "not bitchy." But you're
right there in that neighborhood.
<br/>
You should have the cab,
like, take a U-turn...
<br/>
drop you off at Pleasant
and Nice, where we met.
<br/>
Are you upset because of this thing
with Liv, or because I'm having feelings?
<br/>
Totally. - Because it's
kind of hard to read you.
<br/>
My God! That's totally it. I'm upset
because you have feelings. You nailed it.
<br/>
Okay. So in other words, then don't have
so many feelings, but if I do, don't show 'em.
<br/>
I shouldn't have so many-
- Oh, God! I can't even talk to you right now!
<br/>
You haven't tried yet. Do you realize-
Do you know how hard this is for me?
<br/>
I don't even know who you are.
- You have not even tried to ask me about how I'm feeling.
<br/>
I'm so confused.
- I don't even know who you are.
<br/>
All right? I don't want to talk.
<br/>
It's a tense time. We're fine.
Whatever. I was gonna go to the gym.
<br/>
Bye.
<br/>
<br/>
since you left me
<br/>
Emma?
- The closed blinds in my home
<br/>
Emma! Emma!
-See no light of day
<br/>
<br/>
to hear the radio
<br/>
in a shady space
<br/>
<br/>
your favorite book
<br/>
Liv Lerner's office.
<br/>
Hey, Kevin.
It's Emma. Is Liv there?
<br/>
I'm sorry, can you hold on?
Just a minute, I- Sorry.
<br/>
It's my worst nightmare.
I'm "cubicle-ized."
<br/>
I'm sorry, Liv's dealing with
a crisis right now. Can we return?
<br/>
Fine. That's-
<br/>
Yeah. Okay, I get it. Bye.
<br/>
Hey! I'm sorry. Who is this?
- I'm scared to face another day
<br/>
Hello? - 'Cause the fear
in me just won't go away
<br/>
you were gone
<br/>
<br/>
Hey!
<br/>
Hi!
<br/>
How are you?
- Long time, huh?
<br/>
I know. It's my fault. I've been really busy.
- Oh, yeah. Right. Busy.
<br/>
Nothing to do with the fact that I'm
the brother of your archenemy. I mean, best friend.
<br/>
Hey! I have to rent a tux.
<br/>
You're coming with me. Come on.
<br/>
Um, okay.
- Come on.
<br/>
I'm a little surprised. I would have thought
a big magazine writer would have his own tux.
<br/>
How you doing, Em? Hmm?
How you feeling?
<br/>
Um, feel fine.
<br/>
Fine's not really
a feeling though.
<br/>
Fine's a feeling.
<br/>
"I feel fine." You could
say that. People say that.
<br/>
Yeah, sure.
You can say that.
<br/>
Okay. It's, like-
<br/>
Things are crazy
with the wedding.
<br/>
And there are all these
details and... I don't know.
<br/>
I had this idea of how
it was gonna be in my head, and-
<br/>
And it's not as much
fun as that. - Mm-hmm.
<br/>
And I don't know why.
<br/>
But mostly, I am fine.
<br/>
Let's fix your tie.
I can't look at a tie like this.
<br/>
Yeah. Change the subject.
- This doesn't look right without a tie.
<br/>
I'm gonna go with a clip-on
'cause I can't figure this out.
<br/>
You have no patience.
- Really?
<br/>
Mm-mmm.
<br/>
Kind of think I wait
around too long.
<br/>
Hey, let me buy
you a cup of coffee.
<br/>
Oh, um, I... I can't.
I'm late for, um...
<br/>
but I'll call you.
<br/>
Um, when I'm not-You-That-
You look, um, you look really-
<br/>
You're gonna make a very
handsome bride "giver-awayer."
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
And, Em, you're gonna make
a beautiful bride. Really.
<br/>
Yeah? - Yeah.
I always thought so.
<br/>
Thanks. Bye.
<br/>
Despite it all, when morning
broke on that 6th of june...
<br/>
it was the perfect
day for a wedding.
<br/>
Well, two weddings.
<br/>
T- minus three hours, people.
<br/>
Guard your camps, execute your duties,
and we may make it out of here alive.
<br/>
Incoming, people.
<br/>
Roses for Lerner.
Peonies for Allan.
<br/>
Has the Allan officiant reported
for duty yet? - Yes, he has.
<br/>
Linens for Lerner?
- Yes.
<br/>
Excellent.
<br/>
Let's move, people.
This is not a dress rehearsal.
<br/>
Amazing. You can't even
see the blue anymore.
<br/>
Oh, Liv.
<br/>
My God, you're the most
beautiful bride I have ever seen.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Oh, uh, excuse me a sec.
<br/>
She's so weird.
<br/>
God, I'm so nervous.
I don't know why.
<br/>
Is the veil supposed to
go like that? - Yes. Why?
<br/>
Oh, no. You look fine.
<br/>
You know, honestly, the pressure
we put on brides these days to look perfect.
<br/>
It's just ridiculous.
<br/>
You don't have to look your most beautiful
on your wedding day. Okay, everybody?
<br/>
Mom!
<br/>
You know, if
you want my opinion...
<br/>
You know what, Deb? I don't.
I don't want your opinion.
<br/>
Wh... what?
<br/>
Deb, I have been dealing
with versions of you my whole life...
<br/>
and I'm gonna
tell you something...
<br/>
that I should've told
myself a long time ago.
<br/>
Sometimes it's about me, okay?
<br/>
Not all the time, but every once
in a while it's my time. Like today.
<br/>
If you're not okay
with that, feel free to go.
<br/>
But if you stay,
you have to do your job.
<br/>
And that means smiling and
talking about my bridal beauty...
<br/>
and, most importantly,
not making it about you.
<br/>
Okay? Can you do that?
<br/>
Yes, I'd like to.
<br/>
Then we're good.
<br/>
Harpist is Allan.
Quartet is Lerner.
<br/>
How many times
do I have to repeat myself?
<br/>
Check on the grooms' status and
man your battle stations. - Okay.
<br/>
If you're about to jump
ship from one wedding...
<br/>
let someone else know
so we can create a diversion.
<br/>
Okay. - I'm going to Liv's ceremony
and Emma's reception. More booze.
<br/>
I'm gonna do a quick head count of
the hot drunk single guys and then choose.
<br/>
Good call.
- Allan. Lerner.
<br/>
Hey, Mr. Allan. How are you?
<br/>
I'm good, bud. How're you?
- Big day, huh?
<br/>
Yes. Yes, it is.
<br/>
I caught a glimpse of Emma when
I was scouting out the enemy camp.
<br/>
She is beautiful, sir.
<br/>
Thank you, Nathan.
<br/>
Listen, you think I could
have a word with your sister?
<br/>
Not about the-the fight, about
something else. - Oh, yeah. Sure.
<br/>
Liv.
<br/>
Hi! Mr. Allan!
<br/>
Oh, Liv.
<br/>
Wow. Your mom and
dad would be so proud.
<br/>
Thank you.
- Of both of you.
<br/>
Thank you.
- Thanks.
<br/>
I just want to pass on a
blessing from our generation.
<br/>
Not just from myself but from...
<br/>
f- from my dear friends who would've
given anything to be here today.
<br/>
Good luck, sweetheart.
- Oh.
<br/>
Nate.
- Mr. Allan, thank you.
<br/>
Good to see you.
- All right.
<br/>
You too.
<br/>
Such a good man.
Emma's so much like him.
<br/>
So, according to Ms. St. Claire,
you are allowed one weak nip...
<br/>
before the wedding,
to sort of steady the nerves.
<br/>
So we have scotch-
- Okay. Scotch is good.
<br/>
We have vodka and tequila.
<br/>
Tequila, tequila?
Tequila! Tequila!
<br/>
Kevin! Tequila.
- Tequila's so trashy.
<br/>
No, no, no. Kevin. Kevin, listen to me.
- You don't even like tequila.
<br/>
You take this to Marion.
You tell her I switched the DVD's.
<br/>
She needs to play this
when Emma walks down the aisle.
<br/>
I thought we were rising
above this sort of thing.
<br/>
We are, which is why I need you
to do this for me right now. Hurry!
<br/>
You'll thank me one day.
<br/>
I'll go get that.
<br/>
That's very helpful.
- Okay.
<br/>
Thank you.
<br/>
Oh, my God. It's your parents.
<br/>
Come on in. Look,
isn't she a bridal beauty?
<br/>
She sure is.
Oh, my gosh.
<br/>
Oh, wow, Mom.
- Oh, my God! Is that my dress?
<br/>
Are you happy?
<br/>
I'm happy if you're happy.
<br/>
Sweetheart, you could get married
in a brown paper bag, I wouldn't care.
<br/>
This is your day.
<br/>
Oh, boy, I need a tissue.
<br/>
Oh, my God. I'm gonna cry.
- You're gonna screw up your makeup, honey.
<br/>
I found this when we
moved to Boca, and I saved it.
<br/>
Dad. What is it? - I knew
there'd come a day to give it to you.
<br/>
Go ahead. Open it.
<br/>
In case you need
something old or blue.
<br/>
It's really Liv's.
<br/>
Well, something borrowed then.
<br/>
Daddy, I need to see her.
<br/>
I think she
feels the same way.
<br/>
I'll get that.
<br/>
Oh, it's Marion.
<br/>
Uh, places, people.
We're on in two.
<br/>
Marion, could I just run
down the hallway for a second?
<br/>
Emma, you are the most beautiful
bride I have ever seen. Ready.
<br/>
Bride one, walking. Bride one, walking.
- Oh.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- It's time.
<br/>
between the trees
<br/>
bark and leaves
<br/>
my pretty bed of green
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ma'am.
<br/>
Oh, my God.
- Okay. Okay.
<br/>
I'm getting married.
- Yeah. Are you happy?
<br/>
Uh-
<br/>
When I get visual
confirmation on bride one walking...
<br/>
give video a five count and roll.
<br/>
And ready.
<br/>
Walk.
<br/>
I'm in Acapulco, baby!
Spring break!
<br/>
I'm here with Miguel.
<br/>
I love spring break!
I want to dance!
<br/>
Go, Emma! Go, Emma!
<br/>
I love being Emma!
- I...
<br/>
We've been hit.
Repeat, we've been hit.
<br/>
Emma!
<br/>
Let me tell you
something about that tape!
<br/>
God, you swore! You swore
you'd never show that to anyone.
<br/>
Just... let them go.
<br/>
Emma!
<br/>
Bring it on!
<br/>
Emma! I don't want to fight!
<br/>
Let me just tell you something!
- I don't want to fight!
<br/>
It's over.
I can't do this anymore.
<br/>
I can't do this anymore.
<br/>
Thank God.
<br/>
I'm fine.
<br/>
Emma, what the hell are
you doing? Have you lost your mind?
<br/>
You just ruined our
wedding. You happy now?
<br/>
Your friend? History. 'Cause she's a bad
influence on you, and she always has been.
<br/>
Judging by that DVD, you're
a lot more like her than I thought.
<br/>
Good. I hope so.
- What?
<br/>
Fletcher, you've been
my friend for 10 years.
<br/>
I need you to be my friend
now and tell me the truth.
<br/>
You're in love with a girl
that you met 10 years ago.
<br/>
Hey, what's the
matter with that? Huh?
<br/>
She's not here anymore.
<br/>
I don't want to spend
the rest of my life fighting, Fletch.
<br/>
Or caving.
<br/>
Neither do you.
<br/>
We're different.
We want different things.
<br/>
You know that's true, don't you?
<br/>
I knew.
<br/>
Good-bye.
<br/>
Oh, my God. Emma.
<br/>
I'm fine.
<br/>
This is all my fault.
That video was never supposed to happen.
<br/>
I mean, it was supposed to
happen, but I canceled it. I thought I did.
<br/>
'Cause I could never do that to you.
Emma, you're my best friend.
<br/>
Oh, this fighting is so dumb.
<br/>
I'm so sorry about everything.
<br/>
I'm sorry... too.
<br/>
I'm so sorry.
<br/>
If I ruined it for you,
I don't want it anymore.
<br/>
If Fletcher and I were
perfect for each other, then...
<br/>
we'd be getting
married, and we're not.
<br/>
Are you crying?
<br/>
Yeah. It's like
a whole new me.
<br/>
And I just...
I cry all the time.
<br/>
I'm kind of a basket case.
- No, Liv, I didn't want that. I'm sorry.
<br/>
No. No, you were right.
<br/>
I don't have to have it
constantly together all the time.
<br/>
It's like... this
huge wake-up call.
<br/>
And I'm kind of stumbling
around a little bit, but...
<br/>
I'm awake.
<br/>
Will you stand up there with me?
<br/>
Where else would I be?
<br/>
Reset, people. Reset.
<br/>
Oh, I almost forgot something.
<br/>
Oh, my God. Em?
Where did you find that?
<br/>
Two little girls saved it for us.
<br/>
Come on.
<br/>
Hi.
<br/>
Hey. Are you single?
- Uh, yeah.
<br/>
Are you straight?
- I don't like labels.
<br/>
So sorry to hear
about your divorce.
<br/>
Why? It was only my first.
<br/>
And next time, I'm definitely
getting married at the Plaza.
<br/>
I'm about to lose my mind
<br/>
very happy
<br/>
Do you wanna dance?
- Yes.
<br/>
Let's go.
- Okay.
<br/>
Um-
<br/>
No, baby. Baby,
let it happen on its own.
<br/>
Uh-oh. Did I make a horrible mistake and
marry someone who's smarter than I am?
<br/>
It was quite a wedding.
<br/>
And as I stood there watching...
<br/>
I realized something
I'd forgotten a long time ago.
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in life there really are
bonds formed that can never be broken.
<br/>
Sometimes, you really can
find that one person...
<br/>
who will stand by you
no matter what.
<br/>
Maybe you'll find it in a spouse
and celebrate it with your dream wedding.
<br/>
But there's also the chance...
<br/>
that the one person
you can count on for a lifetime-
<br/>
the one person who knows you...
<br/>
sometimes better
than you know yourself-
<br/>
is the same person who's been
standing beside you all along.
<br/>
Wow! You look great.
- Hello. Oh, my God. You look great.
<br/>
Well, how was it?
How was the vacation?
<br/>
It was amazing.
- I want to know everything about it.
<br/>
Actually, I don't.
You married my brother. That's weird.
<br/>
So I don't want
to know anything, ever.
<br/>
Should we toast?
To marriage?
<br/>
Um, actually,
I'm not drinking.
<br/>
Neither am I.
<br/>
Are you pregnant?
<br/>
When are-
- Me too. March third.
<br/>
When're you due? March third.
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
'Bout loving anyone
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
waiting on you
<br/>
<br/>
get the chance, baby
<br/>
<br/>
-Love me, baby
<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
- Love me, baby
<br/>
- just once
<br/>
<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
without burning up
<br/>
<br/>
you get a chance
<br/>
<br/>
- Love me, baby
<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
-Love me, baby
<br/>
- Do, do
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
- Do, do, do
<br/>
