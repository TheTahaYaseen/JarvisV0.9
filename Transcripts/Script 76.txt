(Now in the present. A young girl steps out of her house and walks down the path to the village.)
(Meanwhile, Belle continues her stroll downtown.)
(3 men are looking in window, then turning to watch her)
(Belle sits on the edge of a fountain, singing to the sheep and the washing
woman in the background, who leaves)
(<i>Geese flying overhead, one is shot and plummets to the ground. Lefou runs over, holds out the bag, and misses catching the prize. He returns to Gaston</i>)
(Belle walks by and away)
(Belle walks easily through the crowd of people in the town, Gaston struggles to catch up to her)
(Townsfolk gather around Gaston, and eventually surround him)
(<i>The Bimbettes, who are looking on, sigh.</i>)
(Gaston and Lefou laugh heartily)
(Explosion in background. Gaston and Lefou continue laughing. Belle rushes home and descends into the basement.)
(Fade to later in the day)
(Maurice and Phillipe continue on their journey until they become lost)
(Phillipe looks right, at a dark, overgrown path, then left towards a more inviting route, then begins to go left)
(Phillipe and Maurice continue through the dark.)
(A swarm of bats fly out of a tree. Phillipe runs through the forest avoiding everything until he almost runs over the edge of a cliff)
(He looks up and sees wolves growling at him. Maurice runs away, being chased by the wolves. He stumbles down a hill, and lands at the gate of a castle. He grabs the locked gate and tries to shake it open.)
(The gate opens, and Maurice runs in. He slams the gate in the faces of the wolves. Leaving his hat on the ground as the rain begins to fall, Maurice runs to the castle and bangs on the door. It creaks open and he enters, cautiously.)
(Watching from a table near the entrance are Lumière and Cogsworth)
(Cogsworth puts hand over Lumière's mouth, who promptly proceeds to touch his lit candle hand to Cogsworth's hand.)
(He picks up the candlestick for light, not realizing that the speaker is in his hand)
(Maurice sneezes in the face of Cogsworth, who proceeds to wipe his face off using his clock hands in a very anachronistic windshield wiper manner. Maurice sniffles, indicating the cold he has caught from being in the rain.)
(Lumière and Maurice head towards the den, with Cogsworth running after them.)
(Beast is watching the action from an overhead walkway, and rushes off as the trio enters the den.) 
(Cogsworth is run over by the (once again) anachronistic IndyCar sounding teacart of Mrs. Potts)
(The door to the den slams open and a strong gust of wind blows into the room, extinguishing Lumière's flames and the fire in the fireplace. Cogsworth dives for cover. Mrs. Potts begins to shake. Chip jumps back onto the tea cart and takes refuge from behind his mother)
(Beast enters. We see him in full for the first time. He is on all fours. He looks around in the darkness.)
(Lumière's last sentence is drowned out by the very loud growl of Beast, which puts out his flames once again. Lumière looks down, dejected.)
(Again, Beast's growl drowns out Cogsworth.)
(Maurice looks to one side of the chair, then to the other and sees Beast.)
(Beast picks up Maurice, carries him out of the room and slams the door, plunging the den, along with Cogsworth, Lumière,Mrs. Potts, and Chip into darkness. Fade out.)
(Fade in to Belle's cottage, seen from POV of Gaston and Lefou.)
(Gaston lets go of a branch, which swings back and hits Lefou in the mouth. Gaston turns to the band, wedding guests and others, apparently just out of sight of Belle's cottage.)
(MINISTER, BAKER, and OTHERS laugh heartily. Camera pans quickly to show Bimbettes crying their eyes out. To Lefou)
(Cut to interior of cottage. Belle is sitting in a chair reading her new book. There is a knock at the door. She puts the book down and walks to the door. She reaches up and pulls down a viewing device. She peeks through and sees an anachronistically accurate fish-eye view of Gaston. She moans, and pushes the door open.)
(She twists the knob and the door opens. Belle ducks under Gaston as he tumbles out the door and into the mud.)
(The wedding band begins to play "Here Comes the Bride." Gaston's boots are thrown out of the door (now opened inward) and the door is slammed shut. Lefou, who is directing the band, looks down and sees Gaston's legs sticking out of the mud, and Pierre's head sticking up. Lefou cuts off the band, and Gaston's head pops up, with the pig on top of him. He tilts his head, and the pig slides down his back.)
(Gaston walks off, dejected, and the focus returns to the cottage. Belle pokes her head out the door.)
(Belle walks into the pen and feeds the animals, then runs off singing into an open field overlooking a beautiful valley)
(Phillipe runs into the open field. Belle looks at him, disturbed that Maurice is not with him.)
(Belle unhitches the wagon from Phillipe.)
(Cut to exterior of the castle gate. (How Phillipe brought Belle there is a mystery, seeing as Phillipe never made it to the castle with Maurice.))
(Phillipe snorts, then begins to buck as if something is scaring him. Belle dismounts and comforts him.)
(Cut to interior of castle with Cogsworth and Lumière discussing events.)
(Cut back to door opening and Belle entering castle.)
(We follow as Belle ascends the grand staircase and searches for her father. Cut to kitchen where Mrs. Potts is standing next to a tub of hot water. Chip hops in.)
(Cut back to Lumière and Cogsworth bickering)
(Cogsworth and Lumière turn to look at the new arrival)
(Belle advances down a narrow hallway. Cogsworth and Lumière sneak up behind her and open the door that leads to the tower where Maurice is being kept. The door creaks open and Belle hears the sound)
(She begins up the stairs, but doesn't realize that Lumière is watching her.)
(Maurice's voice echoes from his cell)
(Suddenly, Beast grabs Belle's shoulder and whips her around. She drops the torch she was carrying into a puddle and the room is dark except for one beam of light from a skylight.)
(Belle ponders the situation and realizes she can't see the captor)
(Beast drags his legs, then his whole body into the beam of light. Belle looks, her eyes growing wider until she can stand no more and falls back to Maurice.)
(Belle regains her composure, then steps into the beam of light, giving her a very virgin-ish look)
(Beast moves over to unlock the cell, and Belle collapses to the floor with her head in her hands. We hear the door being unlocked, then Maurice rushing over to Belle.)
(Beast grabs him and drags him downstairs)
(Cut to exterior of castle. Beast drags Maurice towards Pallequin)
(The PALLENQUIN breaks the ivy holding it to the ground, then slinks off like a spider with Maurice inside)
(Cut to Belle looking out cell window at the PALLENQUIN crossing the bridge over the moat. She begins to cry. Cut to Beast walking up the stairs. Lumière is still at his post.)
(Beast enters the cell where Belle is still crying.)
(Beast leads Belle to her room. As they proceed, Belle begins to lag behind. She looks at the hideous sculptures on the walls and the light casting shadows on them. Frightened, she gasps and runs to catch up with Beast, who is carrying Lumière as a light source. Beast looks back at Belle, and sees a tear form at the corner of her eye.)
(Beast continues, and Belle reluctantly follows. Cut to interior of Belle's room dark. The door opens and light spills in.)
(Beast leaves, slamming the door behind him. Belle, terrified, runs over to the
bed and flings herself onto it, finally breaking down and crying.
(Fade to tavern in the town.)
(cheering from the gallery)
(Lefou turns chair back to forward)
(Lefou has pulled a man's belt off, whose pants fall to the ground. Lefou jumps up and wraps the belt around Gaston's neck, who flexes and breaks it off. Lefou continues to dance around. Cronies pick him up and swing him around.)
(Old cronies swing Lefou back and forth into the camera. Lefou tickles Gaston's chin, who stands with pride)
(Lefou swings up his arm in dance and throws a mug of beer in Gaston's face, who socks Lefou in the face)
(Gaston fights with the men, then lifts a bench with the Bimbettes on it. He drops the bench on Lefou, then turns to the camera and reveals his hairy chest.)
<b>ALL</b>: Ten points for Gaston!
(Gaston plays a chess game with a man, then hits the board, sending it and pieces all over. He takes a bite of leather from the belt once wrapped around his neck, chews it and spits it into a spittoon, which falls and gets stuck on the head of Lefou.)
(Gaston juggles a number of eggs, then swallows them whole. Lefou attempts the trick, and is hit in the face by three eggs.)
(Gaston takes three shots at a beer barrel, which begins leaking into the mugs of onlookers. He returns stomping to his chair, where we see the fireplace surrounded by the heads of the animals he has killed. The mystery cut of music is here! Cut to ending of "Gaston")
(The cronies have picked up the chair and carry Gaston around in it. Lefou tries to flee, but they toss the chair into its normal place, and Lefou is pinned underneath. Maurice bursts in frantically)
(Maurice has gone from person to person, pleading his case, until he is thrown at the feet of Gaston. A moment of silence, then the cronies begin to laugh and mock him.)
(The cronies pick up Maurice and help him out by throwing him through the door.)
(Lefou is still under the chair.)
(Gaston picks Lefou out from under the chair and holds his head close, and whispers)
(They begin a waltz around the floor as they sing)
(Camera zooms out through window to snow covered square, empty except for Maurice)
(Fade back to the bedroom of the castle where Belle is still crying. There is a 'clink clink clink' at the door. She gets up and walks over to open the door. Mrs. Potts enters with Chip and their entourage.)
(Belle bumps into the Wardrobe)
(Belle stands and the Wardrobe approaches her.)
(Cogsworth waddles in)
(Cut to Beast pacing back and forth in front of fire, with Mrs. Potts and Lumière looking on.)
(Lumière shrugs his shoulders and looks at Mrs. Potts.)
(Beast sits up, then straightens his face very formally)
(The door creaks open. Beast wipes the silly face off, and looks to the door expectantly.)
(Cogsworth enters.)
(Beast goes from expectant to mad.)
(Cut to exterior of den with door slightly ajar)
(Door bangs open and Beast comes running out, with Objects giving chase)
(Cut to exterior of Belle's room. Beast runs up to it and bangs on the door.)

(The magic mirror shines, then glows green and reveals Belle in her bedroom, talking to the Wardrobe)
(Another petal falls off the rose.)
(Beast puts his head in his hands as in a depressed state.)
(Fade out/Fade in to exterior of Belle's room. Door creaks open. Belle silently emerges. We see her feet go by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level. Behind it are Lumière and Featherduster.)
(Lumière and Featherduster have emerged and Lumière takes her in his arms. Suddenly he looks up and sees Belle walking down the hall. He drops Featherduster.)
(Cut to kitchen, where we find Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip and the STOVE.)
(A banging of pots and pans comes from the STOVE.)
(Belle enters, and Cogsworth cuts off Mrs. Potts before she can say 'spell.')
(Lumière comes running in.)
(He leans over to kiss her hand, but Lumière butts in front of him.)
(The fire on the STOVE roars to life, and drawers open to reveal silverwarestanding at attention.)
(Lumière has started out the swinging door. He lets it close, and the door hits Cogsworth and sends him across the room to land in a panfilled with (what looks like) pancake batter. He screams his line as he is in flight.)
(Cut to dining room, where Belle is seated at the end of a long table. Lumière is on the table and a spotlight shines on him.)
(The CHAIR has wrapped a napkin around the neck of Belle, who takes it off and places it on her lap. The CHAIR's arms put it's hands on it's 'waist' as if it were mad.)
(Lumière offers Belle a plate of hors d'oeuvres. She dips her finger in one, and tastes it.)
(A cabinet at the end of the table opens to reveal a large China collection, which rolls out and begins to perform. Lumière hands Belle a menu, which she begins to read.)
(plates of food go dancing by, with Cogsworth in the pudding. Lumière sets his torch to it, and it explodes, turning Cogsworth's face black with soot.)
(The FLATWARE enters a 'Busby Berkley-esque' swimming scene.)
(Lumière, standing on a plate, is elevated and begins to juggle his candles. Mugs enter the shot.)
(The Mugs begin a gymnastics routine, hopping over one another and passing a beverage from one to the next)
(ALL leave except Cogsworth, who looks scared, then begins to inch away. Lumière enters and holds him there.)
(Lumière sings as if he were reminiscing. Snow begins to fall. Cogsworth looks
up and sees the salt and pepper shakers doing their thing.)
(Lumière dusts the salt of the head of Cogsworth, who tries to escape. He tripsand falls into the gelatin mold.)
(Lumière jumps on a spoon in the gelatin, which catapults Cogsworth out of the mold. Cut to kitchen, where Mrs. Potts is surrounded by soap bubbles.)
(Mrs. Potts continues to dance around the kitchen)
(Mrs. Potts is cleaned off by a napkin. She hops onto the tea cart and rolls into the dining room, where she offers tea to Belle.)
(The China and candlesticks perform an elaborately choreographed dance sequence, ending in a closeup of Lumière.)
(A fantastic ending comes of the song, with SILVERWARE flying through the air, plates and Featherdusters dancing, and Cogsworth the focus of attention, until Lumière comes sliding in and sends him flying out of camera range.)
(Lumière comes up next to Cogsworth.)
(He tries to cover it up, just as a fork runs past. To Lumière)
(Cogsworth and Lumière have been fighting. They both look at her, then stop. Cogsworth dusts himself off, and Lumière fixes his wax nose.)
(Fade to Cogsworth, Lumière, and Belle walking down a hall with Sultan. Cogsworth is lecturing.)
(He turns to find the heads of the suits of armor have turned to follow Belle.)
(They all snap back to face forward.)
(Cogsworth turns back to the group and is one girl short. He sees her beginning to climb the grand staircase. He and Lumière run up to her and jump in front of her, blocking her progress upstairs.)
(Lumière has been shaking his head, but Cogsworth nudges him and he nods in agreement.)
(She steps over them, but they dash up and block her again.)
(Lumière and Cogsworth begin marching off, and Belle begins to follow, but her curiosity overtakes her, and she turns back to the West Wing. Her excitement begins to dwindle, though, when she enters the hallway leading to Beast's lair. As she walks down the hall, she stops to look in a mirror that has been shattered into several pieces, each one reflecting her concerned look. She reaches the end of the hall and finds a closed door with gargoyle handles. She takes a deep breath, then reaches out and opens the door. Cut to interior of lair, where Belle begins to explore. She is truly shocked by everything she sees. She wanders around, looking, and knocks over a table, but she catches it before it crashes to the floor. She then turns her head and sees a shredded picture on the wall. We can only see part of a portrait. It is the same portrait that was shredded in the opening. Belle reaches out and lifts the shreds of the picture to reveal the prince. We never see this, however, for then she turns her head and sees the rose under the bell jar. She walks over to it, her eyes transfixed. She reaches out, then lifts off the jar, leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches up, brushes back the strand of hair that has been repeatedly falling on her forehead, then reaches out to touch the rose. As she nears it, a shadow falls over her. Beast has been on the balcony, and sees her. He jumps back into the room, then slams the jar back on the rose. He then turns his attention to Belle.)
(Belle turns and flees the room. Beast calms down, then falls into despair, finally realizing that he may have destroyed his chances with Belle. She reaches the stairway and grabs her cloak. She rushes down the stairs, wrapping the cloak around her and bursting past a confused Lumière and Cogsworth .)
(Lumière tries to respond, but Belle slams the door behind her. He and Cogsworth both bow their heads in sadness. Cut to Belle outside in the forest on Phillipe. She begins to ride through the forest, but Phillipe comes to a stop. She looks up and sees the wolves. She gasps, then pulls the reins and begins to flee. She runs from side to side, making the wolves hit the trees (a la Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi). Phillipe runs out on a frozen pond, but his and Belle's weight collapse the ice. The wolves chase her into the water. Some begin to drown, but Phillipe is able to get out of the water before anything serious happens. He runs into a clearing, but becomes surrounded by wolves. He bucks, throwing Belle off and wrapping the reins around a tree branch. The wolves begin their attack on Phillipe, but Belle comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick. One WOLF grabs the stick in its mouth and breaks half of it off, leaving Belle defenseless. Another leaps at her, grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground. She looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her. It leaps and is caught in mid-air by Beast. He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them and Belle. They lunge at each other. One rips a hole in Beast's shoulder, and the others focus their attack on that spot. Finally, Beast throws a WOLF against a tree, knocking it out. The others turn and run in fear. Beast turns back to Belle, looks at her despairingly, then collapses. Belle, grateful to be alive, turns back to Phillipe and begins to get on, but her conscience takes over, and she walks over to the fallen Beast. Fade to Belle and Phillipe walking back to the castle, with Beast on the horse's back. Fade to interior of den, with Belle pouring hot water out of Mrs. Potts. She soaks a rag in the water, then turns to Beast, who is licking his wounds.)
(She touches the rag to the wound and Beast roars in pain. The Objects, who have been watching, jump back into hiding from the outburst.)
(Beast raises his hand to bring out another point, but finds he has none, so he bows his head down again. The Objects emerge from hiding as Belle has conquered the ferocious temper of Beast. Belle moves the rag closer to the wound)
(Beast gives a surprised grunt, then grits his teeth as the rag is applied. Belle speaks tenderly.)
(Beast opens his eyes, looking surprised.)
(Camera zooms out and we see the Objects looking on with interest. Fade to Gaston's tavern, which is empty except for Gaston, Lefou and Monsieur D'Arque, who are all sitting at a table.)
(Gaston pulls out a sack of gold and tosses it in front of him. He takes out a piece, scrapes it on his chin and continues.)
(Gaston slams a beer mug on his head.)
<br/>
(Gaston gives him another threatening look, and he ducks back under the mug.)
<br/>
(Cut to interior of Belle's cottage. Maurice is packing to leave.)
(Maurice leaves on his journey. Seconds later, Gaston and Lefou arrive with D'Arque. They enter the house looking for one of the residents.)

(Cut to Belle and Beast in background, with Objects including Chip in foreground watching them.)
(Objects walk away. Fade to breakfast table with Belle at one end and Beast at the other, with Mrs. Potts between them. Belle is served breakfast, and as she begins to eat, she looks at Beast, gobbling up his food with no table manners whatsoever. Chip laughs, but Mrs. Potts shoots him an admonishing look. Belle turns away and tries to ignore it, but Chip comes to the rescue. He nudges the spoon with his nose, and Beast reaches out for it (very 3-D-ishly). Belle looks at him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon, but he has little success. Finally, Belle puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast. Beast looks at the compromise and does the same. They both begin to sip their breakfast out of their bowls. Fade to courtyard where Belle and Beast are feeding the birds.)

(Belle is trying to attract some birds to Beast, who shoves a handful of seed at them. Finally, she takes a handful and gently spreads it out, creating a trail. One lands in his hands, and he looks up thrilled.)
(Belle has ducked around a tree, leaving Beast with the birds. She begins to look doubtful again, but turns her head around the tree and laughs. Beast is covered with birds.)
(Belle throws a snowball at Beast, who had looked at her proudly after the birds flew away. He begins to gather a large pile of snow. We cut to the Objects, looking out of a window at the two. In the background, Belle throws another snowball at Beast, who drops his huge pile of snow on his head. He chases her around a tree, but she ducks around the other side and sneaks up on him from behind.)
(Fade to den where Belle sits in front of a roaring fire and reads to Beast. Objects including Chip watch from doorway)
<i>Yes, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.</i>
<i>In a shack by the sea, I'll sit back, sipping tea</i>
<i>Let my early retirement commence</i>
<i>Far from fools made of wax, I'll get down to brass tacks and real-A-A-A-x!</i>
<i>[Transition to the library]</i>
(sung)
(Cut to interior of Beast's lair. He is in the tub getting washed up for the big night with Belle. Lumière is there with him.)
(Cut to shot of Beast in pig-tails and bows.)
(COATRACK begins to cut and chop again. Cogsworth enters.)
(Cut to grand staircase, where Belle descends from the West Wing side in a glittering gold ball gown. She reaches the landing and looks up at Beast, who is standing at the top of the stairs in his dress clothes. He is nudged on by Lumière from behind the curtain, and he descends and meets Belle at the landing. Arm in arm, they descend the last section of stairs and continue on their way to dinner, stopped momentarily by Sultan. Mrs. Potts sings from her cart with Chip on board.)
(Belle and Beast have moved into the ballroom, where they move through a computer perfect dance sequence. Beast occasionally looks over at Lumière and Cogsworth for their approval. Mrs. Potts and Chip are in the ballroom on their cart.)
(Chip slides off the end of the cart, and hops out of the room, but comes back for one last look. Belle and Beast have adjourned to the balcony under a starry night.)
(The pair adjourn to Beast's lair, where Beast hands Belle the magic mirror.)
(The magic mirror shines into life, and Belle turns her head away as it flashes. Then it reveals Maurice fallen in the woods, coughing and lost. Belle is shocked. Beast looks at her with concern.)
(Beast turns, then looks at the rose, deep in thought.)
(Belle turns to leave, then turns back and pushes the magic mirror back to Beast.)
(Belle turns to leave and Beast looks down in depression. She touches her hand to his cheek and rushes out. We see Belle's skirt fly past Cogsworth, who has entered the room.)
(Cut to Cogsworth telling the rest of the Objects about Beast's decision.)
(Cut to Beast watching Belle leave from above. He roars in sorrow and anger. His roar turns into the sound of the wind. Belle is out in the snow, calling out "Papa?" Finally, she finds him face down in a snowbank. They return home, where Lefou is still waiting, disguised as a snowman.)
(Cut to black. POV of Maurice as his eyes open. He sees Belle.)
(There is a sound coming from Belle's pack. The flap opens and the magic mirror falls out with Chip rolling to a stop on it.)
(Chip turns to Belle with a look of question on his face.)

(D'Arque waves his arms and ORDERLIES move in and pick up Maurice.)

(All the Objects spring into life, attacking their human enemies. Cut back to Belle's home, where Chip has readied the invention.)
(Maurice looks out from the window and sees the advancing axe.)
(The invention crashes into the door, and a red cloud of smoke poofs out of the basement. Belle and Maurice emerge from the wreckage to find Chip swinging on a loose spring.)
(Cut back to the castle where the attack continues. Meanwhile, Gaston has broken off from the Mob, and is searching out Beast. Belle, Maurice, Phillipe and Chip are making their way to the castle. Finally, the invaders are chased out and the Objects celebrate their victory.)
(Lumière pulls over Cogsworth and kisses him once on each cheek. Cogsworth shakes it off.)
(Cut to Gaston, who finds Beast's lair. He raises his crossbow and takes aim. Beast looks up at him, then looks back down in sadness again. Gaston releases the arrow and it strikes Beast in the shoulder. He screams in pain and stands. Gaston rushes him and they fly out the window onto the balcony, where it has begun to rain.)
(Gaston corners Beast on the edge of the roof. Beast simply sits there in despair.)
(Beast looks down ignoring him. Gaston walks into the foreground and breaks off a piece of the roof. He is about to smash it on Beast's head when Belle's voice drifts up. She is on the bridge and is yelling to Gaston, telling him to stop.)
(Gaston swings down at Beast, but he catches the weapon in his hand. Beast rises up and roars in Gaston's face. They proceed through a fight on the rooftop. Finally, Beast takes a hiding place among the gargoyles in the darkness. Meanwhile, Belle enters the castle on the ground.)
(Beast has been provoked enough. He emerges and they fight again.)
(This time, however, Beast picks up Gaston by the neck and holds him out over the edge of the roof. Gaston pleads with Beast.)
(Beast's anger slowly melts off his face, and the look of compassion returns. He pulls Gaston back onto the roof.)
(He shoves Gaston to the ground. Above, Belle comes out on a balcony.)
(Beast begins to climb the tower (very much like King Kong) until he reaches the balcony. He hangs over the side.)
(Beast and Belle stare passionately at each other, but the moment is interrupted when Gaston sneaks up and stabs Beast in the back. Beast roars in pain, and Belle is helpless. Gaston pulls the knife out and swings back for another shot. Beast starts to fall, knocking Gaston off his balance. Belle reaches forward and pulls Beast back, while Gaston falls off to his death. Belle helps the injured Beast up onto the balcony, where he lies down on the floor. The Objects come rushing out, but stay out of sight.)
(Belle pulls Beast's paw up to her cheek. He holds it there for a second, then drops it. His head falls back, and his eyes close. Belle drops the paw and puts her hands to her mouth. She can't believe this has happened.)
(Cut to Objects, who watch the last petal fall off the rose. They all look down at the floor, and Cogsworth puts his arm around Mrs. Potts. Cut back to Belle and Beast. The rain continues to fall. But one beam of light falls, like a shooting star. Then another comes. And another, and another. Belle finally notices what is happening. She stops crying for a second, then starts to back away. We cut away as a fog begins to enshroud Beast. We see the Objects looking on in extreme anticipation. Beast rises up into the air magically and begins to turn. He is enveloped in a cloud of light, and becomes wrapped in his cloak. Underneath, we can see Beast's body shifting and forming. A forepaw comes out and the claws turn into fingers. A hind paw emerges and develops into a foot. Finally, a wind blows across his face and the fur melts away to reveal a young prince. He gradually descends and is laid on the floor again. The fog disappears and Belle reaches out to touch him. She jerks her hand back, however, when the figure begins to move. It stands, then looks at its hands, then turns to face Belle. It is a human, with the same blue eyes as Beast. It is obviously Beast, transformed. Belle gives him a mysterious look.)
(She continues to look at him skeptically, but then she sees the blue eyes, and instantly knows it is him.)
(They kiss. A fireworks display explodes around them. The gloom surrounding the castle disappears, revealing a blue sky. The castle is transformed, with the gargoyles changing into cherubs. Finally, we return to the balcony, where the Objects hop out to meet Prince Adam and Belle. One by one, they are transformed back to their original human forms.)
(Chip comes riding in on Sultan.)
(Prince Adam picks up Belle and swings her around. The ruffles of her skirt wipe to the ballroom, where all are gathered to celebrate. Prince Adam and Belle dance around the room as the rest of the characters get in their last lines.)
(He takes off his glove and slaps Cogsworth across the face with it. They begin to fight. Cut to Belle and Prince Adam who continue to dance around the floor. The camera stops on Mrs. Potts, Chip and Maurice, who is beginning to cry.)
(Maurice laughs and Mrs. Potts hugs her child and laughs. Cut to a camera looking over the entire ballroom with all in the shot. It slowly zooms out with Belle and Prince Adam dancing around the room, and fades into the final stained glass window, this one with Belle and Prince Adam in the center, surrounded by the rest of the characters.)
(Fade out into credits. The end.)
(Now in the present. A young girl steps out of her house and walks down the path to the village.)
(Meanwhile, Belle continues her stroll downtown.)
(3 men are looking in window, then turning to watch her)
(Belle sits on the edge of a fountain, singing to the sheep and the washing
woman in the background, who leaves)
(<i>Geese flying overhead, one is shot and plummets to the ground. Lefou runs over, holds out the bag, and misses catching the prize. He returns to Gaston</i>)
(Belle walks by and away)
(Belle walks easily through the crowd of people in the town, Gaston struggles to catch up to her)
(Townsfolk gather around Gaston, and eventually surround him)
(<i>The Bimbettes, who are looking on, sigh.</i>)
(Gaston and Lefou laugh heartily)
(Explosion in background. Gaston and Lefou continue laughing. Belle rushes home and descends into the basement.)
(Fade to later in the day)
(Maurice and Phillipe continue on their journey until they become lost)
(Phillipe looks right, at a dark, overgrown path, then left towards a more inviting route, then begins to go left)
(Phillipe and Maurice continue through the dark.)
(A swarm of bats fly out of a tree. Phillipe runs through the forest avoiding everything until he almost runs over the edge of a cliff)
(He looks up and sees wolves growling at him. Maurice runs away, being chased by the wolves. He stumbles down a hill, and lands at the gate of a castle. He grabs the locked gate and tries to shake it open.)
(The gate opens, and Maurice runs in. He slams the gate in the faces of the wolves. Leaving his hat on the ground as the rain begins to fall, Maurice runs to the castle and bangs on the door. It creaks open and he enters, cautiously.)
(Watching from a table near the entrance are Lumière and Cogsworth)
(Cogsworth puts hand over Lumière's mouth, who promptly proceeds to touch his lit candle hand to Cogsworth's hand.)
(He picks up the candlestick for light, not realizing that the speaker is in his hand)
(Maurice sneezes in the face of Cogsworth, who proceeds to wipe his face off using his clock hands in a very anachronistic windshield wiper manner. Maurice sniffles, indicating the cold he has caught from being in the rain.)
(Lumière and Maurice head towards the den, with Cogsworth running after them.)
(Beast is watching the action from an overhead walkway, and rushes off as the trio enters the den.) 
(Cogsworth is run over by the (once again) anachronistic IndyCar sounding teacart of Mrs. Potts)
(The door to the den slams open and a strong gust of wind blows into the room, extinguishing Lumière's flames and the fire in the fireplace. Cogsworth dives for cover. Mrs. Potts begins to shake. Chip jumps back onto the tea cart and takes refuge from behind his mother)
(Beast enters. We see him in full for the first time. He is on all fours. He looks around in the darkness.)
(Lumière's last sentence is drowned out by the very loud growl of Beast, which puts out his flames once again. Lumière looks down, dejected.)
(Again, Beast's growl drowns out Cogsworth.)
(Maurice looks to one side of the chair, then to the other and sees Beast.)
(Beast picks up Maurice, carries him out of the room and slams the door, plunging the den, along with Cogsworth, Lumière,Mrs. Potts, and Chip into darkness. Fade out.)
(Fade in to Belle's cottage, seen from POV of Gaston and Lefou.)
(Gaston lets go of a branch, which swings back and hits Lefou in the mouth. Gaston turns to the band, wedding guests and others, apparently just out of sight of Belle's cottage.)
(MINISTER, BAKER, and OTHERS laugh heartily. Camera pans quickly to show Bimbettes crying their eyes out. To Lefou)
(Cut to interior of cottage. Belle is sitting in a chair reading her new book. There is a knock at the door. She puts the book down and walks to the door. She reaches up and pulls down a viewing device. She peeks through and sees an anachronistically accurate fish-eye view of Gaston. She moans, and pushes the door open.)
(She twists the knob and the door opens. Belle ducks under Gaston as he tumbles out the door and into the mud.)
(The wedding band begins to play "Here Comes the Bride." Gaston's boots are thrown out of the door (now opened inward) and the door is slammed shut. Lefou, who is directing the band, looks down and sees Gaston's legs sticking out of the mud, and Pierre's head sticking up. Lefou cuts off the band, and Gaston's head pops up, with the pig on top of him. He tilts his head, and the pig slides down his back.)
(Gaston walks off, dejected, and the focus returns to the cottage. Belle pokes her head out the door.)
(Belle walks into the pen and feeds the animals, then runs off singing into an open field overlooking a beautiful valley)
(Phillipe runs into the open field. Belle looks at him, disturbed that Maurice is not with him.)
(Belle unhitches the wagon from Phillipe.)
(Cut to exterior of the castle gate. (How Phillipe brought Belle there is a mystery, seeing as Phillipe never made it to the castle with Maurice.))
(Phillipe snorts, then begins to buck as if something is scaring him. Belle dismounts and comforts him.)
(Cut to interior of castle with Cogsworth and Lumière discussing events.)
(Cut back to door opening and Belle entering castle.)
(We follow as Belle ascends the grand staircase and searches for her father. Cut to kitchen where Mrs. Potts is standing next to a tub of hot water. Chip hops in.)
(Cut back to Lumière and Cogsworth bickering)
(Cogsworth and Lumière turn to look at the new arrival)
(Belle advances down a narrow hallway. Cogsworth and Lumière sneak up behind her and open the door that leads to the tower where Maurice is being kept. The door creaks open and Belle hears the sound)
(She begins up the stairs, but doesn't realize that Lumière is watching her.)
(Maurice's voice echoes from his cell)
(Suddenly, Beast grabs Belle's shoulder and whips her around. She drops the torch she was carrying into a puddle and the room is dark except for one beam of light from a skylight.)
(Belle ponders the situation and realizes she can't see the captor)
(Beast drags his legs, then his whole body into the beam of light. Belle looks, her eyes growing wider until she can stand no more and falls back to Maurice.)
(Belle regains her composure, then steps into the beam of light, giving her a very virgin-ish look)
(Beast moves over to unlock the cell, and Belle collapses to the floor with her head in her hands. We hear the door being unlocked, then Maurice rushing over to Belle.)
(Beast grabs him and drags him downstairs)
(Cut to exterior of castle. Beast drags Maurice towards Pallequin)
(The PALLENQUIN breaks the ivy holding it to the ground, then slinks off like a spider with Maurice inside)
(Cut to Belle looking out cell window at the PALLENQUIN crossing the bridge over the moat. She begins to cry. Cut to Beast walking up the stairs. Lumière is still at his post.)
(Beast enters the cell where Belle is still crying.)
(Beast leads Belle to her room. As they proceed, Belle begins to lag behind. She looks at the hideous sculptures on the walls and the light casting shadows on them. Frightened, she gasps and runs to catch up with Beast, who is carrying Lumière as a light source. Beast looks back at Belle, and sees a tear form at the corner of her eye.)
(Beast continues, and Belle reluctantly follows. Cut to interior of Belle's room dark. The door opens and light spills in.)
(Beast leaves, slamming the door behind him. Belle, terrified, runs over to the
bed and flings herself onto it, finally breaking down and crying.
(Fade to tavern in the town.)
(cheering from the gallery)
(Lefou turns chair back to forward)
(Lefou has pulled a man's belt off, whose pants fall to the ground. Lefou jumps up and wraps the belt around Gaston's neck, who flexes and breaks it off. Lefou continues to dance around. Cronies pick him up and swing him around.)
(Old cronies swing Lefou back and forth into the camera. Lefou tickles Gaston's chin, who stands with pride)
(Lefou swings up his arm in dance and throws a mug of beer in Gaston's face, who socks Lefou in the face)
(Gaston fights with the men, then lifts a bench with the Bimbettes on it. He drops the bench on Lefou, then turns to the camera and reveals his hairy chest.)
<b>ALL</b>: Ten points for Gaston!
(Gaston plays a chess game with a man, then hits the board, sending it and pieces all over. He takes a bite of leather from the belt once wrapped around his neck, chews it and spits it into a spittoon, which falls and gets stuck on the head of Lefou.)
(Gaston juggles a number of eggs, then swallows them whole. Lefou attempts the trick, and is hit in the face by three eggs.)
(Gaston takes three shots at a beer barrel, which begins leaking into the mugs of onlookers. He returns stomping to his chair, where we see the fireplace surrounded by the heads of the animals he has killed. The mystery cut of music is here! Cut to ending of "Gaston")
(The cronies have picked up the chair and carry Gaston around in it. Lefou tries to flee, but they toss the chair into its normal place, and Lefou is pinned underneath. Maurice bursts in frantically)
(Maurice has gone from person to person, pleading his case, until he is thrown at the feet of Gaston. A moment of silence, then the cronies begin to laugh and mock him.)
(The cronies pick up Maurice and help him out by throwing him through the door.)
(Lefou is still under the chair.)
(Gaston picks Lefou out from under the chair and holds his head close, and whispers)
(They begin a waltz around the floor as they sing)
(Camera zooms out through window to snow covered square, empty except for Maurice)
(Fade back to the bedroom of the castle where Belle is still crying. There is a 'clink clink clink' at the door. She gets up and walks over to open the door. Mrs. Potts enters with Chip and their entourage.)
(Belle bumps into the Wardrobe)
(Belle stands and the Wardrobe approaches her.)
(Cogsworth waddles in)
(Cut to Beast pacing back and forth in front of fire, with Mrs. Potts and Lumière looking on.)
(Lumière shrugs his shoulders and looks at Mrs. Potts.)
(Beast sits up, then straightens his face very formally)

(Beast puts his head in his hands as in a depressed state.)
(Fade out/Fade in to exterior of Belle's room. Door creaks open. Belle silently emerges. We see her feet go by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level. Behind it are Lumière and Featherduster.)
(Lumière and Featherduster have emerged and Lumière takes her in his arms. Suddenly he looks up and sees Belle walking down the hall. He drops Featherduster.)
(Cut to kitchen, where we find Cogsworth, Mrs. Potts, Chip and the STOVE.)
(A banging of pots and pans comes from the STOVE.)
(Belle enters, and Cogsworth cuts off Mrs. Potts before she can say 'spell.')
(Lumière comes running in.)
(He leans over to kiss her hand, but Lumière butts in front of him.)
(The fire on the STOVE roars to life, and drawers open to reveal silverwarestanding at attention.)
(Lumière has started out the swinging door. He lets it close, and the door hits Cogsworth and sends him across the room to land in a panfilled with (what looks like) pancake batter. He screams his line as he is in flight.)
(Cut to dining room, where Belle is seated at the end of a long table. Lumière is on the table and a spotlight shines on him.)
(The CHAIR has wrapped a napkin around the neck of Belle, who takes it off and places it on her lap. The CHAIR's arms put it's hands on it's 'waist' as if it were mad.)
(Lumière offers Belle a plate of hors d'oeuvres. She dips her finger in one, and tastes it.)
(A cabinet at the end of the table opens to reveal a large China collection, which rolls out and begins to perform. Lumière hands Belle a menu, which she begins to read.)
(plates of food go dancing by, with Cogsworth in the pudding. Lumière sets his torch to it, and it explodes, turning Cogsworth's face black with soot.)
(The FLATWARE enters a 'Busby Berkley-esque' swimming scene.)
(Lumière, standing on a plate, is elevated and begins to juggle his candles. Mugs enter the shot.)
(The Mugs begin a gymnastics routine, hopping over one another and passing a beverage from one to the next)
(ALL leave except Cogsworth, who looks scared, then begins to inch away. Lumière enters and holds him there.)
(Lumière sings as if he were reminiscing. Snow begins to fall. Cogsworth looks
up and sees the salt and pepper shakers doing their thing.)
(Lumière dusts the salt of the head of Cogsworth, who tries to escape. He tripsand falls into the gelatin mold.)
(Lumière jumps on a spoon in the gelatin, which catapults Cogsworth out of the mold. Cut to kitchen, where Mrs. Potts is surrounded by soap bubbles.)
(Mrs. Potts continues to dance around the kitchen)
(Mrs. Potts is cleaned off by a napkin. She hops onto the tea cart and rolls into the dining room, where she offers tea to Belle.)
(The China and candlesticks perform an elaborately choreographed dance sequence, ending in a closeup of Lumière.)
(A fantastic ending comes of the song, with SILVERWARE flying through the air, plates and Featherdusters dancing, and Cogsworth the focus of attention, until Lumière comes sliding in and sends him flying out of camera range.)
(Lumière comes up next to Cogsworth.)
(He tries to cover it up, just as a fork runs past. To Lumière)
(Cogsworth and Lumière have been fighting. They both look at her, then stop. Cogsworth dusts himself off, and Lumière fixes his wax nose.)
(Fade to Cogsworth, Lumière, and Belle walking down a hall with Sultan. Cogsworth is lecturing.)
(He turns to find the heads of the suits of armor have turned to follow Belle.)
(They all snap back to face forward.)
(Cogsworth turns back to the group and is one girl short. He sees her beginning to climb the grand staircase. He and Lumière run up to her and jump in front of her, blocking her progress upstairs.)
(Lumière has been shaking his head, but Cogsworth nudges him and he nods in agreement.)
(She steps over them, but they dash up and block her again.)
(Lumière and Cogsworth begin marching off, and Belle begins to follow, but her curiosity overtakes her, and she turns back to the West Wing. Her excitement begins to dwindle, though, when she enters the hallway leading to Beast's lair. As she walks down the hall, she stops to look in a mirror that has been shattered into several pieces, each one reflecting her concerned look. She reaches the end of the hall and finds a closed door with gargoyle handles. She takes a deep breath, then reaches out and opens the door. Cut to interior of lair, where Belle begins to explore. She is truly shocked by everything she sees. She wanders around, looking, and knocks over a table, but she catches it before it crashes to the floor. She then turns her head and sees a shredded picture on the wall. We can only see part of a portrait. It is the same portrait that was shredded in the opening. Belle reaches out and lifts the shreds of the picture to reveal the prince. We never see this, however, for then she turns her head and sees the rose under the bell jar. She walks over to it, her eyes transfixed. She reaches out, then lifts off the jar, leaving the rose unprotected. She reaches up, brushes back the strand of hair that has been repeatedly falling on her forehead, then reaches out to touch the rose. As she nears it, a shadow falls over her. Beast has been on the balcony, and sees her. He jumps back into the room, then slams the jar back on the rose. He then turns his attention to Belle.)
(Belle turns and flees the room. Beast calms down, then falls into despair, finally realizing that he may have destroyed his chances with Belle. She reaches the stairway and grabs her cloak. She rushes down the stairs, wrapping the cloak around her and bursting past a confused Lumière and Cogsworth .)
(Lumière tries to respond, but Belle slams the door behind her. He and Cogsworth both bow their heads in sadness. Cut to Belle outside in the forest on Phillipe. She begins to ride through the forest, but Phillipe comes to a stop. She looks up and sees the wolves. She gasps, then pulls the reins and begins to flee. She runs from side to side, making the wolves hit the trees (a la Speederbike chase in Return of the Jedi). Phillipe runs out on a frozen pond, but his and Belle's weight collapse the ice. The wolves chase her into the water. Some begin to drown, but Phillipe is able to get out of the water before anything serious happens. He runs into a clearing, but becomes surrounded by wolves. He bucks, throwing Belle off and wrapping the reins around a tree branch. The wolves begin their attack on Phillipe, but Belle comes to his rescue and beats them away with a stick. One WOLF grabs the stick in its mouth and breaks half of it off, leaving Belle defenseless. Another leaps at her, grabbing the corner of her cloak and dragging her to the ground. She looks up and sees a WOLF about to jump on top of her. It leaps and is caught in mid-air by Beast. He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them and Belle. They lunge at each other. One rips a hole in Beast's shoulder, and the others focus their attack on that spot. Finally, Beast throws a WOLF against a tree, knocking it out. The others turn and run in fear. Beast turns back to Belle, looks at her despairingly, then collapses. Belle, grateful to be alive, turns back to Phillipe and begins to get on, but her conscience takes over, and she walks over to the fallen Beast. Fade to Belle and Phillipe walking back to the castle, with Beast on the horse's back. Fade to interior of den, with Belle pouring hot water out of Mrs. Potts. She soaks a rag in the water, then turns to Beast, who is licking his wounds.)
(She touches the rag to the wound and Beast roars in pain. The Objects, who have been watching, jump back into hiding from the outburst.)
(Beast raises his hand to bring out another point, but finds he has none, so he bows his head down again. The Objects emerge from hiding as Belle has conquered the ferocious temper of Beast. Belle moves the rag closer to the wound)
(Beast gives a surprised grunt, then grits his teeth as the rag is applied. Belle speaks tenderly.)
(Beast opens his eyes, looking surprised.)
(Camera zooms out and we see the Objects looking on with interest. Fade to Gaston's tavern, which is empty except for Gaston, Lefou and Monsieur D'Arque, who are all sitting at a table.)
(Gaston pulls out a sack of gold and tosses it in front of him. He takes out a piece, scrapes it on his chin and continues.)
(Gaston slams a beer mug on his head.)
<br/>
(Gaston gives him another threatening look, and he ducks back under the mug.)
<br/>
(Cut to interior of Belle's cottage. Maurice is packing to leave.)

(Objects walk away. Fade to breakfast table with Belle at one end and Beast at the other, with Mrs. Potts between them. Belle is served breakfast, and as she begins to eat, she looks at Beast, gobbling up his food with no table manners whatsoever. Chip laughs, but Mrs. Potts shoots him an admonishing look. Belle turns away and tries to ignore it, but Chip comes to the rescue. He nudges the spoon with his nose, and Beast reaches out for it (very 3-D-ishly). Belle looks at him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon, but he has little success. Finally, Belle puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast. Beast looks at the compromise and does the same. They both begin to sip their breakfast out of their bowls. Fade to courtyard where Belle and Beast are feeding the birds.)

(Belle is trying to attract some birds to Beast, who shoves a handful of seed at them. Finally, she takes a handful and gently spreads it out, creating a trail. One lands in his hands, and he looks up thrilled.)
(Belle has ducked around a tree, leaving Beast with the birds. She begins to look doubtful again, but turns her head around the tree and laughs. Beast is covered with birds.)
(Belle throws a snowball at Beast, who had looked at her proudly after the birds flew away. He begins to gather a large pile of snow. We cut to the Objects, looking out of a window at the two. In the background, Belle throws another snowball at Beast, who drops his huge pile of snow on his head. He chases her around a tree, but she ducks around the other side and sneaks up on him from behind.)
(Fade to den where Belle sits in front of a roaring fire and reads to Beast. Objects including Chip watch from doorway)
<i>Yes, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before.</i>
(Cut to interior of Beast's lair. He is in the tub getting washed up for the big night with Belle. Lumière is there with him.)
(Cut to shot of Beast in pig-tails and bows.)
(COATRACK begins to cut and chop again. Cogsworth enters.)
(Cut to grand staircase, where Belle descends from the West Wing side in a glittering gold ball gown. She reaches the landing and looks up at Beast, who is standing at the top of the stairs in his dress clothes. He is nudged on by Lumière from behind the curtain, and he descends and meets Belle at the landing. Arm in arm, they descend the last section of stairs and continue on their way to dinner, stopped momentarily by Sultan. Mrs. Potts sings from her cart with Chip on board.)
(Belle and Beast have moved into the ballroom, where they move through a computer perfect dance sequence. Beast occasionally looks over at Lumière and Cogsworth for their approval. Mrs. Potts and Chip are in the ballroom on their cart.)
(Chip slides off the end of the cart, and hops out of the room, but comes back for one last look. Belle and Beast have adjourned to the balcony under a starry night.)
(The pair adjourn to Beast's lair, where Beast hands Belle the magic mirror.)
(The magic mirror shines into life, and Belle turns her head away as it flashes. Then it reveals Maurice fallen in the woods, coughing and lost. Belle is shocked. Beast looks at her with concern.)
(Beast turns, then looks at the rose, deep in thought.)
(Belle turns to leave, then turns back and pushes the magic mirror back to Beast.)
(Belle turns to leave and Beast looks down in depression. She touches her hand to his cheek and rushes out. We see Belle's skirt fly past Cogsworth, who has entered the room.)
(Cut to Cogsworth telling the rest of the Objects about Beast's decision.)
(Cut to Beast watching Belle leave from above. He roars in sorrow and anger. His roar turns into the sound of the wind. Belle is out in the snow, calling out "Papa?" Finally, she finds him face down in a snowbank. They return home, where Lefou is still waiting, disguised as a snowman.)
(Cut to black. POV of Maurice as his eyes open. He sees Belle.)
(There is a sound coming from Belle's pack. The flap opens and the magic mirror falls out with Chip rolling to a stop on it.)
(Chip turns to Belle with a look of question on his face.)
(There is a knocking at the door. Belle opens it and Monsieur D'Arque stands on the porch.)
(He steps aside to show the Asylum D'Loons wagon behind him.)
(Maurice has emerged from the home.)
(D'Arque waves his arms and ORDERLIES move in and pick up Maurice.)

(Gaston leads the Mob through the town and out into the forest, where they start chopping trees in preparation for their assault on the castle.)
(Cut to interior of basement, where Belle is prying at the window with a stick.)
(We see Chip looking in through the window. He turns around, thinking, and then he sees Maurice's contraption with the axe on the end of it.)
(Sultan comes in barking. They rush over to the window expecting the return of Belle.)

(The Mob succeeds in breaking in, and finds a grand entrance filled with assorted pieces of furniture, teacups, candlesticks, Featherdusters and clocks. They tiptoe in, and Lefou unknowingly picks up Lumière. )
(All the Objects spring into life, attacking their human enemies. Cut back to Belle's home, where Chip has readied the invention.)
(Maurice looks out from the window and sees the advancing axe.)
(The invention crashes into the door, and a red cloud of smoke poofs out of the basement. Belle and Maurice emerge from the wreckage to find Chip swinging on a loose spring.)
(Cut back to the castle where the attack continues. Meanwhile, Gaston has broken off from the Mob, and is searching out Beast. Belle, Maurice, Phillipe and Chip are making their way to the castle. Finally, the invaders are chased out and the Objects celebrate their victory.)
(Lumière pulls over Cogsworth and kisses him once on each cheek. Cogsworth shakes it off.)
(Cut to Gaston, who finds Beast's lair. He raises his crossbow and takes aim. Beast looks up at him, then looks back down in sadness again. Gaston releases the arrow and it strikes Beast in the shoulder. He screams in pain and stands. Gaston rushes him and they fly out the window onto the balcony, where it has begun to rain.)
(Gaston corners Beast on the edge of the roof. Beast simply sits there in despair.)
(Beast looks down ignoring him. Gaston walks into the foreground and breaks off a piece of the roof. He is about to smash it on Beast's head when Belle's voice drifts up. She is on the bridge and is yelling to Gaston, telling him to stop.)
(Gaston swings down at Beast, but he catches the weapon in his hand. Beast rises up and roars in Gaston's face. They proceed through a fight on the rooftop. Finally, Beast takes a hiding place among the gargoyles in the darkness. Meanwhile, Belle enters the castle on the ground.)
(Beast has been provoked enough. He emerges and they fight again.)
(This time, however, Beast picks up Gaston by the neck and holds him out over the edge of the roof. Gaston pleads with Beast.)
(Beast's anger slowly melts off his face, and the look of compassion returns. He pulls Gaston back onto the roof.)
(He shoves Gaston to the ground. Above, Belle comes out on a balcony.)
(Beast begins to climb the tower (very much like King Kong) until he reaches the balcony. He hangs over the side.)
(Beast and Belle stare passionately at each other, but the moment is interrupted when Gaston sneaks up and stabs Beast in the back. Beast roars in pain, and Belle is helpless. Gaston pulls the knife out and swings back for another shot. Beast starts to fall, knocking Gaston off his balance. Belle reaches forward and pulls Beast back, while Gaston falls off to his death. Belle helps the injured Beast up onto the balcony, where he lies down on the floor. The Objects come rushing out, but stay out of sight.)
(Belle pulls Beast's paw up to her cheek. He holds it there for a second, then drops it. His head falls back, and his eyes close. Belle drops the paw and puts her hands to her mouth. She can't believe this has happened.)
(Cut to Objects, who watch the last petal fall off the rose. They all look down at the floor, and Cogsworth puts his arm around Mrs. Potts. Cut back to Belle and Beast. The rain continues to fall. But one beam of light falls, like a shooting star. Then another comes. And another, and another. Belle finally notices what is happening. She stops crying for a second, then starts to back away. We cut away as a fog begins to enshroud Beast. We see the Objects looking on in extreme anticipation. Beast rises up into the air magically and begins to turn. He is enveloped in a cloud of light, and becomes wrapped in his cloak. Underneath, we can see Beast's body shifting and forming. A forepaw comes out and the claws turn into fingers. A hind paw emerges and develops into a foot. Finally, a wind blows across his face and the fur melts away to reveal a young prince. He gradually descends and is laid on the floor again. The fog disappears and Belle reaches out to touch him. She jerks her hand back, however, when the figure begins to move. It stands, then looks at its hands, then turns to face Belle. It is a human, with the same blue eyes as Beast. It is obviously Beast, transformed. Belle gives him a mysterious look.)
(She continues to look at him skeptically, but then she sees the blue eyes, and instantly knows it is him.)
(They kiss. A fireworks display explodes around them. The gloom surrounding the castle disappears, revealing a blue sky. The castle is transformed, with the gargoyles changing into cherubs. Finally, we return to the balcony, where the Objects hop out to meet Prince Adam and Belle. One by one, they are transformed back to their original human forms.)
(Chip comes riding in on Sultan.)
(Prince Adam picks up Belle and swings her around. The ruffles of her skirt wipe to the ballroom, where all are gathered to celebrate. Prince Adam and Belle dance around the room as the rest of the characters get in their last lines.)
