[After the opening logos, we see a mysterious void, full of various colors and weird lines. On one of the lines are running America Chavez and Defender Stephen Strange, trying to do their best to escape a demon chasing them. Defender Strange turns to his opponent and casts a spell that freezes him temporarily.]
<b>America:</b> [in Spanish] Did it kill it?
<b>Defender Strange:</b> [in Spanish] No! We'll kill it with this!
[The camera pans over to a spinning pedestal, floating in the middle of the ether. A book, glowing with magic, rests on it]
<b>America:</b> The Book of Vishanti!
<b>Defender Strange:</b> We can't let it get your power. Get to the book.
<b>America:</b> How do we get across?
<b>Defender Strange:</b> Jump!
<b>Defender Strange:</b> It's too strong. I can't hold it.
[Defender Strange then starts taking America's powers away from her.]
<b>Defender Strange:</b> I'm so sorry. This is the only way.
<b>America:</b> What are you doing?!
<b>Defender Strange:</b>  We can't let that thing take your power. You can't control it. But I can.
<b>America:</b> But we're friends!
<b>Defender Strange:</b> I know. But in the grand calculus of the Multiverse, your sacrifice is worth more than your life.
[Defender Strange suddenly gets impaled through the chest by the demon. America starts running to get the Book of Vishanti, but the demon stops her from going any further. The demon then restrains America and lifts her up, who screams and opens up a star shaped portal. Defender Strange sees this and fires bolts to release the demon's grip on America, who falls through the portal. Defender Strange then falls into the portal as well, the camera spinning around as he does. A flash of white and the scene then cuts to present day Doctor Strange, who bolts awake and sits up in his bed, breathing hard and he puts his hands over his face to clear sweat off it. He runs his hands through his hair, looks around to calm himself down, then he sees his broken wrist watch, his face reflected into the watch face. Strange gets out of bed and picks up his watch. We then see Strange in formal clothing and walking to a mirror to sort out his tie. After he short cuffs it, he uses his magic to straighten it, then he snaps his fingers to retrieve the Cloak of Levitation, which goes into his front shirt pocket. After Strange has his jacket on and walks through the New York Sanctum, the scene cuts to a church.]
[Stephen sits down on a bench, waiting for the ceremony to begin. On his left he notices a familiar face. Doctor Nicodemus West, his former colleague and rival.]
<b>Doctor Nicodemus West:</b> Doctor Strange.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Doctor West.
<b>Doctor Nicodemus West:</b> Haven't seen you in a while.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I was a little preoccupied being dust in the air for five years.
<b>Doctor Nicodemus West:</b> So were a lot of us. While I was gone... thank you for asking... I lost both my cats. And my brother.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I'm very sorry.
<b>Doctor Nicodemus West:</b> Thank you. I, uh... I guess what keeps me up at night is wondering... Did it have to happen that way? Was there any other path?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> No. But I made the only play we had.
<b>Doctor Nicodomus West:</b> Of course, you do. The best surgeon and the best superhero. But you still didn't get the girl.
[camera pans over to Christine Palmer walking down the aisle as flower girls follow. Scene change.]
[We follow doctor strange as he walks in a rooftop bar. This is presumably the party after Doctor Christine Palmer’s wedding reception.]
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Glass of red, please? [to the bar tender.]
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Allow me, Miss.
[Doctor Strange uses his magic to change the water in Christine Palmer's glass into wine.]
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> A little too on the nose?
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> What, for you, at my wedding? Nah. It was perfect.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Congratulations.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Thank you. There's Charlie. I have to introduce you because he's kind of... It's embarrassing, but he's a big fan.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> So... Hey, uh, Christine... umm... I should have... I wish it had been different. I never stopped caring about us, but I had to make sacrifices. To protect you. I'm sorry.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> It was never gonna work out between us.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Why not?
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Because Stephen... You have to be the one holding the knife. And I always respected you for it, but I couldn't love you for it.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> How long have you had that one in the barrel?
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Long time.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah. I bet. Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> I am. I really, really am.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Good.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Are you?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I'm happy.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Good. You deserve it.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Thank you.
[ A giant green tentacle monster with a huge eye comes ramping down the street destroying everything in its path. Doctor strange takes his ascot out of his pocket and it turns into his cloak. As he floats down, his dress suit turns into his mystical robes. The same girl from Doctor Strange’s dream comes running down the street.]
<b>America:</b> Look out!
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Do I know you?
[He has a sudden flashback of the girl in his dream.]
<b>Wong:</b> Help! You're welcome. Do you know it's ancient custom to bow in the presence of the Sorcerer Supreme?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah. I'm aware of the customs. Hold it. Hold it.
<b>Charlie:</b> Woah! That's incredible.
<b>Doctor Christine Palmer:</b> Yeah.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Oh, god!
<b>Wong:</b> Who's this?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question. (grabbing her wrist) Hey, kid. What did that creature want with you?
<b>Wong:</b> Where are your parents?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Take her back to the Sanct... She took my slingy.  
<b>Wong:</b>She took your slingy. 
[the girl runs away but Wong and Strange catch up through a portal.]
We're not gonna k*ll you, kid. I just bust my ass trying to save your life, remember? Giant monsters, I can clearly handle. But what bothers me, is that last night, you were in my dream.
<b>America:</b> That wasn't a dream. It was another universe. 
<b>America:</b> How much experience do you guys have with the Multiverse?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> We have experience with the Multiverse. Most recently, there was an incident with Spider-Man...
<b>America:</b> With what Man?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Spider-Man. He has the powers of a spider.
<b>Wong:</b> Hence the name.
<b>America:</b> Gross. Does he look like a spider?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> No. More like a man.
<b>Wong:</b> Climbs walls, shoot webs.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah. Bingo.
<b>America:</b> Out his butt?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> No. Maybe. I don't know.
<b>Wong:</b> Ew.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Honestly, I hope not.
<b>America:</b> Super weird.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> You're gonna get a stomachache.
<b>America:</b> I'm from another universe. How do you know my stomach works the same as yours?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I don't. I don't even know if you're from another universe. Which is why I'm still sitting here waiting for you to enlighten us.
<b>America:</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> Frankly, of the two Doctor Stranges that I've met, you are not my favorite.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Which means?
<b>America:</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> He can't speak Spanish?
<b>Wong:</b> <i>[in Spanish]</i> I don't even know if he speaks his own language.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Look, I left a very nice wedding to save a smartness kid from getting eaten by an octopus. Tell me--
<b>Wong:</b> Whose wedding?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Christine's.
<b>Wong:</b> You went?
<b>America Chavez:</b> Holy shit. You married Christine?
<b>Passer-by:</b> Do you mind?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yes, I do. No, I didn't. Yes. You need to explain to me what's going on. Why was that octopus trying to eat you?
<b>America Chavez:</b> That thing was trying to kidnap me. It's like a henchman who works for a demon. All we knew is that they wanted to take my power for themselves.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> What power?
<b>America Chavez:</b> I can travel the Multiverse.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> What?
<b>Wong:</b> You can physically move from one universe to another?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> How?
America Chavez: That's the problem. I don't know how. I can't control it. Only happens when I'm really, really afraid.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Okay. Did the other me know how to defeat this demon?
America Chavez: Well, you just knew this magical book of pure good, that gives a sorcerer whatever they need to defeat their enemy.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> The Book of Vishanti? It's not real. It's a fairy tale that doesn't exist.
Wong: Actually, it does. I found out in the secret book you get when you become Sorcerer Supreme.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Unbelievable.
America Chavez: You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> No, I am not the Sorcerer Supreme.
America: Other you was Sorcerer Supreme in his universe.
Wong: Although it does exist, the Book of Vishanti is said to be unreachable.
America: It is, except... we reached it. Then the demon caught up with us. I thought you'd protect me, but... You didn't.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> That was the fight in my dream.
America: That wasn't a dream.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Prove it. It wasn't a dream. That means... Dreams are windows into the lives of our Multiversal selves.
America: That was his theory.
Wong: So that recurring nightmare where I'm running naked from a clown...
America Chavez: Somewhere out there, it's real.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Somewhere out there, I had a ponytail.
Wong: There could be more creatures coming for her.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> That power is dangerous enough in the hands of a kid. Imagine if a real threat acquired it.
Wong: It occurs to me, young one, we don't know your name.
America Chavez: America Chavez.
Wong: Miss Chavez, will you come with us to Kamar-Taj? You'll be safe there.
America Chavez: How do I know you won't betray me like he did?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I guess you're just gonna have to trust me.
Wong: What do we do with him? That's gotta violate an ordinance.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I've buried worse.
( he says while burying the dead strange.)
Wong: The creature that killed him, did... did it have the same markings as the octopus?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Runes.
Wong: This isn't sorcery.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> It's witchcraft.
Wong: Do we know anyone who's faced such a thing?
[The WandaVision episode 2 motif picks up in the background]
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I think I might.
Billy and Tommy: Chocolate!
Wanda 2: Hey! What did I say?
Billy and Tommy: But we can't wait.
Wanda 2: Well what did I say? Go wash your hands.
Tommy: Mom, come on. I'm too old for that.
Wanda 2: Okay.
Billy: You can tuck me in, Mom.
Wanda 2: I will. You know... A family is forever. We could never truly leave each other even if we tried.
Tommy: Mom, I changed my mind. You can come tuck me in if you want.
Wanda 2: Okay. Love you.
Strange: Apples, right?
Wanda: Eventually.
Strange: Smells...
Wanda: Sweet. 
I was gonna say real. 
It's all very real. Thanks. I put the magic behind me.
Strange: So I can see.
Wanda: Well, I knew sooner or later you'd... show up, wanting to discuss what happened at WestView. I made mistakes, and people were hurt.
Strange: But you put things right in the end and that was never in doubt. I'm not here to talk about WestView.
Wanda: Then what are you here for?
Strange: We need your help.
Wanda: With what?
Strange: What do you know about the Multiverse?
Wanda: The Multiverse. Vis had his theories. He believed it was real. And, dangerous.
Strange: Well, he was right about both. We found a girl who can somehow travel across it but she's being pursued.
Wanda: Pursued by who?
Strange: Some kind of demon. One that covets her power for itself. Now we've taken her to Kamar-Taj, and... We've got our defenses, but... We could use an Avenger.
Wanda: There are other Avengers.
Strange: Yeah, but given a choice between the Archer with a mohawk, and several bug-themed crimefighters, or... One of the most powerful magic wielders on the planet, it's an easy call. Come to Kamar-Taj. It'll get you back on a lunch box.
Wanda: What if you brought America here?
Strange: Here?
Wanda: Yeah. I know what it's like. To be on your own, hunted for abilities you never wanted. I can protect her. 
Wanda: You never told me her name, did you?
Strange: No. No, I didn't.
Wanda: You know, the Hex was the easy part. The lying, not so much.
(She conjures a barrier to that reveals the real farm she was living on)
Strange: The Darkhold.
Wanda: You've heard of the Darkhold?
Strange: I know it's the Book of the Damned. And that it corrupts everything and everyone that it touches. I wonder what it's done to you.
Wanda: The Darkhold only showed me the truth. Everything I lost... can be mine again.
Strange: What do you want with America? What do you want with the Multiverse?
Wanda: I'm going to leave this reality, and go to one where I can be with my children.
Strange: Wanda, your children aren't real. You created them using magic.
Wanda: That's what every mother does. If you knew... there was a universe, where you were happy, wouldn't you wanna go there?
Strange: I am happy.
Wanda: I know better than most what self-deception looks like.
Strange: What you're doing is a flagrant violation of every natural law. If you take that child's power, she won't survive.
Wanda: I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen. But she's not a child. She's a supernatural being. Such raw power could wreak havoc on this, and other worlds. Her sacrifice would be for the greater good.
Strange: Well you can kiss the lunchbox goodbye because that's the kind of justification our enemies use.
Wanda: Is it the one you use? When you gave Thanos the Time Stone?
Strange: That was war, and I did what I had to do.
Wanda: You break the rules and become a hero. I do it and I become the enemy. That doesn't seem fair.
Strange: What happens now?
Wanda: Return to Kamar-Taj, and prepare to hand over America Chavez by sundown. Peacefully. After that... You'll never see me again.
Strange: And if we don't?
Wanda: Then it won't be Wanda who comes for her. It will be the Scarlet Witch.
Wong: Scarlet Witch.
Wanda's gone. She's got the Darkhold and the Darkhold has her.
Wong: Scarlet Witch is a being of unfathomable magic. She can rewrite reality as she chooses, and is prophesized to either rule, or annihilate the cosmos.
Strange: She took over a whole town using her mind. If she gets America's power... she could enslave the entire Multiverse.
America: So the person you went to ask for help, and told exactly where I am, is the person that's trying to kill me?
Strange: Yeah.
Wong: Suspend teaching at once. And arm the students. Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.
Rintrah: That's the Masters of the Hong Kong and London Sanctum.
Master of Hong Kong Sanctum: Honored to face death again by your side.
Wong: The honor is ours.
Master of London Sanctum: Whatever the Sorcerer Supreme asks of us, it shall be done.
Wong: It's ancient custom. Choose your words wisely. The fate of the Multiverse may depend on it.
Strange: Got it. No pressure, then.
Wanda: All this for a child you met yesterday?
Strange: Wanda, you are justifiably angry. You had to make terrible sacrifices.
Wanda: I blew a hole through the head of the man I loved... and it meant nothing. Do not speak to me of sacrifice, Stephen Strange. If you give me what I want... I'll send you to a world where you can be with Christine.
Strange: The full might of Kamar-Taj stands against you.
Wong: Defensive positions. Now!
Strange: Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.
Wanda: You have... no idea just how reasonable I have been.
Strange: Yeah. Book of the Damned, calling yourself a Witch, conjuring creatures to abduct a kid... I don't exactly call that being reasonable.
Wanda: Sending those creatures after her instead of myself was mercy. And in spite of your hypocrisies... and insults, I have begged you to safely get out of my way. You have exhausted my patience. But I do hope you understand... that even now... what's about to happen... This is me, being... reasonable.
Wong: Hold! Hold!
Strange: Nailed it.
Wong: Reinforce the shield!
Strange: She's trying to get in their heads.
Wong: Sorcerers! Fortify your mind!
Wanda: Run...
Wong: The shield is down!
Sara: Fire!
Wong: Yes!
Sara: Take cover!
Wong: Fire at will!
Strange: Fall back! Wong!
Wong: Get out of here!
Strange: You want the girl, you're gonna have to go through me.
Wanda: Fine.
Strange: We gotta get you out of here. Now.
America: Why? What happened?
Wong: Kamar-Taj has fallen.
Strange: Reflections. She's using the reflections.
Wong: Cover them!
Wanda: You gave all those lives just to keep me from my children.
Strange: You took those lives. You cannot be allowed to cross into the Multiverse.
Wanda: I'm not a monster, Stephen. I'm a mother.
Strange: Wanda, you have no children. They don't exist.
Wanda: But they do. In every other universe. I know they do. Because I dream of them... Every... night. Of my boys... Of our life together. Every night, the same dream. And every morning... the same... nightmare.
Strange: What if you reach them? What happens to the other you? What happens to their mother?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> You okay?
<b>America Chavez:</b> You saved me.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> I hope so.
[Doctor Strange and America Chavez stand up and observe their surroundings from the rooftop.]
<b>America Chavez:</b> Surprised you didn't puke.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> That's not my first weird trip, kid. So. This is New York in the Multiver...
[Doctor Strange is quickly proven wrong when he runs to a nearby chimney and pukes into it, the chimney stack covering up what Strange is puking.]
<b>America Chavez:</b> There it is.
[America Chavez watches Doctor Strange puke two more times before he recovers.]
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Crap. [The Cloak of Levitation wipes Strange's mouth.] Cut it out.
[Doctor Strange takes the Cloak off and examines it. It has a nasty gash on it.]
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah. You got pretty dinged up. [Doctor Strange puts the Cloak back on him.] We'll get you fixed. All right, America. You've gotta open a portal to get us back there right now.
<b>America Chavez:</b> I don't know how.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> You just did it.
<b>America Chavez:</b> Not on purpose.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Wong is back there alone with Wanda and I'm the only hope he has.
<b>America Chavez:</b> I can't control my powers...
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> You must be able to control it somehow. Even I could... [Doctor Strange sees America Chavez shrink back, and realises that he is bringing up bad memories of Defender Strange.] Sorry. Well, what about this universe's version of you? Maybe she can control her powers.
<b>America Chavez:</b> This universe doesn't have a me.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> What?
<b>America Chavez:</b> None of them do.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> But how do you know that?
<b>America Chavez:</b> Because I've looked. And... because I never dream.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> It's okay, kid. Even if you could get me back there, I have no way of fighting Wanda.
<b>America Chavez:</b> What about the Book of Vishanti?
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> What about it?
<b>America Chavez:</b> Other you thought it could stop whoever was after me.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Yeah, well, good for other me. He's not here, is he? I don't know where it is. So unless there's another other me...
<b>America Chavez:</b> We need to go find...
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Other "other me".
Strange: They go on red?
America: Rule number one of Multiversal travel? You don't know anything.
Strange: Right. It's red. So, what's rule number two? America? America?
America: Rule number two? Find food. Preferrably, pizza. Pizza balls.
Strange: How'd you pay for that?
America: It was free. Food's free in most universes, actually. It's weird you guys have to pay for it.
Pizza Poppa: Hey. You didn't pay for that.
America: Crap. Maybe it's not free here.
Pizza Poppa: Pizza Poppa always gets paid.
Strange: Alright, Pizza Poppa. Relax, she's just a kid...
Pizza Poppa: Relax yourself there, Doctor Strange. Where did you get this cape from anyway? Oh, that feels authentic.
Strange: It's not a cape, it's a cloak. And I suggest you let go.
Pizza Poppa: You took this whole suit from the Strange Museum, didn't ya?
Strange: Strange Museum?
Pizza Poppa: You're a taker. Why don't you take some mustard, huh?!
Strange: Come on. It's not permanent.
America: Is it gonna stop in a few minutes?
Strange: About three weeks. Those universes we went through, were we paint in one of them?
America: Yeah. You don't wanna get stuck in there. It's really hard to eat.
Strange: How many universes have you been through?
America: Seventy-two? Seventy-three, counting this one.
Strange: That's... That's a lot.
Automatic Voice: Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you don't forget.
Christine: This is pretty fancy. Sure you didn't have to take out another student loan?
Strange: Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys that we operated on last week.
Christine: So, I got you a little something... Congratulations.
Strange: What is it?
Christine: Open it and see.
Strange: Christine, this is... This is amazing. Thank you. We don't have time for this.
Automatic Voice: Memory Lane. Replay your significant memories, now in a discounted price. We remember, so you don't forget.
Strange: Where's this?
America: Home. My moms. Yeah, you're right. This is just a waste of time.
Strange: Hey, kid. That was the first time that you opened a portal, right?
America: It doesn't matter.
Strange: It does matter. You lost your parents.
America: I didn't lose them. I killed them.
Strange: No. No, you did not. Don't even think that.
America: Okay, I opened a portal with the powers I can't control, and sent them to a random, probably deadly universe with no way to escape.
Strange: Listen, if your moms are anything like their daughter... They survived. I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.
America: Not bad.
Strange: Thanks.
America: That woman, in your Memory Lane thing, that was Christine, right?
Strange: Yes, that was Christine. How do you know her?
America: From other you.
Strange: Were we together?
America: No, you didn't talk anymore. You blew it.
Strange: Of course.
America: Did you blow it with your Christine?
Strange: Yes, I guess I did.
America: Why?
Strange: Complicated.
America: More complicated than being chased by a witch through the Multiverse?
Strange: Yes, actually. It is.
America: "Gave his life defeating Thanos?"
Strange: Yeah, see? We're not all bad.
America: If other you's dead... Who's master of the Sanctum?
Strange: Oh, shit.
America: You know him?
Strange: Yeah. Mordo. He's actually the first guy who let me into Kamar-Taj.
America: Oh, great.
Strange: And then he snapped and dedicated his life trying to k*ll me.
America: Oh... Great.
Mordo: I always suspected this day would come.
Strange: You did?
Mordo: Yes. Because you always suspected this day would come. My brother.
Strange: All right.
Mordo: Come, and tell me everything... About your universe.
Strange: We go on red.
Mordo: You're quite formidable too, it seems. A multiversal traveler. But thank the stars you brought Doctor Strange to safety.
Strange: Well, just 'cause we jumped ship, doesn't mean we're safe. Our Wanda has the ability to conjure demons and monsters to attack America - in other universes.
Mordo: So she has the Darkhold?
Strange: Oh, you know of the Darkhold?
Mordo: Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold in this universe, too. I got it here in this Sanctum. We would never risk a weapon that dangerous falling into the wrong hands.
Strange: Damn right.
Mordo: If your Darkhold is anything like ours, I'm afraid she can do far worse than just summon monsters, to come after you.
America: What do you mean?
Mordo: There is a spell contained within those pages. Corrosive to the soul. A desecration of reality itself. Dreamwalking. A dreamwalking sorcerer projects their own consciousness from their universe into another. Possessing the body of an alternate self. Playing puppeteer, this unholy doppelganger, and pursue their enemies from afar. The possession is not a permanent link between realities, but in the fleeting time they dreamwalk, they can do irreparable damage to the universe they invade. So it may not be a demon that you face. It may be, the Scarlet Witch.
America: But, why didn't she do that to begin with?
Strange: Because that was her being reasonable. What do you know of the Book of Vishanti?
Mordo: The Darkhold's antithesis. It can give a sorcerer whatever power they need to vanquish their enemy.
Strange: I need to...
Mordo: I'm sorry, Stephen. But I hope you, of all people, understand... That it is not Wanda Maximoff who threatens our reality. It's the two of you.
Strange: What was in that tea? You son of a b... Sands of Nisanti.
Mordo: I only acted, as you would.
Strange: She is coming. You got me.
Wanda 2: Boys, it's time for bed.
Billy and Tommy: Can we have one more ice cream? - Please, please... - Please! - You know who's best?
Wanda 2: Who?
Billy and Tommy: 2003 Tigers.
Billy: Mom?
Wanda: Yes, sweetheart?
Billy: Where are you going?
Wanda: Just... to take out the trash.
Billy: Can we show you something? Mom, hurry. Come on! Come on, it's important.
Tommy: Mom! You'll like it. Come on. Hurry up. It's important.
Billy: Okay, so... Listen to this.
Tommy: I'm gonna start it.
Billy: No, I wanna start it.
Tommy: I wanna start it!
Billy: No, I wanna start!
Wanda: Why don't you both... start it... whatever... it is, together?
Tommy: Okay.
Billy: Okay. You ready?
Tommy: Yeah.
Billy and Tommy: Three, two, one, go. We like ice cream like every child should... And if we get some ice cream, we promise to be good!
Sara: You're alive. Yes. But so many others were lost.
Wong: Set me free. I need to destroy the book.
Sara: No. It cannot be you.
Wong: No!
Billy: Mom! What happened? Are you okay?
Wanda: Billy. Tommy. No. No. I need the Darkhold spells. You are the Sorcerer Supreme. Tell me what you know.
Wong: You'll have to kill me, witch.
Wanda: Not you. Them.
Wong: Wanda, stop. Wanda, please. The Darkhold was a copy!
Wanda: A copy?
Wong: Legend speaks of a mountain with the wretched spells you seek carved into its walls. It's there the Darkhold was transcribed. Mount Wundagore.
Wanda: Wundagore?
Wong: No one has survived the journey.
Wanda: Perhaps we will be the exception.
America: Hey. Hey! This universe sucks!
Strange: Cloak? Hey. Hey, Labcoat. Where the hell are we? Look, I don't know who you are or what you think you're trying to do here, but... These situations don't usually work out well for a nameless scientist, so just... Christine?
Christine 2: Hello, Stephen.
America: Ay, Dios.
Christine 2: Miss Chavez. To answer your question, you're in a highly secure research facility. The two of you, along with your sentient cloak, are here for surveillance and testing.
Strange: Testing?
Christine 2: Well, yes. You're visitors from another universe. Your magnetic signatures could be radioactive. You may be carying diseases we just don't have treatments for. Hence these amazing polycarbonate fishbowls.
Strange: Right. So, I have you to thank for these then.
Christine 2: Yes, I developed those using the Sands of Nisanti. One of Stephen's magical relics.
Strange: Stephen. Is that some kinda cyborg me?
Christine 2: Our universe is 838. And we've designated yours 616.
Strange: Oh. You guys sure must know a lot about the Multiverse. You got someone going around naming realities.
Christine 2: Yes. Me. My senior phoned the Baxter Foundation, and I specialize in Multiversal research.
Strange: So, how'd you end up working here? Wherever here is.
Christine 2: Oh, I volunteered. At your funeral.
Strange: Thank you for going.
Christine 2: Your injuries, they're... They're similar, but they're not identical. It's fascinating.
Strange: What were we, to each other in this universe?
Christine 2: We never quite figured that out.
Strange: Yeah. That's something we got in common. Christine... You gotta let us out of here. Everyone's in real danger. Look, I know you don't know me...
Christine 2: And I don't want to. Whatever I was to you, in your universe, does not matter.
Strange: Why not?
Christine 2: Because you're dangerous, Stephen.
Strange: Someone from my universe wants that girl. And she's gonna rip this place apart, atom by atom, until she gets what she wants. So I don't care, if you're from the Avengers, or S.H.I.E.L.D...
Mordo: We're neither.
Strange: Well, what then? Hydra?
Mordo: The Illuminati, will see you now.
Strange: The Illumi-whati? Don't let anyone hurt the kid. It's gonna be okay.
Wanda: You couldn't portal us up there?
Wong: My magic can only take us so far. Masters of the Mystic Arts weren't meant to tread upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore. Eons ago... The first demon, Chthon, carved his dark magic into this tomb. These same spells, were later transcribed into the Darkhold. There's no telling what soulless monstrosities lie within.
Wanda: They've been waiting for me. This isn't a tomb. It's a throne.
(Doctor Strange is led through a huge room by the robots)
Mordo: Stephen Strange... You are now called before the Illuminati. I, Baron Karl Mordo, The Sorcerer Supreme, hereby...
Strange: Karl?
Mordo: Captain Carter. The First Avenger. Blackagar Boltagon. Keeper of the Terrigen Mists. The Inhuman King.
Strange: Blackagar Boltagar? Hey-the-guy, hey-the-there.
Mordo: Captain Marvel. Defender of the Cosmos. And the smartest man alive, Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.
Reed: Hello, Stephen.
Strange: Fantastic Four? Didn't you guys chart in the sixties?
Maria: I'm sorry. Is this a joke to you?
Strange: Well there's a guy over there with a fork on his head, so, yeah. Little bit.
Carter: Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't engage you in conversation.
Strange: Why? Does he have bad breath?
Carter: This Strange is even more arrogant than ours.
Strange: No. Just more alive.
Maria: For now.
Reed: Stephen, your arrival here confuses and destabilizes reality. The larger the footprint you leave behind, the greater the risk of an incursion.
Strange: Incursion?
Reed: An incusion occurs, when the boundary between two universes erodes, and they collide. Destroying one, or both, entirely.
Carter: Your alternate self created the Illuminati, to make difficult decisions that no one else could. Today, we're here to determine what to do with you, and the child.
Maria: So, before we vote, if you got anything serious to say, now's the time.
Strange: Yeah, I do. It's incursions you're worried about. Do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat than the Scarlet Witch?
Maria: Oh, we can handle your little witch if she decides to dreamwalk.
Strange: No. No, you cannot, not unless you give me the Book of Vishanti.
Reed: We appreciate your concern, Stephen, but it's not the Scarlet Witch that we fear. From our experience, the greatest danger to the Multiverse, it turns out... is Doctor Strange.
Strange: Your Doctor Strange? Earth's Mightiest Hero who died defeating Thanos?
Xavier: We should tell him the truth.
Mordo: Our final member... Professor Charles Xavier.
Strange: What truth?
Xavier: That's not how our Strange died.
Wanda: You're wondering what happens now.
Wong: No. That I had already accepted. But I do wonder... When you can force America to send you to any universe you want, Why take her power for your own? You know it will k*ll her.
Wanda: For Billy and Tommy. To protect them. What if they get sick? In the infinite Multiverse, there's a cure for every illness. A solution to every problem. I won't lose them again.
Wong: Try as you might, Wanda, you cannot control everything.
Wanda: I can. Look at that view. It's carved in stone. I was meant to rule everything. But that's not what I want. I just want my boys.
Wong: At the cost of a child's life! Is there no peace in knowing that, even though you can't be with the ones you love, there are worlds where you are together. Is that not enough?
Wanda: No.
Xavier: Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos. We were at w*r. While the rest of us banded together to try to stop Thanos, Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.
Mordo: He turned to the Darkhold. Began dreamwalking. In hopes that our salvation might lie in the Multiverse.
Maria: And guess what? It didn't. But he kept doing it anyway.
Reed: One day, you called us all together, to profess that you've been dreamwalking. And in your words, "things have gotten out of hand." You never told us the details of what had happened. Only that you had inadvertently triggered an incursion. You, our friend, had caused the annihilation of another universe.
Maria: Everyone in that reality died. Everyone.
Xavier: Stephen renounced the Darkhold. He even helped us find the Book of Vishanti. A weapon we did use to k*ll him, to defeat Thanos. Thus, one final threat remained. I shall miss you, my friend.
Strange: I'm ready.
Black Bolt: I'm sorry.
Strange: Did you tell Christine?
Reed: Yes.
Strange: That statue... what about the statue? You built a statue.
Carter: The world needs heroes. We made a difficult choice because we knew what our Strange was capable of. Or perhaps, every Doctor Strange is capable of.
Reed: The building's been breached.
Strange: No shit, genius.
Carter: Status report, all sentries.
Maria: She's headed for the child.
Carter: Watch him. We'll vote on our return.
Xavier: Stephen, should you manage to escape this chamber, you must guide America Chavez.
Mordo: What the hell are you saying?
Xavier: Save the girl, and get to the Book of Vishanti.
Strange: What, you have the book here?
Xavier: Yes. You built a way point.
Mordo: Charles. We cannot trust him.
Xavier: I believe we can. Just 'cause someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they're lost forever. We will see what kind of Doctor Strange you are.
Strange: Thank you.
Christine 2: Everybody out.
America: It's Wanda.
Automatic Voice: Ultron commander... Ultron command...
America: Hurry up, Doc, she's coming.
Christine 2: Oh, no.
Reed: Wanda, stop. You possessed an innocent woman, but you can still do the right thing. Let her go. Please. I have children of my own. I understand your pain.
Wanda: Is their mother still alive?
Reed: Yes.
Wanda: Good. There will be someone left to raise them.
Reed: Wanda... Black Bolt can destroy you with one whisper from his mouth.
Wanda: What mouth?
Strange: Take me to the Book of Vishanti so that we can fight her together.
Mordo: You are in no position to give orders. My vote will conclude these proceedings when they return.
Wanda: Haven't you had enough?
Carter: I can do this all day.
Maria: Get the hell out of my universe!
Strange: They're not coming back. And you just cast your vote now to kill your friends. Not that that ever bothered you before. You know, you hated me where I came from. I bet secretly, "my brother", you hated me here. You must've been so jealous. Do you know what? I bet you were thrilled when you heard I've been corrupted, hell, you probably gave me the Darkhold to begin with.
Mordo: You know nothing, of this universe!
Strange: I know, that killing Stephen Strange was your ticket to getting the Sanctum, to becoming Sorcerer Supreme, and to joining your little circus of clowns, the Illuminati.
Mordo: I'm ready! To cast my vote. Now.. Die! I think I'm beginning to understand, why your Mordo, didn't like you very much!
Christine 2: You're sealed shut! Get back.
America: Whoa. 
Xavier: Enough! 
Wanda 2: Help me. Please... 
Xavier: Wanda Maximoff... Your mind is being held hostage by your alternate self. Grab my hand. If I can pull you from under the rubble, the spell should break. 
Strange: Hey. You all right? You okay? You all right? Yeah. 
America: She fixed him. 
Strange: Thank you. 
Christine 2: Yeah. 
Strange: Xavier said I built a waypoint to the Book of Vishanti. Can you take us there? 
Christine 2: How am I supposed to trust you? 
Strange: I know what happened. I'm sorry for what he did. But believe me, the Book of Vishanti is the only way. 
Christine 2: Yeah. Your way. You sound a lot like my Stephen right now. He had to be the one holding the knife, and then that knife kept controlling people. 
America: This Stephen is different. He is. It doesn't matter about all the other Stephens. They're not like him. 
Strange: Smart kid. 
Christine 2: Give me your hand. Do not make me regret this. 
Strange: I won't. 
America: Okay, can we go now? 
Christine 2: Follow me. 
Strange: Where does that tunnel go? 
Christine 2: Under the river. 
Strange: Go. Go, go, go! 
Wanda: I warned you. 
Strange: Other Wanda, if you're in there, hold your breath. 
America: Did it kill her? 
Strange: No, but it bought us some time. 
Christine 2: The book's through here. But only Stephen's ever opened it. 
Strange: Shit. A chant only specific to me, something only I would know. Come on. 
Christine 2: Stephen... 
Strange: Come on... 
Christine 2: Stephen! 
Strange: Yeah. Thank you. 
Christine 2: Sure. 
Strange: Open sesame. Come on, kid. You got this. 
America: I got this. 
Christine 2: Yeah. 
Strange: Are you all right? 
Christine 2: Yeah. This is the gap junction. The space between universes. 
Strange: All right, Book... Give me what I need. 
Wanda 2: My boys. 
America: This isn't what your children would want. 
Wanda: They'll never know. 
America: Maybe not. But you will. 
Strange: Oh, no. Oh, crap! 
Christine 2: It's like, this reality collapsed in on itself. 
Strange: Yeah. Two realities collided. Come on. America doesn't have long. 
Christine 2: So where are we going? 
Strange: Well, if there's still a Sanctum in this universe, then there might be another, other, "other me", and that's our best shoot at getting back to her. Well, I can see why you guys were so worried about incursions. 
Christine 2: Whatever happened... this universe's you didn't do a very good job of stopping it. 
Strange: I'll tell him you said that. Hello? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Stop where you are. How did you get here? 
Strange: By accident. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Who are you... what are you? 
Strange: I'm just, one of us. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: From the Multiverse? 
Strange: That's right. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Prove it. 
Strange: We had a sister. Donna. She, uh... She died, when we were kids. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: How? 
Strange: We were... playing on a frozen lake, and... She fell through the ice. I couldn't save her. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Sounds about right. But we don't talk about that, do we? 
Strange: No, we don't. I suppose your reality wasn't always like this? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: I suspect it'd be somewhat like yours, until... 
Strange: Until? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Until I lost. 
Strange: To who? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: What do you want? 
Strange: I just want to get home. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Yeah, believe me... I've been trying to leave this place for a long time. 
Strange: The Darkhold. You guard the Darkhold in this universe? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Yeah. For good reason. 
Strange: That's a start. I could use it. It could help me to communicate with my universe. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Careful. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll. 
Strange: I don't mean to be callous, but, how much of a heavier toll is there left to exact? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Not just on its reality... On its reader. 
Strange: Look, I'm sorry you couldn't save your own universe, but maybe, you could help to save mine? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Are you happy, Stephen? 
Strange: What? 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Are you happy, Stephen? It's the question that... Christine Palmer asked me at her wedding. I said, yes, of course, I'm happy. I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods. What man wouldn't be happy? Then I, came back to this god darn haunted house. Sat down... and wondered why I'd lied. I never meant for any of this to happen. I was looking for a world where things were different. Where I had Christine. Where I was... happy. But I didn't find it. All I found were more of us. So I did those Stephens a favor. You ever had that dream where you're falling, as if you've been pushed off a tall building? That was probably me. The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll. 
Strange: Okay. All the more reason to give it a rest, so let me have it. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: Here's the deal. I'll let you use the Darkhold... if you give me your Christine. 
Strange: Yeah... I don't think she's gonna go for that. 
Sinister Stephen Strange: No? Didn't think so. 
Strange: Hang on. We're coming. 
Christine 2: What are you doing with the Darkhold? Are you going to dreamwalk? 
Strange: Slightly more than just dreamwalking. 
Christine 2: All you Stranges, you're the same. 
Strange: I know. You're right. We are all the same. But right now, that kid needs me, and I can't do any of this without your help. While I'm under, I need you to protect my body, in case they attack me for trespassing. 
Christine 2: Who's "they"? 
Strange: The Souls of the Damned. 
Christine 2: Okay. But doesn't a version of you need to live in that universe? So that you can dreamwalk into them. 
Strange: Who said they have to be living? 
Souls of the Damned: Stephen Strange, possessing a dead body is forbidden! Cease your dreamwalk, and face the eternal consequences. 
Christine 2: Stephen! Don't let me go. Stephen? Hang on. Hang on, hang on. Brazier of Bom'Galiath. Go back to hell. Stephen... I've got you. You're a Master of the Mystic Arts. They're spirits. Use them. Use them. Use them. 
Wong: Come on! Uh-oh. Strange! 
Wanda: Dreamwalking, you hypocrite! 
Strange: This time, it's gonna take more than killing me to kill me. 
Wong: I don't even wanna know. She's breaking free! 
Strange: Hold her! 
Wong: Strange! Take America's power. There's no other way. 
Strange: Yeah. This is the only way. It's me, in other me's body. 
America: You're gonna take my power, aren't you? Before Wanda can. It's okay. I understand now. 
Strange: No, America. I've come here to tell you to trust yourself, trust your power. That's how we stop her. 
America: I can't control it... 
Strange: Yes, you can. You have been all along. Every time you opened a portal, you sent us exactly where we needed to go. 
America: What about the first time? 
Strange: Even that led you to this moment. You are gonna kick that witch's ass. 
Christine 2: I've got you! 
Wanda: Uh-huh. 
America: I can't b*at you. So I'll give you what you want. 
Wanda: Billy. Tommy. 
Billy: Mommy! 
Tommy: There's a witch! 
Wanda: What have you done?! 
Billy: Mommy! 
Wanda 2: Wait! Boys. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. 
Wanda: I'm their mother! Get away from them. 
Strange: No. Not yet. 
Tommy: Mommy! 
Billy: Get away from our mom! Leave her alone! 
Wanda: Boys, stop. Please. Wait, boys. Stop. Stop it! 
Billy: Please don't hurt us. Please. 
Wanda: I would never hurt you. Never. I would never hurt anyone. I'm not a monster. I'm not... I'm... 
Tommy: Mom. You're okay. 
Wanda: Okay, okay... I'm okay... 
Tommy: Mom, no! 
Billy: Don't go. Don't. Mom... 
Wanda 2: Know that they'll be loved. 
America: What now? 
Strange: Get out of here. 
America: I'll find you. We have to go. Now. 
Wanda: I opened the Darkhold. I have to close it. No one will ever be tempted by the Darkhold again. 
Strange: Are you all right? 
Christine 2: Is it over?
Strange: Yeah. 
Christine 2: Is America okay? 
Strange: She's on her way here to get us. 
Christine 2: Wanda? 
Strange: No. So she destroyed the Darkhold in every universe. 
Christine 2: She did the right thing. 
Strange: Yes, she did. 
Christine 2: What's your universe like? 
Strange: It's very beautiful. I wish I could show you. 
Christine 2: I'd really like that. But I... have to go. 
Strange: Yeah. Yeah, I know. 
Christine 2: It's too bad, though. Could have been one hell of an incursion. 
Strange: I love you. I love you in every universe. It's not that I don't wanna care for someone, or have someone care for me. It's just... I get scared. 
Christine 2: Yeah. Face your fears. Doctor Strange. 
America: How is this so much harder than a Multiversal portal? 
Strange: She needs to slow down, and be more patient. 
Wong: Reminds me of another student I knew. How are you feeling? 
Strange: Why do you ask? 
Wong: You used the Darkhold to dreamwalk into your own corpse. 
Strange: Oh. Yeah, right, uh... I'm fine. But I do wanna ask you something. Are you happy? 
Wong: That's a... interesting question. 
Strange: You'd think that saving the world would get you there, but... It doesn't. 
Wong: Sometimes, I do wonder... of my other lives. Yet I remain grateful in this one. Even with each tribulations. 
Strange: Soon we'll have to go through a long one. 
Wong: No, we don't. 
America: Wait. 'Sup? 
Strange: 'Sup?
<b>America Chavez:</b> Made some sparks.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> Great. Your parents would be proud. I hope you'll get to show them one day.
<b>America Chavez:</b> Stephen? I'm glad I found your universe.
<b>Doctor Stephen Strange:</b> So am I, kid. So am I. Hmm. (YELLING IN PAIN) (SCREAMING)
<b>Clea</b>: Doctor Strange?
<b>Docotr Stephen Strange</b>: Can I help you?
<b>Clea</b>: You caused an Incursion, and we’re gonna fix it. Unless you’re afraid.
